 Terrible Communication by Public Health Hi there, 

I started feeling symptoms sometime this week, and went the next day to get a swab done. Two family members of mine started feeling symptoms the exact same day as me and also went for swabs within a few hours of me (at different testing center).  

At the testing center I was told by the Dr. to isolate in my house until results are available. I was also given a pamphlet on which each pages describes what to do in each specific scenario. My specific scenario was:  

\- feeling symptoms  

\- not close contact with a case  

\- not travelled outside Canada  

  

Under what to do for testing Negative it says:  

"if your test is negative, you may stop self-isolating after you are symptom free for 24 hours. A follow-up test is not required. You can return to activities (e.g., work) at this time"  

  

Luckily all 3 of us tested negative.

Now, here's where I'm really frustrated. Only 1 of my family members from the other testing center received a follow up call AFTER receiving test results, to say that they still must isolate for 14 days in case of false negative.  The other family member who got tested within minutes of them received no such call. I received no such instruction at all (or so I thought).  

I decided to dig into my online results and saw that there were appointment notes separate from the test results (I received no email about these notes and was never instructed to look for them).  At the very bottom of these notes it reads:  

"Current COVID swabbing criteria have been discussed with patient.

  If symptomatic - self isolation for 14 days from symptom onset.  

If swabbed - they will be contacted by public health or the hospital with the results.  

If negative - should stay home and self isolate at least 14 days after symptoms started in case swab falsely negative.  

If not swabbed - self isolate at least 14 days after symptoms started.  

Close contacts should also stay home and self isolate for at least 14 days.  

Information package given to patient."  

  

1. the first line is a lie, this was NOT discussed with me.
2. this direction contradicts their own information package they mention.  
3. my 1 family member who received the call received no instruction about close contacts isolating.   

This is a complete embarrassment of communication.   Everyone should be told AT the testing center to isolate 14 days (not after results), and they should be told the full story that close contacts should isolate.  

End rant.

 Do I need quarantine for connection flights? I am traveling to Vancouver from Europe, I have an open work permit and a job offer.

I would like to know if I make a stop in Montreal or Toronto for a couple of hours because of a connection flight, am I required to do a quarantine in that place for 14 days or am I able to stay in the airport for a couple of hours and then proceed to Vancouver?

Additionally, I am aware I can't go out during the 14-day quarantine. Are there any services that allow me to buy groceries from supermarkets and have them delivered to my door?

 Calling All 3D Printer Programers I am requesting that someone design a mask that can be printed on 3D printers, that can provide personal protection and allow a replaceable filter.  


I am not sure if it can be done, but if you can design it, it could save hundreds of lives and you could become famous.
