 As a realtor, should I still be selling houses? I just want to get everyone's opinion on this. Personally, I feel obligated to stay home with my family during this time and stop business activities temporarily. Luckily I have enough savings to keep me going for a few months without being financially stretched. But from what I've seen on the realtor groups on FB, it seems that most of the realtors are continue to do their daily activities, which include meeting clients, showing homes, and hosting open houses, all of which bring them in contact with other people.

 Why does hand sanitizer smells so bad? Before Covid, there. Was a few name brand hand sanitizers with a fairly neutral smell or mild alcohol smell.

Now it seems that every store sell never heard of brands and they are all so potent I'm almost getting drunk off the fumes.

Is it necessary to smell that bad to be effective? Was pre-Covid hand sanitizer not efficient?

 Border closures vs child custody agreements Good day all,

Hopefully this is allowed. If not.. delete I guess, I dunno.

So I'm in the military. I am living in NB, my children live in NS, and I am currently in Ontario, where i have been since early August on training.

I am coming home to NB next month for christmas. Now before y'all get mad about travelling during covid, just know that we, here on base, have basically been confined to our barracks, pretty much iso, since we arrived here. We wear masks at all times, and follow all covid guidelines, and will continue to do so on our travels to our home provinces. Pre holiday isolation begins soon.

There has been a lot of talk coming from the atlantic bubble about border closures. When I come home I plan on dashing down to Nova Scotia to pick up my kids and come right back to my place in NB where we will spend christmas. 

Question is, if the NB/NS border closes, will there be some exemptions? Surely C19 cannot interfere with child custody, can it? 

Please, no opinionated answers, especially if you're just going to get all Karen about it. If there are any border control personnel, or family lawyers that know what the deal is, in here that could give some insight, it would be very much appreciated.

It would be myself, my wife, and my toddler at home (we've been isolated almost entirely).

 Coronavirus wont stop here unless Hello Everyone,
I don't have much insights on how  well are we prepared for a full fledge lockdown whether its Economically or resourcefully that we have but one thing i know is that we need to be strict about the rules that have been implemented. I still see people roaming around unnecessarily, Playing Football in my nearby park, cycling on streets or talking a stroll especially old age people.
If this continues then we are on the wrong track and the only way to come out of this would be a vaccine which will take next 8-10 months.
We have to learn Do's and Don’ts from other country. 
Yesterday i was scrolling through some stats where Australia and Canada were together in terms of coronavirus count at a particular time in fact Canada had less number of cases but now i see Australia has almost 1/3rd of cases than Canada. I checked their testing stats too I thought probably they are not testing enough but i was wrong they were testing more than Canada.
I am not saying what went wrong here but what i am saying is how we can also stop this Pandemic. Below are few key points from Doctors working in Wuhan on how China maintained this, and it actually never flourished to cities like Beijing and Shanghai.

1. Mask is Mandatory.
2. Lockdown should be treated as a lockdown. No playing or scrolling or running in the park.
3. Create a Mobile Application which tells whether there is anyone nearby having Symptoms or 
   there is a positive COVID19 Patient around them  and people should not be allowed to enter any
   Grocery or drug mart without scanning.
4. Few of the basic things that are required to come out of home is touching the elevator buttons,
   Opening the gates. We should have a Cling film or plastic wrap which should be changed in every 2-3 hours
5. Streets should be blocked, and police checks are required where they will be checking for body temperature.
6. Testing Results should be communicated within minutes of test.
7. Stop International flights any kind of Flights.

I know we are Humble and Polite but we need to take some harsh steps to contain this Pandemic else it will keep on flourishing. We have examples like US where they are still struggling.
It’s a Cycle of 14 days + 10 days once we obey the rules we will be come out of it and we will have our normal lives and if we don’t obey then it will keep on spreading and we know what will happen to economy if we are stuck in this loop. Each and every single person out their will make a difference.
Please share if it makes sense to you

 Ontario long term strategy Looking for some discussion.

While I was commenting on other threads I just started thinking on certain thoughts. Our officials always say they are planning for worst cases scenarios. Now the interesting thing that comes up is they always talk about a potential of a vaccine or cure, some stroke of genius.

Now lets look at our current situation. People are starting to understand that we may be having a postivie effect on our curve. Capacity at hospitals is going up and materials and ppe are coming in all good things. Here is where the problem is. Without widespread testing how are we supposed to understand how wide our infection rate is and also how do we forecast for a second inevitable surge.

If this is truly planning for worst case scenario we have to plan as if no vaccine or cure will be available, and our current testing regime fails to protect us for our second and subsequent waves of infections. The rate of achieving any kind of community or herd immunity is not feasible at the rate we are infecting.

Any thoughts?

 Does the app tell you WHEN you were exposed? I'm curious... Because if you were exposed 14 days prior to receiving the alert, it's quite a major difference than a few days (Someone could have been tested the same day they were 15 minutes next to you, and the results would be back 1-2 days later, in which you would get alert).

Between how many you would have to alert who spent time a decent amount of time with you, to how accurate the test will be (requires at least 5 or so days from exposure to be accurate).

 Please tell me if you think I'm crazy to be wondering about this I've been following this since the news broke, I have an autoimmune condition and travel a lot.   I flew to Hawaii Dec 28th and had time to start learning while away on holidays.  My flight was via Maui to Big Island for 3 weeks ish, felt great while there.  Upon returning home Jan 22 (when extra screening was supposed to be happening, but I noted nothing different) 2 days later I was ill.  It was a redeye flight home, I had 2 extra seats beside me and was so excited to sleep, I didn't put my mask on as usual.  

I work for myself so stayed home and kept googling for info on the differences between a flu &amp; covid-19.  My symptoms were dry cough, nothing in my sinuses, fever, exhausted, and very achy, near the end a sore throat which I mostly attributed to the dry hacking cough, and then there was finally phlegm at about day 10, the cough continued for 3 weeks.   It was the worst flu I've ever had by far.

At the time, the symptoms we were being told about definitely excluded the achy body and sniffles that some are now reporting.  I was calling it a flu, didn't go to docs or anything, just stayed home.  Now that we are aware that the US completely dropped the ball on testing, and that Japan had it's first case Jan 16th and has multiple direct flights to Maui in a day, I'm really wishing there was an antibody test.  

Here's the other thing, the meds I take for the autoimmune condition are hydroxychloroquine, which have been in clinical trails as a possible treatment for covid-19.  

Am I nuts to be wondering if I could have already had the virus?  Has anyone seen anything about antibody tests for this?

 The testing situation in Ontario in the upcoming days. As of Sunday the 4th, no more walk-ins will be allowed at testing centers and testing by appointment will only start on the 6th. 

So after today, we will have to go through a phone call conversation where we're told to come get tested or not, like in the initial months. Let's consider the logistics of 40,000 people or more trying to get through phone lines in one day to talk to someone.

Finally, from the 4th to the 6th, no tests at all, just working on backlog. We are voluntarily going to go 2 whole days without testing anyone in the middle of a sharp increase in cases. 

A+ job, for real. From "everyone should get tested!" to shutting down testing for two days to work on a backlog due to a lack of preparedness. 

Am I missing anything?

 Pressure from family to visit, have dinner with and share a cabin for a week as a potentially high risk person. Looking for any insight on our situation I don’t know how high risk I am but I had asthma as a kid/teen but I haven’t had any issues with it for a long long time. I’ve heard that getting sick enough could trigger it again even though I haven’t had a puffer in many years. I was also taking hydroxychloroquine (an immune suppressant) for the last 6 months as of last Sunday I’ve stopped taking it (doctor approved). 

I’ve been treating myself as high risk but my boyfriends family is putting a fair bit of pressure on us to visit which we have done outside and not eating or drinking anything but we get pressured to eat treats like cakes and tea or coffee. It’s uncomfortable having to repeatedly say no we are ok thanks over and over again. We’ve told them why we are being so careful but it hasn’t really helped. 

With Father’s Day coming up my bf and his brothers are taking him to go golfing, which is fine in my book (outside and easy enough to distance from each other) but after they want us to come for dinner. The couple times we’ve been there they don’t do a very good job keeping distance and again we are constantly pushed to eat and drink. Plus I’m pretty sure they will want to be inside (this would likely be a 9 person gathering from 4 households). 

This is where I think I might be being overly cautious but I don’t really feel like they are being careful enough. They are eating fast food, grocery shopping every week, and the brothers with their SO’s are hanging out with friends and family a fair bit. Camping and hiking not really keeping distance from what I can tell from pictures. 

On top of all this before all this went down we were planning on sharing a cabin for a week in July and they still want to do it. It looks like three out of the nine might not be there but still I don’t think it’s a good idea. But at the same time am I being ridiculous? I don’t know I’m high risk.. And the number of new cases in B.C. is continuing to drop... the chances that any of them have been in contact with someone contagious might be pretty unlikely. Buuuttt... my mom recently had their first positive case at her work...  

Basically, we are having trouble dealing with it diplomatically and rationally as someone who may be high risk.

 Corona Virus NCOV Strategy Corner: Stay At Home Is Defense, Herd Knowledge Immunity Is Attack **Corona Virus NCOV Strategy Corner: Stay At Home Is Defense, Herd Knowledge Immunity Is Attack**  
 

Do you know what entity is the author of the stay-at-home strategy many national governments are using? The answer is me. I was published that solution to slow the spread of the virus in January 28th 2020 at **theworld.data.blog** and have shared it in many online platform as well. At that time the people in China still have no clue what is going on and still allow people run around.  
 

If you do not believe that, then you can do your own research or ask your government, secret societies, etc. a simple question “**Who is the author of stay at home strategy?**”  
 

The media and governments have no clue what is going on. While I know the enemy very well and I only telling you the truth, the real winning strategy just like the “stay at home” one, while the Governments are gambling your live rather than saving your live.  
 

In any war, any game match, there are always 2 basic strategy: attack mode and defense mode.  
 

When you use “stay at home” strategy, which mean you are using defense strategy in the first half of the match, in the early you have no clue what is going on. That is the best isolation tactics.  
 

Many stupid nation governments doing the positive negative test for the COVID-19 NCOV, for what? Corona virus is not a lion, it can spread in air, in water. Mass test strategy is just waste of time. For the ultimate purpose of that strategy is just to isolating people.  
 

**So ask yourself, which strategy is better?**  
 Stay at home because you do not have spend any resources. While mass test take long long time, and people would have all infected before you finish the test. And even test method many are using is just a pure scam, cannot detect the corona virus at root.  
 

Do you know those stupid politicians thinks isolating and treat infected people can end this epic battle? It too funny and freaking stupid !!!  
 

But you cannot using defense mode forever, you must “attack” the corona virus with real knowledge power. What if corona virus infect into the water supply, lake, river, then we would have the crazy chaos times with billions people gonna to die for sure.  
 

And the only winning attack strategy is “Herd Knowledge Immunity”, where people will allowed to share their thought, their idea, their solution relate to the new corona virus NCOV.  
 

Many secret government, secret groups who are researching the corona virus with their top notch machines know that “this corona virus is unpredictable, and do not have any clear pattern on all cases, the mechanism of this virus is base on each human body host”. And more importantly they are causing more fear everyday, where is the hope, where is the sign of light? Absolutely zero !!!  
 

It was first called as novel virus, new corona virus NCOV. So you must treat it as a novel, where people will freely allow to post to tell any theory and “cure” they think is gonna to work, and let each people decide. No any entities have right to tell “God is this but not that”, so stop telling people they are wrong, unless you have a absolutely correct one. And the authorities, governments have no clue what is truth !!!  
 

That is the public strategy and policy the authority must be use, there is no other choice.  
 I am not going to telling the cure on this blog directly and freely for many entities can steal it, just like the stay-at-home strategy the governments have stolen but did not even ask or give any credit in return.  
 

I do not waste time to post useless strategy, I only post winning strategy for the entire game and the truth.  
 Who can prove the information I have shared are not the truth? I willing to close the entire website instantly. Oh nobody, because that is the hard eternal truth.  
 

Best Regard,

 Was sad to see The Eagle's Nest Park was closed on the weekend in Bancroft Ontario I am all for safety protocols but opening parks should be a priority. 

This weekend in Bancroft Ontario Eagle's Nest lookout was still closed to visitors.  I took the kids there to hike a bit on the paths (they're not extreme - literally just kind of flat trails but it's a nice view).  It has wide paths, it's a PARK (not much of one by big city standards but this is cottage country) , everyone going there can take reasonable precautions, and it was nice weather. 

And NO there weren't swarming crowds at this park, and there never have been as long as I've been going there. 

But it's ok to go into stores where we know this thing spreads.  

People have things bass-ackwards.

 Boss making me work back at office. I have been working from home for the last few weeks. Everything has seemed to be fine and I am still getting the same amount, or more, work done. My boss now feels that having some of us return to the office to work will help keep our shop having more work to do. I have been back a few days since working from home to measure some of the stuff I was required to draw so we can remake the parts.

There is very little being done on site to keep us safe. Most people are not obeying social distancing in the shop and there is no PPE provided for us.  We have been deemed essential since we manufacture and install equipment for the agricultural industry.

Is there anything I can do to keep working from home. Also he is not having all the office staff come back only a couple of us for what seems like no real reason. He sent me an e-mail to inform me of this change today (Thursday April 9) and he expects me back Monday morning.

I am very concerned as I live in staff housing and have seen ambulances and paramedics in hazmat suits in staff housing where I live. I have a feeling the mountain will be closing sooner than later and covid19 will spread like rapid fire in staff housing. I am just so concerned with going to the airport and airplane. Should I quarantine myself when I return home? I’m an 18 year old male but still very worried. It’s only a matter of time before domestic travel restrictions occur and we know this virus is just going to get worse before it gets better. I have the worst job when it comes to catching it and am just thinking it may be smart to leave while I can and before it gets too bad.

 I live with my grandparents and work at a grocery store. If I stay home will I qualify for the CERB? I worked at a restaurant that did not pay me correctly and then refused to fix it. So I quit and filed a claim with the labour board. The next day the NBA was cancelled, the NHL, almost every big event. I started freaking out that I wouldn't get a job so I applied at a grocery store. They hired me the next day and after my first day I started reading more into coronavirus. I live with my grandparents who are both over 70 and one of which had cancer last year. Also my wife works with high risk medically fragile clients.

I am now worried about bringing the virus home. I don't know if I should self isolate or just try to do my best to sanitize and wash my hands and not touch my face and not get too close to my grandparents. I feel stupid for leaving right after starting and like I should have thought of this all before applying but the fact is I didn't and I can't go back in time so now I'm not sure what to do. If I quit I won't get hired back in the future and it's a decent job. But I don't want to bring something home. I also don't know if I will qualify for the CERB or not.

Any help or advice appreciated. What would you do in this situation?

 Why is it hard for our Government.... I am wondering why it is even a question to help all Canadian citizens to stay home. No one at this point should ever have to worry about their children, homes, jobs and bills. The world is in a pandemic and it is only the rich  whom are supported. Meanwhile we are the ones in our society that put them in power.  The populace supported them, so they should and have to support us. 


Ei is not enough. Not everyone will get it. 


This virus will not be shut down until full effort is put into it.

I'm sick of hearing influencer getting paid to do what they do while staying home complaining about being "sO bOrEd" and saying how hard it is. 

This is really taking a toll on the poorest and the homeless people. I'm so scared that they're gonna let them die on the street. It's taking a toll on small business owners who had to close permenantly because closing for 3 weeks was not an option they could afford.

Please people, we're all in the same boat of isolation, but please, stop complainigng when you have a roof over your head, when you have enough money to feed yourself and your children, when you are healthy enough to not have to worry too much about it taking your life and make permanent damage. When you don't have to worry about your landlord kicking you out and becoming homeless. 

And please if you have a yard and a big house above all of this. You have no right to complain, some people are going to die because they could not afford to live through a pandemic. Some people don't even have enough money to have the internet.

But please, still stay safe, stay home, everyone is important but don't forget some people are less fortunate than you are...

 GO reducing service. While ridership is declining and I understand that less riders equals less money, maybe it's a good thing that the trains and buses have less people in them.
I hope they really consider the consequences when making the schedule changes. Cramming many people into few vehicles makes sense financially becauses it maximizes the profit made on each trip but it also maximizes "profit" for the virus. Sometimes the right thing for a company to do ends up hurting their bottom line. Sacrifices need to be made to help mitigate spread of this thing, everyone needs to work together to try and flatten the curve.
Otherwise they're going to be seeing an even steeper decline in ridership until they're forced to stop service all together.

 Coronavirus stats (plotted) and predictive trend analysis for Canada Hi Folks,

On the weekend I was considering having a gathering of friends, but wanted to get a better understanding of the risks associated with doing so. So I did some analysis on the situation in Hubei (China) and used that data as a model to estimate the number of *actual* cases in Canada, based on the cases that we *know* (i.e. confirmed reported cases). I've projected this forward (based on current trends) and also included a predictive analysis based on social distancing practices nationwide.

I'd like some reviews/thoughts on the "predictive analytics" plot on the far-right side, where I estimate deviation in the trend based on the user-defined values in the two yellow cells. Want to be sure the math/logic works out. For any math/stats/etc folks in here, if you're interested!

See [this link]( for a "protected" version of the spreadsheet. The cells highlighted in yellow are the parameters that you can change (scroll down in the spreadsheet to see them). You can see the impact of those values on the green plot in the "data visualization" chart - this shows the "actual" cases. You can also see how it impacts the "trend deviation" graph (purple curve).

See [this link]( for an unlocked version that you can contribute to if you have thoughts/comments or any corrections. Note: I have a backup lol.

Note that these are only a predictions. See "Assumptions and Disclaimers" in the spreadsheet for more info.

I've ordered from Inabuggy many times, and before they change an order they usually call and confirm - I have strict dietary needs which I specified on my order and the guy who's packing just goes and switches everything to items I CANT eat, then goes to LCBO and buys me 12 beers and charges me for 12 CASES of beer. $350 charge for 4 items. I rejected the order at the door because I could not eat any of it, they charged me anyway. Wont answer the phone, wont answer e-mails.   
Being that I have experience with them I figured they would refund me shortly, and I ordered a new order for my grandmother (a senior citizen who cant leave the house) 10 days ago. They just cancelled the order with no prior notice and left us stranded.

  
This company might be busy now, but it's not excuse for stealing peoples money and leaving loyal customers who depend on them stranded. They have taken money from students and charged alot of peoples credit cards thousands of dollars. This is not about me, this is about them not being able to do this to innocent people during this Covid crisis. 

I need everyone to help me make a difference as the are charging people and not refunding - please look at other reviews if you dont believe me but please make a negative review on their google company in order that they will start having to deal with actually helping people they are scamming. 

Just a side note; Look up “Julian Gleizer"
He is the owner of Inabuggy and happens to be he had an old company " Dealticker" That was taking peoples money for months after they closed, and stole it all and ran. All of the evidence is online in news releases etc, he likes taking advantage of people when they need him. Please help me make a difference by sharing this and making reviews so that they have to pay attention to them. Please bump this thread and help this stay active.

 Weekly Subreddit Update #7: Bans, subreddit feedback Hey there!  

Sorry this was so late.  I'm going to conflate this with the missed one as we've all been very busy -- some of us have been called back into work.  

#**Bans**

We are up to 49 bans (+4) from 16 days ago.  This is good.  We've had a couple of temporary bans, but they've since elapsed.  

* 3 were banned for bigotry, racism, or harassment;
* 1 was banned for self-advertising and banned by Reddit

Please keep in mind that civility is paramount.  We're all stuck at home for the most part, and there's a great deal of stress for everyone.  Let's try and be mindful of that. 

I don't have much to share at the moment.  Most of Ontario is into stage 2, but Toronto, Peel, and York are still in stage 1.  We anticipate some changes in the coming days, but let's hope that the numbers continue their downwards trend.  

As the country is slowly breaking out of the first stage, we would like to hear what kind of changes are needed in the subreddit to support those discussions.  Please provide your feedback here.

 I have a [question] about my job and mild illness I went to work at 6am with a small cough. I told my manager they asked am I OK to keep working or do I want to go home. I said I feel fine I'll work. As couple hours went by I felt worse. (btw I work retail). I told my manager i feel worse what should I do. They said they can't tell me. It's up to me. I said I think it's best if I go home and call my doctor. They said if I go home ill have to provide proof that I was tested in order to come back to work and it doesn't matter what my doctor says. I'm waiting for a call from my doctor. I just want to stay isolated in my home for 14 days. I don't want to go get tested. Can I be fired for not complying with my company who's telling me to do this? I been in bed all day. My anxiety is bad. I don't want to go anywhere. What do I do?

 having a panic attack... Guys I'm so scared, I only learned how devastating this is over the last 3-4 days... im such an idiot. I can't even focus on work or relationships because what's the point it seems like this is way worse than anyone is letting on and people are just happy doing their thing while all I can think about is how stupid this will all look 2 months down the road when we're all fucked with dead bodies and mutations

 Have to take a week off from work. What do I do? I understand the seriousness of the virus first hand but I don't have a good home life. I can't stay at home during my week off as it will only further contribute to the degradation of my mental health or I'll log in and continue working. I am in Ontario and I want to drive somewhere else and spend my week alone in isolation. I don't plan on meeting people or anything like that while I'm away. But I desperately want to get away from home for the week that I have off. 

I wanted to drive to Quebec City and Mont Tremblant but I'm not sure if it's a good idea. Any suggestions? Or do I just suck it up and stay home?

 Whats the plan if a vaccine is never found? I've been reading a little, and it seems like there is a decent possibility that a vaccine will never be found.  In that case, what do we do?  Do we just kinda say "fuck it" and let people do what they want?  Do we go for herd immunity?  Do we just kinda stay like this for the rest of our lives?  And at what point do we decide to say "fuck it" or try for herd immunity?  We can't have lockdowns for years.

 Canada Post stopping home package delivery I haven't heard anything official, but a tracked package was en route to my home today and without a delivery attempt was directed to my nearby post office.

I called Canada Post and was told via their toll free customer service that "packages for home delivery that cannot be left outside unattended are being directed to post offices".

I then called the post office location where my package was supposed to have arrived + ready for pick up 3 hours before. Not only did they not have any idea package deliveries had stopped, but they couldn't find my package either.

So seems the left hand doesn't know what the right is doing, packages are getting re-routed/lost mid-delivery and likely we'll see mail interruptions soon too.

 Something that may help I put the story from the previous 6 podcasts on hold, at least for one podcast, so that I can help maybe with a little advice and to answer a question or two.  The only goal of this is to help and maybe inform. I'm looking at the worst of this through a kind of rear-view mirror and am a reminder you can get through this.

 There is no testing or screening happening at borders or airports! Family just made it home from Mexico, crossing the border into MB. No temperatures taken, they just received a pamphlet telling them about the outbreak. The border guards are not wearing masks or any kind of protection. Friend just flew into Vancouver from Bali. No temperature taken, no  assessment or questionnaire, no one said anything to them about self isolation, nothing. Same in Calgary airport. Same in Winnipeg. The government is saying that no one with symptoms will be allowed in the country but no one is getting tested or questioned about symptoms anyway. They're not even being warned about the now-mandatory 14 day isolation period! Anyone else hearing the same kind of stories from this week?

My SO is calling me crazy for wanting to socially distance myself (and our family). He isn’t so I’m trying my best but it’s a moot point as he continues to go about his day to day routine. 

I keep telling him I hope I’m wrong that it won’t be that bad. He is adamant that there won’t be even above a 100k in death globally and I’m just such a 60minutes mom. 😑

Meanwhile I hear Alberta just canceled the school semester for the rest of the term. OLG is shut down casinos. Sports r not playing. So much is shut down I can’t understand why he doesn’t think this is worse then the flu.

 Quebec couple who got coronavirus on cruise ship to come home, daughter says

 Am I eligible for CERB? I’m in kind of a complicated situation and haven’t been able to find a clear answer. 

I’m a full time university student and cashier at a grocery store. At the beginning of March I accepted a summer job offer with the intention to quit my cashier job in May. 

I live at home with my parents (who both work essential jobs) and 3 younger siblings. 2 weeks ago I was working about 14 hours a week and my mom determined the risk is not worth it, because someone needed to stay home with my siblings and I was expected to make more than enough to cover next years tuition this summer. 

So two weeks ago I asked to take an unpaid leave from my cashier job. Yesterday I was informed that my summer job will not be going ahead as planned. Now I have zero income.

In summary: 
I’m unsure if I qualify because I left my cashier job voluntarily. But I did lose my summer income which I am dependent on for tuition. 

Thank you!

 What will summer 2021 look like in Canada? What do you expect summer 2021 (June to August)  to look like here in Canada?

&amp;#x200B;

* What will be the state of a vaccine, will canada have access to it?
* Will social distancing/mask mandates still be around? Will most people still be wearing masks/social distancing?
* Will concerts/sporting events be on?
* Will schools/universities be in person by fall 2021
* What will the state of travelling internationally be like? Will borders be open fully again?
* Will the economy be even worse if things arent back to normal?
* And most importantly, how will people be coping then? If restrictions arent eased by then, do you expect people to continue complying (somewhat) like they are now? Or will people just have hit their breaking points by then?

 Any studies on catching the virus twice? I just tested positive a week ago with mild symptoms except the first 2-3 days where I had a very uncomfortable fever. My incubation period ends the 20th.

 EI, or some kind of program established to help people who need to stay home from work, but don’t have paid sick time at their employment. Should Canada be setting this up as Canadians start to get asked to stay home if sick?

 Is it possible to convert coom industrial re-usable respirator into a ventilator?  Is it possible or practical to convert a standard or common 3m or north respirator mask into a ventilator? These are very common worldwide.  3m 6000 or 7500 series probably most common. I'm sure its been considered. Link to mask type provided. I just saw a post regarding converting a scuba mask with some 3d printed parts.   Alternately but far less common are the full face versions of these if that is necessary.

 Just returned to Canada from vacation in the USA, boss still wants me to come in. I work for an airline... I don't want to say specifically what airline or what airport i work at, but i do work on the front counter for a major airline.  I told my manager last week when I departed, we joked about how we hoped it didn't escalate by the time I returned.  I had 4 flights , which had Seattle as a layover on both directions.  I had spent a week in total in the USA.  Now we've been told by the health minister we are encouraged and expected to stay at home for 14 days if we've returned from the USA.  I just got home today, but he expects me to come in Monday still because its not a "mandatory " thing and I wont be paid if i self-isolate at home.  Unless things change, should I not worry and go in Monday? My gut feels i should stay at home...
