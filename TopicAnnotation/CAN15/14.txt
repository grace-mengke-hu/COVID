 Anybody know what the government recommendations are for birthday parties etc. right now in ontario?  

&amp;#x200B;

My daughter is having a birthday coming up, and I would absolutely love to have a party for her, but I'm not exactly sure where the recommendations are right now. FYI it's not exactly up to my discretion either because (and I'm not gonna really go into this much) but me and my coparent or actually legally obligated to follow send recommendations. Anyway I would appreciate any responses very much!

 Why does social distancing info seem slightly unclear? Since the first few days of March, I’ve been social distancing and taking this whole thing very seriously. I understand that staying home is the best course of action for everyone and it’s extremely important that we all abide by this, but I’m a bit confused about the way these measures are being expressed by our government. 

Example: we are told that we should stay home and avoid contact with people, but also can hang out in groups of up to 5... how does that make sense? And if you’ve been social distancing for more than 2 weeks and someone else has been strictly following that protocol as well, does it mean that it’s safe to begin incorporating those select few into your life (as long as it’s not in public and not in a group?)

 the reason we need a lockdown my brother is now going shopping for a forth time in four days. I just dont understand how what you dont understand about staying home. His list today

  
1) toilet paper. (he only has 10 rolls left!!)  
2) dog shampoo  
3) toothpaste (which i have some)  


My boss sent me home tuesday so i called my brother and asked if he needed anything from the store. We agreed to split and extra $100 for food on top of our already bi weekly amount in case we do get locked down which will happen because it seems like everyone is a moron in this country.   


All i have to say is get ready to be treated like convicts because people cant stay inside for a bit

 My Dad Died From Covid-19 (Toronto) - AMA It's been almost a week since he's passed. I 'think' this is going to be therapeutic for me, and hopefully act as an awareness campaign to continue to be safe as we re-open.

Basic info: Toronto ON, he passed at Humber River Hospital, was there fighting this for 17 days, the final 7 of which were on the ventilator. He turned 66, four days before he passed as he was sedated, he had underlying respiratory issues.

All I ask is that you avoid conspiracy/extreme topics (they killed him, 5g, cashless society, it's fake, forced vax/chip, nesara, all that, please), as they trigger me rn.

 When do people think things will start to "go back to normal"? Most people seem to be under the impression that things will start to reopen within the next few weeks and that this will all just last for a couple months. But I cant see schools, business and other public spaces being open anytime soon, let alone the virus just stopping. I feel like it will continue to mutate and grow and spread for several months and that's why its so frustrating to see friends of mine still hanging out and not taking this seriously. Anyways, what do you guys think?

 For those that have flown back to Canada what was your experience? Hello,

I am in Asia in a country that barely has any cases.  I been delaying my trip home as much as possible since March but next month my visa options are gone so I have no choice but to hop on a plane and head back to Canada.  Of course I will be doing the precautions of Mask, Googles, washing hands, cleaning areas, staying away from others as much as  I can etc and do have a place to stay under quarantine for 14 days when I arrive.  


I will be flying into Montreal or Toronto and then taking a domestic flight home to my city

1. What has been your experience when you landed?
2. Is there anything I should do to make things easier
3. What happens (hopefully not) if I land in Montreal and have a fever, am I zipped away to some quarantine location or do they even check before i get on my second flight?
4. how safe did u feel on your travels?

I can tell you I do not want to fly home but soon it will be staying illegally in a foreign country or getting back home and facing Covid quarantine, both choices are not exactly fun times , my initial plan was to fly back in March of 2020 but that time it was really bad and pushed my time farther ahead hoping things would settle down.  I would love to stay where I am right not, even for another year but the VISA to stay is the problem, exhausted all my options

 Father is 72 and has COPD, to stay in Florida or come back to Canada ? I'm guessing he should come back... Just wondering what you think. Is he better off staying there for the next few months or coming back here to self isolate at home ?
