 Headache for almost 2 weeks. Should I get tested? On Friday 12 I developed a bad sore throat, cough and headache. I was in bed for 7 days. Now everything is gone except my horrible headache. Should I get tested? I don’t think I have the virus but my manager is telling me I have to go before I can come back to work. I don’t want to get tested because if I don’t want to catch the virus from someone at the clinic.

 Getting an antibody test in Canada Does anyone have any experience getting an antibody test in Canada? In the US and UK, you can just pay for one. I'd be willing to do so, if the price was right. I had a bit of weird (though fairly mild) symptoms back in January, and I'd to know if it was COVID or not.

 Do I bother getting tested for covid-19? My workplace got hit with 2 cases of covid-19 and I am unsure if it worth it to get tested. I want to get tested, but I am given no clear timeline when my results will come in. I could miss 2 days of work or a week waiting for my results. If I do get tested, I am not getting paid despite it coming from work.

So far all my coworkers that volunteered to get tested have tested negative.   I don't have any symptoms and I haven't worked directly with the two that tested positive.

 Italian Health Service has just confirmed that 95% of positive Covid test-results in Italy are false positives, and a legal case has been launched "under charges of fraud to procure public funding, false alarm, ideological false (sic), and manslaughter". (original is in Italian) Apparently the Italian Health Service has just confirmed that 95% of positive Covid test-results in Italy are false positives, and a legal case has been launched "under charges of fraud to procure public funding, false alarm, ideological false (sic), and manslaughter". An Italian Nobel Prize Candidate from 2018 has weighed in to confirm that the Covid19 tests are fraudulent, and that "there is more to this than false positives." "Stefano Scoglio says: swabs look for 3 genes characterizing SARS-CoV-2. "If the virus were present, all 3 would have to be found, because if the virus is intact, the only case in which it can have a pathogenic role &amp; infect, the test must find all 3 genes"". But the results of PCR tests in Italy now clearly state  that since April, "in agreement with the regional coordinating center, the detection of even a single SARS-CoV-2 target gene is interpreted as a POSITIVE test" (see image below). Even though such a test actually proves the person is in fact negative for covid.  

I wonder if Canada and the US area are also following this fraudulent protocol. It would explain why there seem to be so many "asyptomatic" cases. 

Here's the thread on Twitter:

 Where can I get COVID19 serological test (antibody test) in Toronto? Hi,

I am looking for Covid-19 serological test (antibody test) in Toronto.

Some countries like my home countries require us to get tested to enter. 

I know 'Medcan' will provide the test from August. 

I wonder there are other options.

 Any false negative covid tests? I had a negative test but symptoms dead on with covid. Recently had dry cough and fever for 2 weeks. Cough not that bad. Also chest pain, weakness, etc. No runny nose, no real sore throat so not like typical influenza. Went to hospital wearing a mask and washed my hands on entry. 

They gave me covid test and influenza test. Mind you at this point I was on the mend. Covid came back negative next day, and I believe influenza negative as well. Now let me say this "bug" was unlike anything I experienced before. I have never had a 2 week fever in my life. I really only felt lousy and not that bad for a few days, but the tightness and pain in the chest was concerning me. The weakness has lingered still but slowly improving. I did stay inside for the 2 weeks. They checked my lungs with xray and said fine. 

I found the nurse doing the test very gentle and only put the nasal swab in quickly--no turning, swirl, etc. It was quick in and out in like 2 seconds for both influenza and covid swabs. What do you all think?

 Can I walk into a Toronto hospital (like Toronto General Hospital) and get tested if I have mild symptoms? I’ve had a sore throat and a cough for 5 days now. It’s not getting better. Now it feels like my chest is also infected. But I haven’t had the fever or runny nose or aches. I’ve never had a flu/cold like this. And sore throats go away in 2 days for me. 

I am also a student at uoft and since uni closed I want to go back home to my parents (who live 3 hrs away) but my dad has heart problems I can’t risk bringing the virus to him. I had been going to uni up till today and we have a huge student body with lots of internationals. I could have been exposed.

 I feel like Carona has already spread to thousands in Canada but for most people it’s just a cold. My family all got sick last week,  my kids and wife all got a fever and sore throat.  I didn’t really get a fever but did have a wickedly sore throat for two days and now have a cough.  My best friend who lives in Vancouver said his family all had the same flu last week they all still have a cough.

My co workers were both home sick for 4 days with the flu last week as well. They seemed to have it quite bad even though they were in there twenties.

I have tried calling 811 to see if I can get tested but it’s busy.  I wish it was easier for anyone with a sore throat and fever to get tested.  

This might just be the flu but if it’s the corona then I think it’s already everywhere.  Especially with family’s like ours that had kids in school.

I also do wonder if they fatality rate is a lot lower than the WTO says because so many people had mild cold like symptoms like ours so are not part of the stats.

I think South Korea is the only country that tests everyone.

 Do I need to self isolate while waiting for results with no symptoms? I'm in Ottawa and was just tested. I don't have any symptoms although over the weekend I was outdoors at the same picnic table as someone who tested positive (they found out Tuesday, had no symptoms, and were only tested because they had close contact with someone 16 days prior who recently tested positive).

When I went to get tested they only asked if I was part of an outbreak and if I had any symptoms, when I answered no to both of those they performed the test and did not give me any further instructions besides that I will hear back about my results in 5 to 7 days.

Do I need to self isolate until I get my results? I feel like the chances of me having caught it are pretty low, and I'm not even sure I would consider it close contact (outdoors the entire time, opposite ends of a picnic table for only a short while, windy day, the person had no symptoms and had caught the virus 16 days prior and did not know).

 We created a COVID-19 antibody test interpreter  Dear r/CanadaCoronavirus,

I’m sure a lot of you have seen all of the news articles recently about how COVID-19 antibody testing doesn’t actually tell you much even if they claim to be very accurate. Well, we have decided to create a [site]( that helps anyone interpret their results in a more meaningful way. All you have to do is enter a couple of statistics from the specific test you took and you will instantly be able to see what your test results really mean.

We also try to give a more intuitive explanation for the incredibly unintuitive results which arise out of COVID-19 antibody tests.

If you have taken an antibody test or just want to learn a bit more on what testing accuracy really means, please check out [our site]( and let us know what you think.

Thanks, [the Covid Test Interpreter Team]( (CTIT)

 What "mild" means You often hear "80% of cases are mild", but what does that mean? How sick will you be if you have a mild case of COVID-19?

Please correct me if I'm wrong, but from what I can tell, it comes from this report from China: [

&gt;Among confirmed cases, most were aged 30–79 years (86.6%), diagnosed in Hubei (74.7%), and considered **mild (80.9%)**.

How do they define mild?

&gt;The severity of symptoms variable was categorized as mild, severe, or critical. **Mild included non-pneumonia and mild pneumonia cases.** Severe was characterized by dyspnea, respiratory frequency ≥30/minute, blood oxygen saturation ≤93%, PaO2/FiO2 ratio &lt;300, and/or lung infiltrates &gt;50% within 24–48 hours. Critical cases were those that exhibited respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure.

Now, I can't speak for you, but for me, I have never had an acute condition on the level of mild pneumonia. So, **I could have a "mild" case of COVID-19 and yet be the sickest I've been in my entire life**. I believe this is probably true for a lot of people.

Is this reason to panic, no, you become very sick but you get through it. It's not a death sentence (like the disease in Contagion, for example). But it is a reason to take COVID-19 seriously and not just wave it away like it's nothing.

 Tests in Canada vs Tests in USA - Similarities and Differences The false negatives, releasing patients who were later found positive, and the lack of testing are all concerns in the USA. 

I have seen that we are doing more tests here in Canada than the USA:

"The B.C. Centre for Disease Control (BC CDC) reported that it has tested 1,012 people for the virus as of Feb. 27, 2020."


"Theresa Tam, Canada’s Chief Public Health Officer, said that some provinces, particularly B.C. and Ontario, are starting to test a wider sample of the population to detect possible community spread of the virus, including those who go to the hospital with flu-like symptoms even if they haven’t travelled outside of Canada recently."


However, I haven't found much information about how the actual tests we do here in Canada differ from the ones in the USA. 
What do we know so far about the test itself? How are our tests (the actual tests, not the testing proess itself although that is important too) similar or different from the tests in the USA? Should we also be concerned about false positives? Please include links where possible.

 Testing Requirements? Alberta isn't testing anyone unless they have travelled or come into contact with someone or have shortness of breath while resting or worse; Symptoms listed by WHO:

 People may experience:  

* Runny nose
* Sore throat
* Cough
* Fever
* Difficulty breathing (severe cases)

So.. they're only testing severe cases?! I've been sick for a while now, longer than usual, could be it, don't know, can't get tested because while my lungs feel crappy and are congested I am just barely at the threshold where I would say I'm 'short of breath while resting'; according to WHO it could be a not severe case, according to AHS, " There are many common viruses other than COVID-19 that can cause your  symptoms. Based on your responses you do not need to be tested for  COVID-19 at this time. "

Shouldn't we be testing anyone with symptoms? I've read so many things that say testing is the key..?

Or are we just going to lock everyone inside until it goes away?

Thoughts?

 Expanding NS testing: "We're up for the challenge" THIS is how public health officials gain community trust (Dr. Tam take note): being upfront and honest (See last quoted paragraphs). 

I am *for the most part* incredibly proud at Nova Scotia's response. We have enough PPE to handle the uptick in cases so far, we are expanding testing and lab capacity like crazy, and the government is learning how to communicate what is important to people. Our numbers would be a lot worse were it not for Dr. Strang's wisdom and guidance. 

[

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The government says it has also expanded the list of symptoms being screened for COVID-19. They are:  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Fever.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- New or worsening cough.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Sore throat.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Runny nose.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Headache.  
&gt;  
&gt;If you have two or more of those symptoms, visit [811's website]( to determine if you should call 811 for further assessment.  
&gt;  
&gt;With the expanded testing, Strang assured 811 has enough people in its assessment centres to handle the requests.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;"Quite frankly, they said to me, 'We're up for the challenge of  testing as many Nova Scotians in this as necessary,'" Strang said.  
&gt;  
&gt;He said testing is a key part of the strategy to minimize the spread of COVID-19.  
&gt;  
&gt;Strang said the number of cases appearing in Nova Scotia is because of the province's testing strategy.  
&gt;  
&gt;"I really firmly believe that we have a very kind of gold standard of a testing strategy," Strang said.   
&gt;  
&gt;"We  have lab capacity, we've opened up access and now we're looking for it  in our in Nova Scotia communities in a very aggressive way."  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;Strang said while there is evidence of community spread, it's  not widespread, except in communities that were singled out on Tuesday:  Enfield, Cherry Brook, East Preston and North Preston.  
&gt;  
&gt;"And  that's not a reflection of those communities, it's just an honest,  truthful reflection of where this is an active disease within a part of  our province," Strang said.

 I'm confused how there's a shortage of test? Is it not just a swab that's sent to a lab and then tested? Wouldn't it be similar to blood test and even flu tests? And how are places like Germany and south Korea able to test thousands a day and we cant seem to do enough to even test anyone with symptoms.

I'm so confused here. Why are we failing at testing enough people to get this fully under control?

 Are you able to get tested in Ontario if you have symptoms? I was tested in late March and it was extremely difficult. Since tests have been ramping up, what's what you heard about getting tested if you would like to? I just want to know whether is easily accessible these days or not. I know this sub is for quality discussions but I would like to know your experience. I'm in a small community and we were told that everybody with symptoms can get tested. I was tested in late March because I had symptoms and my test ended up being negative. Back then, it was extremely difficult to get tested but I had close contact with someone who tested positive, so I was allowed to get tested. What's the situation now? The news don't seem to cover stories of people being rejected so I tend to think we are doing well.

 Let’s recollect all users with presumptive symptoms of Covid-19 since we can’t get tested. I’m from Toronto currently up north in a cabin. I was in Picton ON last weekend and visited the store there. People coughing all over the place. If I got it, it must be from there because I was previously in isolation for 2 weeks. 

Currently experience mild symptoms and a bit anxious about what’s going to happen in the next days.

 COVID procedures Now that schools are starting across Canada, I anticpiate cases will go up. Also, with the arrival of fall, allergies, colds and regular flu, lot of people will be symptomatic.  I have red thru government self assemsent tool and pages, but i find the info still confusing.  What are the procedures in these cases:

1. Someone you've been in contact with in last 2 weeks develops a non COVID symptoms.  Ie. Sniffles, low grade fever (37), etc.

2. Someone you've been in contact with in last 2 weeks develops a COVID symptoms, but hasn't been tested positive (or tested inconclusive, or negative).  Ie. Cough,  fever 38, etc.

3. Someone you've been in contact with in last 2 weeks develops a COVID symptoms, and tested positive.

Specifically recommendations about, self isolation, getting tested, notifying anyone you've been in contact for extened oftime, etc. This is all assuming you haven't travelled anywhere, and people you've been in contact haven't travelled anywhere outside of country.

 Mild symptoms, labored breathing, stuck at home with no answers I had a mild fever Sunday and Monday with labored breathing, and my husband had the same symptoms a couple days after me. I got the flu shot this year so (unless the flu shot is terrible) I can rule out a seasonal flu. While most of my symptoms are gone, I'm still having labored breathing today and a lot of exhaustion. I didn't want to believe it was the coronavirus but my partner and I are starting to think we might have it, because of the breathing. Neither of us have asthma or any prior breathing issues. We're both in our 30's. Opinions? Is anyone else experiencing mild symptoms of covid and are stuck in limbo wondering if it's true or not?

We're definitely too mild to get tested but we are still quarantining, of course.

 Should I watch myself for symptoms and get myself tested? Hi guys,

I am wondering if I should get myself tested? Today the mailman came (mid 50's wasn't sick), and I had to sign a package for my dad because it came through customs- I was holding my breath the entire time and tried to maintain a distance. The door was open and the air was quite windy and cold and the mailman spoke briefly. Should I be paranoid about the mailman?

I also had to go to my grocery store on Monday and the pharmacy but I wore an N95 Mask with a neck scarf over it to protect myself. Should I go ahead and get tested for COVID-19 and be aware for any symptoms?

 COVID-19 disease / SARS-CoV-2 infection / Coronavirus infection: Timeline of Symptoms, What to Do, When to Get Tested, When to Visit Hospital and When to Start Normal Activities **I. COMMON SYMPTOMS of COVID-19** (you might have one or more of these)

**I.A. Symptoms in MILD CASES** \- If you have only these, then you DO NOT need hospitalisation

1. Gastrointestinal symptoms - diarrhoea
2. Loss of sense of smell
3. Loss of taste
4. Mild fever
5. Cough
6. Tiredness
7. Body ache
8. Runny nose
9. Sore throat
10. Nasal congestion
11. Red eye (whites of eye become red)
12. Headache

**I.B. Additionals Symptoms that are present ONLY in SERIOUS CASES** \- If you have any of these then you NEED hospitalisation WARNING: These symptoms indicate that you might need to be hospitalised immediately. You MUST visit the nearest hospital WITHOUT DELAY as soon as you experience any of these symptoms.

1. High fever
2. Continuous cough
3. Difficulty breathing
4. Mental disorientation or confusion
5. Coughing up blood

**II. DISEASE PRESENTATION** (you can be Asymptomatic, that is not have any symptoms or Symptomatic, that is have one or more symptoms)

**II.A. ASYMPTOMATIC CASES**

People who do not exhibit any symptoms and don't feel unwell even after being infected.

Different studies show that the proportion of asymptomatic cases may be somewhere between 25 % to 50%

What to do: All those who do not have any symptoms should take the following precautions

1. Self-isolate - stay at home and go out only when urgently needed to buy essential supplies.
2. Wear masks - always wear a mask while going out. In case N95 and surgical masks are not available, then make masks at home from household materials. Instructional videos for DIY masks are easily available online. Homemade masks are also at least 50% as effective as surgical masks and their efficacy can go up to that of surgical masks by using the right design and materials. In case you have vulnerable people staying at home then those going outside should also wear masks inside the house. Before using masks, learn how to use them properly. Instructional videos are easily available online. Do not use masks with vents because if you are infected then they do not provide any protection to others.
3. Practice good hand hygiene - Do not touch your mouth, nose, or eyes before washing or sanitizing your hand. Hands should be washed at least for 20 seconds. Instructional videos for proper hand washing can be easily found online. As much as possible avoid touching surfaces when you go out. Use hands sanitizers liberally to sanitize your hand after you touch any surface outside.
4. Practice physical/social distancing -  Try to stay at least six feet away from others when you go out.
5. Do not worry - Worrying will lead to stress and lower your immunity. Take all the precautions possible and it will minimise your chances of getting infected by as much as 90%.

**II.B. SYMPTOMATIC CASES**

People who exhibit one or more symptoms following infection.

**II.B.1. MILD DISEASE**: About 95% of symptomatic cases experience a MILD disease. They experience a mild FLU like condition and DO NOT need hospitalization. You will have one or more of the symptoms listed under "IA. Symptoms in MILD CASES" mentioned above.

DAY 1-6: You will have one or more of the symptoms listed under "I.A. Symptoms in MILD CASES" (above). DAY 7: You will either start feeling better DAY 8: Feeling better - You need not worry. Your body is successfully controlling the virus. DAY 9 Onwards: Fully recovered - Your body has successfully controlled the virus. A dry cough might persist for as many as 14 days after full recovery.

DAYS 1-10 AFTER FULL RECOVERY: You may continue to SHED the virus for as long as 08 DAYS after full recovery. Therefore, continue to follow all precautions as if you are still infected BOTH inside the house and while going outside for AT LEAST another 10 DAYS after becoming all right. DAY 11 ONWARDS AFTER FULL RECOVERY: You can return to your normal activities.

IMMUNITY: All fully recovered cases become immune to the infection and remain so for a long period of time (for months - although information about how long immunity lasts is still lacking because it is a newly emerging disease so adequate data is not available). Fully recovered cases can go out and HELP run essential services.

**II.B.2. SERIOUS DISEASE**: About 5% of symptomatic cases will experience a SERIOUS disease. These cases WILL need hospital care.

DAY 1-6: You will have one or more of the symptoms listed under "I.A. Symptoms in MILD CASES" (above). DAY 1-6: You may also start expereincing one or more of the symptoms listed under "I.B. Symptoms in SERIOUS CASES" (above). IF YOU HAVE ANY OF THESE SYMPTOMS THEN YOU SHOULD REPORT TO A HOSPITAL IMMEDIATELY.

DAY 7 Onwards: If you had only mild symptoms earlier, you migh start feeling worse or start experiencing one of the symptoms of the serious cases - You should IMMEDIATELY go to the nearest hospital to be tested.

**III. REQUIREMENT OF HEALTHCARE FACILITIES**

95% of those infected need 2 weeks to recover without any medicine; 5% of those infected need hospitalisation; 2% of those infected need ICU care; and 1% of those infected need ventilator support.

 Government refusing testing My girlfriend has begun to show symptoms of Covid-19. She called the hotline at 811 and after 2 hours on hold was told to self-isolate but refused a test. They said they will not test anyone unless they have been in close contact with someone who tested positive. when asked what "close contact" means she was told that someone in your household or your physician is what they consider close contact. Just to be clear, unless you live with someone who has tested positive they will not test you, so people in your household can only be tested if people in your household have been tested. It's a definition catch 22. Furthermore, when asked if \*I\* should continue going to work she was told that yes I should go to work until I show symptoms. If she is positive, I am positive and could be contagious without symptoms for some time. I am incredibly saddened by the incompetence of our government. They should have shut everything down yesterday, how many more people will be infected before we close down all non-esential services and mandate isolation?

 Where are we with antibody tests being available in Canada ? One of the most crucial aspects is testing everyone, and especially antibody tests to see who has had the virus, anti body tests can even be done at home technically, where are we in Canada with this ?

 Please tell me if you think I'm crazy to be wondering about this I've been following this since the news broke, I have an autoimmune condition and travel a lot.   I flew to Hawaii Dec 28th and had time to start learning while away on holidays.  My flight was via Maui to Big Island for 3 weeks ish, felt great while there.  Upon returning home Jan 22 (when extra screening was supposed to be happening, but I noted nothing different) 2 days later I was ill.  It was a redeye flight home, I had 2 extra seats beside me and was so excited to sleep, I didn't put my mask on as usual.  

I work for myself so stayed home and kept googling for info on the differences between a flu &amp; covid-19.  My symptoms were dry cough, nothing in my sinuses, fever, exhausted, and very achy, near the end a sore throat which I mostly attributed to the dry hacking cough, and then there was finally phlegm at about day 10, the cough continued for 3 weeks.   It was the worst flu I've ever had by far.

At the time, the symptoms we were being told about definitely excluded the achy body and sniffles that some are now reporting.  I was calling it a flu, didn't go to docs or anything, just stayed home.  Now that we are aware that the US completely dropped the ball on testing, and that Japan had it's first case Jan 16th and has multiple direct flights to Maui in a day, I'm really wishing there was an antibody test.  

Here's the other thing, the meds I take for the autoimmune condition are hydroxychloroquine, which have been in clinical trails as a possible treatment for covid-19.  

Am I nuts to be wondering if I could have already had the virus?  Has anyone seen anything about antibody tests for this?
