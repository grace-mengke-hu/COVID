 To safely refuse a mask, could you just set it aside? So with coronavirus virus supposedly becoming harmless or "dying" on cardboard after 24 hours and plastics after 72 ( - would just setting the mask aside for a few days render it safe to use again? I get that in a health care setting this would likely be inadequate because of viral load but what about private or non-medical settings?

Sorry if this has been asked before.

 Shopping at T&amp;T with mandatory masking policy Last night I shopped at the T&amp;T grocery store in Waterloo. If you aren't familiar with T&amp;T they are a Chinese grocery chain with stores across Canada and they have a mandatory masking policy. 

To enter the store, you had to have on a mask, submit to a temperature check and sanitize your hands. It was not optional. Outside the store in the lineup to get in, two people did not have masks and they were informed they had to have on a mask. The male started to complain but the female with him told to be quiet and went to their car and got masks for them both. Surgical masks were available for sale for $1.00 at the door. 

Inside the store, everybody was wearing their masks properly. I saw nobody pulling down their masks to talk and I saw no noses sticking out of masks. Social distancing was maintained as much as possible. The aisles were narrow but people were not crowding and were passing each other as quickly as reasonable. 

Most of the customers were Asian so I think that they have much better awareness of proper masking than Westerners. My takeaway is that the with proper education people will wear masks properly. They don't get reckless and disregard social distancing.

I felt very safe shopping there. I didn't have to worry about somebody sneezing in their hand in the parking lot and handling the produce. I didn't have to worry about somebody coughing or sneezing and leaving a cloud of viral particles hanging in the air inside the store. I didn't have to worry when people accidentally or unavoidably got too close.

I am an advocate of masking and what I saw last night convinces me that a sane, well thought out masking policy can be easily implemented and presents no serious difficulties for adherence.

 I just went to donate blood. I was told I was not allowed to wear a mask as it was a place of wellness and they were asking if people had travelled. Had an appointment, I'm healthy at the moment so figured I'd donate. Had a paper mask on, it being Ter than nothing. I was told they won't accept anyone with gloves or masks as it's a place of wellness and their screener asked if you felt sick or have traveled. That's it. 

I left. I was willing to put myself at risk to donate but fuck that.
