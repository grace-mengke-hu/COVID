 Letter to North Van families - Lynn Valley care centre cases Dear Parents/Guardians and Staff,
Subject: Confirmation of COVID-19 cases at Lynn Valley Care Centre (long-term care facility)
As you are likely aware, the Provincial Health Officer announced three confirmed cases of COVID-19 at the Lynn Valley Care Centre, located at 1070 Lynn Valley Road. This information has understandably increased the concern and anxiety amongst members of our school community. We continue to work closely with Vancouver Coastal Health to keep our community informed about any risk associated with these cases.

Vancouver Coastal Health has confirmed that any care home staff who have potentially been exposed have been identified, instructed to isolate at home and asked to monitor for symptoms. Care home staff without known exposures may continue working and there are no restrictions on the family members of any staff (exposed or unexposed). If staff develop symptoms, they will be tested. If they test positive, they will be isolated along with their family members.

Our efforts to help reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19 with increased cleaning and disinfecting of high-touch surfaces will continue. We are also considering further measures for the coming week and the weeks following Spring Break.  Most importantly, we ask that you stay home if you or your family are sick.

 COVID-19 in long-term care homes in Ontario and British Columbia Key Points:
• Many more residents living in Ontario long-term care homes have died from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) than in British Columbia.
• During the first wave of the pandemic, British Columbia was faster than Ontario in responding to COVID-19, with actions to address public health support, staffing, and infection prevention and control.
• Leaders in British Columbia were more decisive, coordinated and consistent in their overall communication and response.
• Before the pandemic, the long-term care system in British Columbia exhibited a number of potential strengths relevant to pandemic preparedness compared with Ontario: there was better coordination between long-term care, public health and hospitals; greater funding of long-term care; more care hours for residents; fewer shared rooms; more nonprofit facility ownership; and more comprehensive inspections.

 COVID Mental Health Survey **PARTICIPANTS NEEDED FOR STUDY**

How do this **global pandemic** and consequent **social isolation** affect our **mental health**? 

Professor Ian Gold and other researchers at the Neurophilosophy lab are conducting a study on mental health and beliefs during the COVID-19 pandemic. We are interested in how different **beliefs and attitudes towards COVID19** (including degree of trust in the government and believing so-called conspiracy theories) impact mental health and cognition. The study will take approximately **25 minutes**, and will be conducted online and will be offered in English. You will be asked to answer a series of questions about your experiences, feelings, and beliefs, especially with regard to the COVID-19 pandemic and the related social isolation. By participating, you help researchers better understand the scope of people's beliefs, attitudes and opinions throughout this crisis, and how they may relate to mental health.

Your participation is completely ANONYMOUS. If you are interested in participating, click on this link: [ which will take you to the survey. If you have any questions, please send us a Direct Message or contact us at neurophilosophylabmcgill@gmail.com. DO NOT REPLY directly to this ad.

 Public Health Lessons Learned From Biases in Coronavirus Mortality Overestimation Abstract:

In testimony before  US Congress on March 11, 2020, members of the House Oversight and  Reform Committee were informed that estimated mortality for the novel  coronavirus was 10-times higher than for seasonal influenza. Additional  evidence, however, suggests the validity of this estimation could  benefit from vetting for biases and miscalculations. The main objective  of this article is to critically appraise the coronavirus mortality  estimation presented to Congress. Informational texts from the World  Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  are compared with coronavirus mortality calculations in Congressional  testimony. Results of this critical appraisal reveal information bias  and selection bias in coronavirus mortality overestimation, most likely  caused by misclassifying an influenza infection fatality rate as a case  fatality rate. Public health lessons learned for future infectious  disease pandemics include: safeguarding against research biases that may  underestimate or overestimate an associated risk of disease and  mortality; reassessing the ethics of fear-based public health campaigns;  and providing full public disclosure of adverse effects from severe  mitigation measures to contain viral transmission.

 COVID-19 Test Counts by Province &amp; Territory I followed the links in the pinned post and attempted to find the total number of tests performed in every province and territory, along with the results. Unfortunately I couldn't find any test counts for Newfoundland, PEI, Quebec, Nunavut, or the Yukon, although NL, PEI, and Nunavut do say they have no confirmed cases. Also my French is very rusty and I couldn't find the English-language COVID page for Quebec, so the confirmed cases for Quebec are from Public Health Canada. If you find an official source that fills in any of the blanks please comment with a link and I'll update this post. Otherwise my current plan is to check and update once a day.

A challenge with compiling and comparing these numbers is that every website has a slightly different system for reporting. The biggest variation is whether they count individual tests or persons tested or both; I've used persons when possible. Another is that BC includes recovered cases in the confirmed case counts (as does Public Health Canada), while Ontario excludes them. I've changed Ontario to match BC. If you find any other ambiguities or mismatches or have any suggestions, please comment.

 News release

February 9, 2020 - Ottawa, Ontario - Global Affairs Canada

Canada is working with its partners and international organizations to control the spread of the novel coronavirus. This is vital to helping those affected and protecting the health and safety of people around the world.

To support China’s ongoing response to the outbreak, Canada has deployed approximately 16 tonnes of personal protective equipment, such as clothing, face shields, masks, goggles and gloves to the country since February 4, 2020. 

This equipment has been provided in collaboration with the Canadian Red Cross and the Red Cross Society of China.

&amp;#x200B;

The health and safety of all Canadians is our top priority.

PHAC is working with provinces, territories and international partners, including the World Health Organization, to actively monitor the situation. Global efforts are focused on containment of the outbreak in China and the prevention of further spread.

Canada's Chief Public Health Officer of Canada is in close contact with provincial and territorial Chief Medical Officers of Health to ensure that any cases of COVID-19 occurring in Canada continue to be rapidly identified and managed in order to protect the health of Canadians.

Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory has implemented testing to diagnose COVID-19 from clinical specimens. The laboratory is working collaboratively with Canadian provincial public health laboratories to ensure there is additional testing capacity in multiple jurisdictions.

**As of February 25, 2020, British Columbia and Ontario are able to confirm laboratory diagnostics for the virus that causes COVID-19. For all other provinces, their results undergo additional testing at the National Microbiology Laboratory to provide further confirmation of initial laboratory findings. Please refer to information from provinces and territories for further test result summaries.**

As of March 2, 2020, the National Microbiology Laboratory has confirmed 506 negative cases and 14 positive cases of COVID-19.

 Those who believe the public is taking mask supply away from health care workers? From where do you believe this is happening? There are no masks being taken from health care workers sources. One off a shelf from a Walmart isn’t going to make a dent.

People are making masks, ordering from overseas, and using non NIOSH masks that the Govt wouldn’t approve for health care worker use anyways. 

It’s become a moot argument/point to make about people taking masks from health workers.

Now, at this point, anyone who finds a way to cover their airways is doing a service to healthcare by stopping infection.

If you see someone wearing a mask, thank them for doing their part. 

If you see someone not covering their face, tell them to cover their face. They are the problem. Those people are who are spreading

 What are some of the impacts of Covid-19 on your industry that most people outside the industry wouldn't know or think about? I've seen a few posts from farmers, educators and health care workers, and spoken with friends and family about some of the impacts to their jobs or industries. It has made me curious what some of the lesser known impacts are across these and other industries. 

If really love to hear from people across a wide variety of industries - farming, manufacturing, trades, energy, retail, commerce, finance, forestry, education, tech, business... You name it! 

If you're able, it would also be interesting to hear your take on what can or should be done to address those impacts. And if you're comfortable, share what your role is in that industry (corporate exec, small business owner, management, journeyman, labourer, admin...)

Very helpful to understand how these public health measures can impact the disease and why they're so important. Without interventions they estimate 100k deaths. And depending on the next set of public health measures, approximately 3,000 to 15,000 deaths. So far, they believe that 4,400 deaths will have been spared by the end of the month by the actions taken to date. As they've been saying from the start, the success of these measures will depend on how well they're followed. Here's the presentation: [

 Canadian Pandemic Influenza Preparedness: Planning Guidance for the Health Sector There has been significant discussion surrounding Canada's Pandemic planning, preparedness and standards.  For reference, this is Canada's current [Pandemic Influenza Preparedness: Planning Guidance for the Health Sector.](

It was developed in 2006 after the SARS inquiry and updated after MERS and H1N1.

These are detailed steps, measures and contingencies for Federal, Provincial and Municipal governments and public health authorities. 

For the most part, Canada is not following this Pandemic Plan because the Federal Government has not declared an emergency.   [Step 1 of this plan was never taken.](

*Planning for a prolonged and widespread health emergency of  unpredictable impact is challenging but essential. It requires a “whole  of society” response and the coordinated efforts of all levels of  government in collaboration with their stakeholders.*  

Many of us are struggling to understand why Canada finds itself facing new restrictions and wanting to know there is light at the end of the tunnel.  If you want to know why a measures is mandatory or optional, or what options exist for reopening, this is the gold standard.

 COVID-19 Assessment Centre(s) planning for the Kitchener-Waterloo-Wellesley-Wilmot-Woolich region Just got an email regarding the planning of COVID-19 testing centres. Here are some excerpts from the email:

"The Primary Care Council for the KW4 OHT met on the evening of March 11, 2020. We hosted Dr. Julie Emili from Public Health who is helping our region with our COVID-19 Screening and setting up our COVID-19 Assessment Centres. Our Region is working hard on a plan led by the hospitals, however, she has requested help. We are in need of ideas for Assessment Centre locations &amp; Volunteers to work in them..."

"VOLUNTEERS:
• We are asking for volunteers, for any health care professional who is interested in helping in the COVID-19 Assessment Centres.  
• We currently do not know which type of individuals are needed, so we ask that you forward this around to those in the Kitchener-Waterloo-Wellesley-Wilmot-Woolich area who are interested in helping, and Public Health will contact you with further details. 
• You will be provided with personal protective equipment (PPE), which when used appropriately will protect you.
• You will be able to work safely from your clinic while you help in the assessment centre."

"LOCATIONS:
• We are looking for suggestions as to where to locate assessment centres.  
• Even if you have sent suggestions to someone, please list them again.
• The request is to have a reception area, a sink (in or outside exam rooms) and a door to the rooms where patients are being assessed."

"On behalf of Public Health, we are currently creating a list with as many people who are willing to help. This includes PAs, NPs, Midwives, MOAs, RPNs, RNs, Receptionists, etc"
