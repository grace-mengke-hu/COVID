 In light of Canada &amp; US starting to ease restrictions, I put together some graphs of recent trends showing how each country is doing compared to the other - May 14, 2020 **US VS Canada - May 14, 2020**

I put together some graphs to see how we are doing in recent trends compared to our neighbors down south, who are also opening around the same time as us. 

--- 

[DAILY CASES per million ](

- Canada = 30/million

- US = 60/million

The US was hovering between 80-100 daily cases per million, whereas Canada has been between 30-40 daily cases per million.

---

[DAILY DEATHS per million](

- Canada = 4.06 /million

- US = 4.62 /million

The daily death numbers per capita for the US are down from a pretty recent peak of 7-8 deaths per million, which is nearly double vs Canada who's been hovering around 4 more consistently. 

---

[TOTAL TESTS per thousand](

- Canada = 30.94 /thousand

- US = 30.14 /thousand

[DAILY DEATHS per thousand over the last week](

Looking at *total* tests per capita highlights that both countries are similar. 

Looking at *daily* tests suggests Canada is actually testing less per capita. 

*This will become relevant very soon*

---

[POSITIVE TEST RATE over the last week](

- Canada = 1.3%-6.7% range (average about 5%)

- US = 6.2%-18-9% (average about 14%)

This is probably the most telling graphs of them all. 

When testing for a suspected disease, you generally have criteria or a certain pretest probability (clinical suspicion based on symptoms and presumed prevalence/incidence and risk factors, etc) that you consider when administering diagnostic tests.

If your POSITIVE TEST RATE is HIGH compared to a country with overall similar population characteristics, location etc (and if both countries are isolated in that there is currently limited spread between the countries), then you know that the disease incidence and prevalence is much worse than the country with the lower positive rate. 

Since the Americans are testing more than Canadians over the last week, and their POSITIVE TEST RATE is way HIGHER than Canada's, it means that the US are still vastly under testing and therefore have a much higher true prevalence and incidence than us. 

Ideally the US should have a MUCH HIGHER test per capita rate than Canada to lower their positive test rate to be closer to ours in order to know they are on the right (or similar) track.

---
**In Summary**

Recently, the US has roughly double the cases per capita than Canada, and while the recent death rate of the US is now similar to ours, it was almost double not too long ago. This is in context of the US having similar testing rates overall (or slightly more this week), with a vastly higher positive test rate. 

**Commentary** 

This sugges that their actual true prevalence and incidence is MUCH higher than the confirmed case rate above (and therefore much more than just double Canada's new case rate). 

Why would the US reopen with still worse numbers than Canada and no consistent flattening, yet Canada is taking it much slower? 

Maybe we should keep that border shut for the time being...? Looking forward to your comments.
