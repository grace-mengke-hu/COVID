 What’s the projected outlook on quarantines and such What’s the best outlook really and what are projected on
++++++++++
 Alarming Time I honestly believe we need to isolate everyone as soon as possible . The statistics of 80% chance of survival is currently wrong and if you take out China and Iran, survival is at 65%.  Canada is 50/50 in recovery/death  as I am posting this.

Statistically,  this is getting worse and worse . The site following the virus even stopped producing death per day ratio because the jumps started getting ridiculous. 

Now the scary reality for us Canadians, there will be thousands and thousands of people infected and hundreds, perhaps even thousands will succumb to this epidemic . 
Us Canadians need to pull together (seperately) and make this number the lowest it could be. Everybody is at risk and we know who are the most at risk. Isolation should be mandatory. 

Prediction wise, our neighbours down South are going to probably get hit the hardest, the cases coming up are increasing by the hour. The worse has yet to come and they seem to already be in a little bit of trouble.

As for China, nobody will be able to do what they did to fight this virus. They built 2 giant facilities just for the virus patients to all be in one spot and as far away from people. They literally went door to door to test people to make sure nobody had the virus. This is how dangerous this virus is. You need to be two steps ahead of it to beat it.

All the best to everyone,  be smart.  Stock up asap and do your part of just isolating yourself, loved ones and protect yourselves. This virus can potentially change the whole world. It is time we all take action.

 Journalist looking to speak with Canadians currently quarantined at home in Canada Hi there, I'm a Canadian freelance journalist working for a large, mainstream Canadian newspaper. 
This is me:


I'm currently working on a story about what it's like to be quarantined at home. I'd like to speak by phone with anyone who is currently self-quarantined at home. 

This is my email: liagrainger@gmail.com

Thank you, and stay safe.

 Can anyone recommend a reputable seller on Etsy/somewhere else to buy hand sewn facemasks? After visiting the grocery store today, and seeing how people simply are not following distancing guidelines despite all the warnings and tape on the floor (I even saw some people openly coughing and stopping to chat), I have decided that some protection is better than no protection. I can't sew. Is anyone able to point me to a link where I could buy hand sewn facemasks?

 Canadian health and transport officials are too kind and gentle For something as important as this *requesting* that a traveler self-isolate upon arrival in Canada is too gentle. This is the way it should be phrased:

**WE, THE PEOPLE OF CANADA, DEMAND YOU SELF-ISOLATE FOR 14 DAYS UPON ARRIVAL IN CANADA**

This applies to **ALL** people. Visitors, residents and citizens. USA visitors should just stay away, because self-isolation is **NO FUN**

 Should I continue working?  I am 18 I live with my family. I work at a local grocery store part time 24 hrs a week. Not essential money but I just do it to get some spending cash and save up for travel. My mom is immunocompromised and I am wondering if I should just stop working until this dies down as if i get covid out working, there is a high chance she will get it and the rest of my family before I even start to show symptoms. What do you guys think?

As we come to Friday the 13th, Ontario increases its positive cases by another 20 cases. But as we look at the numbers of cases being tested, we can see the quantity steadily rising. However, even with the large amounts of tests each day, it is unable to stop the tide of the number of cases under investigation. Continuing to grow each day even with the increase of testing capabilities. An important key to focus on is Ontario's 67th case, a man in his 80s. He has been hospitalized and is now the only case in Ontario to do so. 

Following the closure of public schools yesterday, various universities and colleges in Ontario are closing as well. Examples like the University of Toronto, York University, Seneca College, etc. 

The number of cases today seemed to have overwhelmed even the personnel updating the website as now shortforms are used instead of their original names. ("Peel Public Health" is now just "Peel"). We also have an increase of "pending status" on cases, from the 75th case to the 79th case, we have no information on the case besides the fact that they are in Toronto. This is worrisome as it almost feels like that they're trying to hide the information.

 British Columbia: Stop the Half Measures Where I'm from, in Vancouver, nobody is social distancing. People are going out, hosting BBQs, playing soccer, etc. There are really very few rules or ways to enforce this. I have my doubts that people in my direct areas are the only ones. How many people are visiting friends/relatives right now? Than number is unknown but sure to be high. I know people that still go get food from restaurants as if not eating in will protect you from a chef who is sick.

Enough of this charade. The government needs to either lock down the province and stop this thing completely, or open it up completely. Our numbers in BC are staying level. The situation is not worsening, even with people mucking around everywhere. Let us get back to our normal lives.

Flame me. I am not the only one who believes this.

 Is there a summary somewhere of the restrictions and recommendations in each province? That would be interesting to compare. In Newfoundland the restrictions for the general population are: no gatherings over 5 people, nonessential retail closed, restaurants are delivery/drive-through only.

The recommendations are much stronger though. No association with people outside your household whatsoever, no nonessential travel. So even driving to a nice hiking spot or talking to your friend from 6 feet away is not recommended.

I am curious how this compares to other places.  From social media it seems that people in BC are free to go wherever they want to enjoy the outdoors for example.

I also thought I read somewhere that Alberta is saying it's ok to socialize with one other household but I can't find a source.

 Pressure from family to visit, have dinner with and share a cabin for a week as a potentially high risk person. Looking for any insight on our situation I don’t know how high risk I am but I had asthma as a kid/teen but I haven’t had any issues with it for a long long time. I’ve heard that getting sick enough could trigger it again even though I haven’t had a puffer in many years. I was also taking hydroxychloroquine (an immune suppressant) for the last 6 months as of last Sunday I’ve stopped taking it (doctor approved). 

I’ve been treating myself as high risk but my boyfriends family is putting a fair bit of pressure on us to visit which we have done outside and not eating or drinking anything but we get pressured to eat treats like cakes and tea or coffee. It’s uncomfortable having to repeatedly say no we are ok thanks over and over again. We’ve told them why we are being so careful but it hasn’t really helped. 

With Father’s Day coming up my bf and his brothers are taking him to go golfing, which is fine in my book (outside and easy enough to distance from each other) but after they want us to come for dinner. The couple times we’ve been there they don’t do a very good job keeping distance and again we are constantly pushed to eat and drink. Plus I’m pretty sure they will want to be inside (this would likely be a 9 person gathering from 4 households). 

This is where I think I might be being overly cautious but I don’t really feel like they are being careful enough. They are eating fast food, grocery shopping every week, and the brothers with their SO’s are hanging out with friends and family a fair bit. Camping and hiking not really keeping distance from what I can tell from pictures. 

On top of all this before all this went down we were planning on sharing a cabin for a week in July and they still want to do it. It looks like three out of the nine might not be there but still I don’t think it’s a good idea. But at the same time am I being ridiculous? I don’t know I’m high risk.. And the number of new cases in B.C. is continuing to drop... the chances that any of them have been in contact with someone contagious might be pretty unlikely. Buuuttt... my mom recently had their first positive case at her work...  

Basically, we are having trouble dealing with it diplomatically and rationally as someone who may be high risk.

 An infuriating experience on transit today An older woman and a young man - strangers to each other - decided to engage in a lengthy but banal conversation about hand sanitizers while seated across the aisle from each other while neither were wearing any kind of face covering. They exposed everyone in that confined space to their aerosolized germs. 
The woman was told by another passenger to stop talking her because she was spreading her germs, but carried on anyways. 
Couldn’t believe the selfish and idiotic behaviour! Also, this was midday and neither of these chatter boxes were carry any shopping or appeared dressed for work. So just two idiots larking about on public transit and striking up conversations with strangers.
++++++++++
 If someone in your household is high risk, can you take a leave from work? 
I live with my partner and their family. My partners brother just moved back in because of relationship complications. He has no spleen and a compromised immune system and a common cold puts him in the hospital, it could actually kill him. 

I work at a grocery store and got open coughed on by a customer today... to me that’s a last straw. I’m done with people. Now with him living here If I catch corna from a customer, and not know because the symptoms can be invisible, then pass it on to him. He will be in critical condition and most likely die. 

His mom is also a healthcare worker at the hospital so we’re taking extreme precautions to protect the people in our household. 

I have enough savings for my rent for a couple months. Food will be okay because my partners still getting pay from their work and the government. As well a majority of our other bills. 

But my only question is can they fire me? Is this something I can actually do because I really don’t want to get sick... and him sick. Is this a stupid question? I don’t know what to do really I just don’t want to risk it but I wanna job to come back to, you know? 

Please don’t be rude or anything, I just need some advice of what I can do in my situation.

 Help with dealing with parents So I haven't seen my parents in a month. And I need advice on how to deal with them. My mom really wants to help us out and insists she is healthy and hasn't seen anyone. I have told her repeatedly that we cannot see each other until this is all done. 

But now she realizes we might not see each other for over a year and has started freaking out (in 32 years i haven't seen this side of her). She screamed at me over the phone today saying our house is a prison and me and my kids might as well die in here. 

Now my parents say that my not letting them over is a sign that I don't trust them and that we can pretty much say goodbye to them forever because they will never forgive me. 

They are definitely not making this easy and im frankly worried about their mental health. They also have keys to our house and I worry about them coming and visiting. I just need advice on how to get through this with my parents. I know im making the right choice but I don't know how to deal with their emotions and ensure they will be ok by the end of this.

 my city (london) has very recently declared an emergency for our city. I am 29 and i have been self isolating and reducing contact by almost extreme measures. in the last 3 weeks i have only come into contact with 2 others 1 time (my close neighbours), and they have also been self isolating and taking this very seriously. my roomate who is 64 years old is regularily going out and 'running errands (aka getting beer)' and meeting up with other friends and family regularily.... every single day she has a total of 3-5 different people that she sees or hangs out with at my house alone. Should i be worried? they are also kind of dumb people (let me explain) , they believe masks will increase your chances of illness and they also believe hand moisturizer will protect them better than hand sanitizer or washing (they believe it acts as a barrier) .  i obviously realise how daft they are , but i also want to do my part.  


what can i say or do to improve the situation without getting kicked out? should i move out?  any advice will be appreciated, i realise this is a pretty dumb situation but its where i sit at the moment.

 Coronavirus control: Do you prefer physical freedom over digital freedom. Assuming Canada would implement a form of digital/big data tracking of Coronavirus infected or potentially infected citizens and at the same time all of us would wear mask protection outdoor but retain our physical freedom (No internal lockdown). Would you prefer this situation where we are physically free but the infected are tracked, over the current situation where none of us is tracked but we also are not free to go around because of self-isolation requirements?

In other words, would you agree **temporarily** loosing digital freedom (in specific cases) over all of us loosing physical freedom for the remaining of the crisis?

For example, i am talking about the different ways Canada and Taiwan handles the crisis.

**Canada:** digital freedom preferred over physical freedom.

**Taiwan:** Physical freedom preferred over digital freedom.

 Toronto Public Health officials barred from publicly revealing their advice to Doug Ford’s provincial government [

"Everyone participating in the provincial table that provides public health advice to senior government officials has been made to sign a non-disclosure agreement, Toronto’s board of health heard Monday.

Dr. Eileen de Villa, the city’s medical officer of health, told a board of health meeting that Toronto Public Health has participated in the province’s public health measures table “since its inception.”

But de Villa said she could not share any advice that table has provided to Ontario’s chief medical officer of health because TPH members have signed non-disclosure agreements, as have all other members of the table.

“Unfortunately, given the terms under which we participate on the table, we are required to keep the discussions and the advice that’s provided at that table confidential,” de Villa said.

After hearing that, the board of health moved to ask the provincial government to “immediately implement a fully transparent process of receiving public health advice,” including making public the advice provided to the chief medical officer of health and cabinet.

The motion from board chair Coun. Joe Cressy was adopted unanimously.

The move by Toronto’s board of health comes after [the Star reported]( that the provincial government ignored its own expert advice when it finalized a framework for reopening that contained thresholds four times higher in some cases than what was advised.

The province has since [amended its framework]( to raise the bar for reopening across the province.

The public health measures table is led by Dr. David McKeown, a former Toronto medical officer of health, and it provides advice to current chief medical officer Dr. David Williams. Williams, in turn, provides advice to Premier Doug Ford’s cabinet.

“Recommendations from this table are informed by emerging evidence and are in keeping with guidance from the Public Health Agency of Canada,” a provincial memo from April says.

De Villa said she couldn’t speak to whether signing non-disclosure agreements with the province is “normal practice,” but said she is aware it has happened previously among participants at provincial tables.

She said the meetings are called by the ministry of health and include ministry staff.

Coun. Gord Perks questioned why expert public health advice is being kept secret, calling it “shocking.”

“I can’t know what the experts are telling the chief medial officer of health. I can’t know what the chief medical officer of health is telling the provincial cabinet. And I can’t know what evidence or information or lobbying or other input is being considered by the provincial cabinet when they’re deciding what the rules will be for dealing with COVID,” he said.

“You cannot ask members of a society to pull together, to join together, to work together, to contribute together if the provincial government is isolating itself from that effort by hiding behind a veil of secrecy.”

New Democrat Leader Andrea Horwath said full transparency is needed to shine a light on potentially dangerous advice, such as the 10 per cent threshold that caused health experts outside government to go “ballistic” because it was too lax and could lead to faster spread of the virus.

“Mr. Ford is trying to hide the decision-making process,” she charged. “People just don’t trust the government anymore.”

At Queen’s Park, Premier Doug Ford evaded questions on revealing sources of advice — such as the controversial 10 per cent case positivity rate threshold for moving a health unit into the red zone that was scrapped on Friday in favour of a much lower 2.5 per cent rate recommended by Public Health Ontario.

“I don’t know of any other government across Canada that’s been more transparent. It’s unprecedented transparency,” Ford said in reference to his daily news conferences and release of COVID-19 statistics.

Ontario’s chief medical officer later said keeping the sources of recommendations and details surrounding them secret is part of “due process” in government.

“That advice, because it’s going toward a cabinet decision, has to be kept confidential,” said Williams.

“Our challenge here is that we listen to all the different voices,” Williams told reporters, adding health experts approach issues from their own perspectives.

“When you see things from different areas, you have a different perspective … everyone has strong opinions.”

Ford and cabinet could choose to make the advice public as Toronto’s board of health has requested.

“You deserve to see the same data I see when I’m making decisions,” [Ford told the public in April](

 I’m in Ontario- how do I report a neighbour who travelled and won’t quarantine? My landlords returned from a month-long Florida vacation on March 30 and are not self-isolating. We asked them to self-isolate and their response was “sometimes you have to break the rules”.   They collected rent cheques from all 24 units in my building and went to a public bank today! They are using the communal laundry room and wandering around the building.  Do I report them to public health? Bylaw?

 US Citizen looking to return home for short trip from Ontario Hoping to find some advice on travelling to the US from Toronto. I'm an American citizen who is living and working in Toronto on a visa looking to return home to Philadelphia for a short trip to see my family at the end of July. My boyfriend, a UK citizen, is also looking to come. We recently heard that Canadians are able to enter the US by air. I also read that my boyfriend may be able to come since he has been in Toronto for 6 months and hasn't travelled anywhere else and we've been quarantined. Does anyone have any more credible information on this? Or maybe know where to direct me? Any advice helps, thanks!

 A living arrangement risk question for our experts... I live alone in an apartment. My apartment is in an older house converted to three one bedroom apartments. We each have a furnace, the three furnaces are located together in the basement, there is passive air return through ducts into the basement. We did not have any contact or interaction with each other, separate entrances. 

Can an infected person in one of the apartments infect other tenants? I think, no or very very low risk, since the virus is droplet borne, would have to survive through the intake air filters,  and the heating process. That being said, I wouldn't say it is impossible, especially after, say, an extended shutdown or repair work, or high humidity. 

 I don't know enough about modern furnaces, the volume of air three furnaces running at the same time draw, or all the other factors or the durability of the virus.  Maybe there is already guidelines or research out there. 

 I mainly want to ease some anxiety, I  would hate to increase my risk out of ignorance about this, maybe, simply installing furnace filters is recommended.  Does anybody know?

 I want opinions on something. I'm a student and I have a really good rent deal where I live with an older couple in Ottawa. I don't know their ages but I'd like to say they are between 50-70 years old and one of them has some afflictions which makes them especially high risk. Once this whole thing started, they told me and the other 2 people living here that if anyone went out to a restaurant or to "hang out" with other people, that person would be kicked out. The other 2 moved out because they found the restrictions too strict. I've been outside to get groceries at Walmart 3 times since the middle of March. I was accused once of going out in the middle of the night in the first half of April. (They later found proof that I wasn't.)

I feel that going out 3 times since the middle of March is pretty good compared to most. But being cooped up is getting to me and I miss human contact. I've considered sneaking out a few times but have chickened out every time. The only people I want to see is my girlfriend and my parents. Mostly just my girlfriend though. All of them have been self-isolating pretty much almost as well if not just as well as I have.

Obviously, I take their health into great consideration. But I take every precaution necessary when I go out and so does my girlfriend. Am I being an asshole? Are they being too strict?

What do you folks think?

 As the Coronavirus curve peaks, so does the mental health crisis in this country. Having lost my mother to suicide less than a year ago, and dealing with my own bouts of anxiety and depression, I was well aware of the toll this self isolating period may take on certain individuals. We already had a crisis, and this would only magnify it.

Today, my colleagues and I were informed that one of our coworkers had taken her life over the weekend.

She was a beautiful girl, a social butterfly. Having her on social media, I could tell that this period was weighing on her heavily. May she rest easy.

With this news, combined with the news coming out of Nova Scotia this past weekend, it is clear that the coming weeks will test many. I've seen many echo this sentiment over the past few days, both on this forum and others.

Articles have been posted here citing doctors and government officials saying that there will be an uptick in deaths from people not visiting ER; but what about these people? Are they simply indirect casualties of this situation? This period needs to end as soon as possible, I think we all know that, but it may be even more dire than those in charge realise.

 Advice needed: moving help Forgive me if this is off topic but I’m fairly certain this is allowed here.

I live in Ontario, Canada. In two weeks I will be moving to a house 40 mins away to a very rural area. Currently I live in a rental townhouse in a suburb (not in the city). 

I’m honestly extremely worried about this. Worst case scenario if movers aren’t available, will I be able to just move myself over the course of a few days... right? Even if we do go on lockdown, will I still be able to leave my house and drive to the new one?

A lot will be changing in the coming weeks. I just need reassurance that I will still be able to move. Or will I not be able to move?

Got me thinking: how do they know it was travel-related and not community spread? Or do they?

If a person comes back from Austria to Toronto and then 2 weeks later tests positive... do they automatically assume it’s travel-related from Austria? Can they validate the original source? Do they simply ignore the possibility that he might have picked it up by community spread during the 2 weeks he was running around TO?

 College is out soon, need a job I live in Saskatchewan, Canada. It isn't bad here yet, but it will be. As of Saturday night we had six cases as a province. I receive my last student loan payment of $500 at the end of the month, other than that I have like $20 to my name till then. 

I've worked in the social service industry previously, so I figured a summer job at an emergency receiving group home for children would be perfect. I have an interview Tuesday, only now I am very nervous at the prospect at working with kids that had just been apprehended from a home where they, or other family members, may have been infected. I wonder if I should just live off of my $1,000 credit card for as long as possible (I ALWAYS pay it off immediately, but this is a different circumstance).

 Dr Randy Cron Talks of Cytokine Storm in Covid-19 Patients and Possible Solutions 
++++++++++
 I posted this 2 days ago and was downvoted by the argumentative trolls on this site. I'll repost my concern. Why are 10 year old kids delivering the weekly rural paper door to door in my small town? What if one of them is from a home where a sibling or parent has the virus and has passed it on to the delivery child. The child, maybe not shoeing symptoms but carrying the virus,  coughs and sneezes on their hand, then places a contaminated paper into the mailbox of vulnerable seniors or chronically ill people. They in turn bring the paper inside and touch the contaminated parts. People being people, they will lick their thumb to turn the page. Instead of blaming the readers for not using common sense, how about the paper delivery is stopped? The kids are also being exposed to potentially hot houses by going right up to the door and opening potentially contaminated mailbox covers and spreading contamination.
This is serious. Eliminating all potential sources of contamination and exposure is paramount. The contrarian trolls who nitpick every word and line are the same ones we see on the news at night breaking the rules.
Lets stop the paper delivery. Safe a life.

 HWDSB and corona virus How many teachers will not self-quarantine because of reprisal or fear of not getting paid? 

Hello,

Stewards, please forward this email to all HWETL members on your email tree.

 For several weeks, the Local has been trying to get the HWDSB to suspend their Attendance Management Program (AMP) during the Covid-19 "pandemic".  While the board has sent out two memos with advice from Public and the WHO, to remain home from work and self-isolate if you are symptomatic, it has also has the punitive AMP which clearly pressures members to report to work when they are ill.  We felt that these contradictory messages weren't helpful at this time.  Medical professionals have advised the public to remain home if they are symptomatic and not to overtax the medical system with unnecessary visits to doctors (like getting notes for Attendance Management Programs.  The board has so far refused.

However, we do have Collective Agreement Language which states,

L18.03

“The following items are not chargeable to the sick leave plan and shall be without loss of salary:  Quarantine - Any teacher who because of exposure of communicable disease is quarantined or otherwise prevented by Medical Health Authorities from being present for duty.”

 The Local advice is that you follow the advice of your medical practitioner, Public Health, and the WHO.  If you are self-isolating because you are symptomatic, our advice is that you do not feel pressure to return to work.

The Local is working with the board to provide a SFX code for "Quarantine".  If it is not available, please use the SFX code for personal illness and inform your HWETL Vice-President that you have done so.  If possible, please try to acquire some sort of documentation showing that your absence is related to Covid-19.  For example, an email from your medical practitioner.  Please don't go to extreme lengths in order to get this documentation such as violating the advice not to visit a Doctor's office, Urgent Care, or Emergency. 

Of course, if you require medical assistance, HWETL would always want you to access that in whatever manner you feel is necessary.

At some point, the HWDSB may close schools, or have their schools closed.  If this happens, our position, based on the above language, would be that teachers would still receive their pay.  However, as this is uncharted territory, we are not able to guarantee that the board would agree. 

In Solidarity,

Jeff Sorensen

 CERB Eligibility? I am currently a post-secondary student and reside with my family. My dad is diabetic and for that reason, I no longer go to work. I took time off work (grocery store) until the curve flattens as my father is at a high risk of becoming ill if I contract the virus and pass it on to him. Keeping in mind that I stay at home and therefore cannot self isolate away from family (we share living spaces). Am I eligible to receive the benefits of CERB?

 Terrible Communication by Public Health Hi there, 

I started feeling symptoms sometime this week, and went the next day to get a swab done. Two family members of mine started feeling symptoms the exact same day as me and also went for swabs within a few hours of me (at different testing center).  

At the testing center I was told by the Dr. to isolate in my house until results are available. I was also given a pamphlet on which each pages describes what to do in each specific scenario. My specific scenario was:  

\- feeling symptoms  

\- not close contact with a case  

\- not travelled outside Canada  

  

Under what to do for testing Negative it says:  

"if your test is negative, you may stop self-isolating after you are symptom free for 24 hours. A follow-up test is not required. You can return to activities (e.g., work) at this time"  

  

Luckily all 3 of us tested negative.

Now, here's where I'm really frustrated. Only 1 of my family members from the other testing center received a follow up call AFTER receiving test results, to say that they still must isolate for 14 days in case of false negative.  The other family member who got tested within minutes of them received no such call. I received no such instruction at all (or so I thought).  

I decided to dig into my online results and saw that there were appointment notes separate from the test results (I received no email about these notes and was never instructed to look for them).  At the very bottom of these notes it reads:  

"Current COVID swabbing criteria have been discussed with patient.

  If symptomatic - self isolation for 14 days from symptom onset.  

If swabbed - they will be contacted by public health or the hospital with the results.  

If negative - should stay home and self isolate at least 14 days after symptoms started in case swab falsely negative.  

If not swabbed - self isolate at least 14 days after symptoms started.  

Close contacts should also stay home and self isolate for at least 14 days.  

Information package given to patient."  

  

1. the first line is a lie, this was NOT discussed with me.
2. this direction contradicts their own information package they mention.  
3. my 1 family member who received the call received no instruction about close contacts isolating.   

This is a complete embarrassment of communication.   Everyone should be told AT the testing center to isolate 14 days (not after results), and they should be told the full story that close contacts should isolate.  

End rant.

 Weekly Subreddit Update: Bans, Submissions, Flairs, and Anti-Evil Operations Hello all,

Today is the weekly update on what's been happening with the subreddit.  Let's get the first negative news out of the way.

---
#**Anti Evil Operations**

We got a notification in our discord that AEO acted on a comment that had been up for less than an hour at the time it was actioned.  It was a comment advocating violence against a user.  That's the first time we've seen AEO acted on anything less than an hour old.  It wasn't reported or even filtered by our automod.  

We aren't in trouble or anything, but we thought it was important to let you all know.  

---
#**Bans**

We are up to 37 bans (+1) from last week.  However, a bit misleading because we had four temporary bans elapse, and added five more bans to the list.   

* 1 permanent ban for vote manipulation
* 1 permanent ban for spamming
* 1 temporary ban for repeated incivility, and generally toxic behaviour (2 months)
* 1 temporary ban for racism / incivility 
* 1 temporary ban for misinformation

We're being as lenient as possible, but in some cases, we just have to act.  We're doing everything we can to try and get to incivilities before they become a rampant problem.  This week was really good community wise.  So please continue reporting the incivilities, questionable posts, etc.  Even if they aren't actionable posts, it doesn't mean your reports are being ignored.

#**Submissions**

Just a friendly reminder: You must use [Media Bias Fact Check]( prior to submitting a link -- if the link isn't high or very high factual publisher, it will likely be removed.  We are doing this to limit propaganda and astroturfing interference.  Government sources are good, so don't hesitate to scour for links if you feel it's relevant to the COVID-19 impact in Canada and is presently related.  

Social Media posts must be submitted as a self-post with context in the post so that we can better understand the discussion / question(s).  There will be far more clarity in the comments.

#**Flairs**

A gentle reminder you can flair your province (or if you're from out of the country, international flair).

someone in store coughs,droplets land on this and that,then lady walks into store sets purse on something to remove whatever is needed to pay then walks away with virus on bottom of purse,goes home then sets purse on counter,now the virus is in the house

well basically if you touched anything in that store where infected person coughs then touch things inside your purse or wallet u just contaminated both of these highly used parts of our lives

so how can we clean our purses and wallets? these objects are not easy to clean every time u come home

what can we do? oven at low temp maybe? microwave but not everything idk? set purse or wallet on heat outlet in house but would that kill it over night idk?

 Is this information correct? “Children are not carriers of the virus”, as told by a teacher union president in BC. Hello everyone,

I am a teacher in BC who just received a concerning email from my union president concerning COVID-19. I thought I would post to see if anyone could clarify information I might be missing, or to assuage my fears that this information is not as misinformed as it first appears.

The following information was supposedly told to provincial union presidents by Dr. Trevor Corneil, and has apparently been disseminated officially by teacher association presidents across the province. 

Here are some of the more concerning quotations from the email: 

\----------------------------------------------------------------

5) children are not carriers of the virus and do not seem to be infecting other children

….

7) The virus does not live on paper or cardboard or wood products”

And

“For those teachers volunteering child care for the children of our health care workers need not fear that the children will transmit the virus to you. Keep your distance from other adults who are working with you and practice increased personal hygiene and all should be safe. The buildings are cleaned following these guidelines.” 

“Based on factual information coming from the Ministry of Health, children do not pose a risk with this virus and so our numbers have increased from a 1-5 ratio to this week a 1-10 ratio. It could go as high as 1-15.”

\-------------------------------------------------

Is this information accurate? Are children really not vectors for the virus? I worry if this information is false, it could be putting lives at risk. If it’s true, that is great news! I would really appreciate your input on this, Reddit!

 Opinion: Nurses aren't Heros Nurses have a lot of things going for them, at least in BC where I am from (things may be different in other areas). 

Nurses get paid extremely well here. It is not uncommon to see a six figure paycheck. They also have great job security. The risks of the job were easy to see when they decided to take this career path. Why the hell are we treating these people like heros?? The worry for their safety has ruined lives for everyone. Specifically, flattening that curve. We ground our economy to a halt because we needed to make sure that our nurses weren't overwhelmed ( which is fair) but the other side of that agreement entails that should our medical system not be overwhelmed, we can go about life normally.

Now, recent grads are watching nursing boom at the expense of their own lives. We want to have a career too. Risk within one job should not be able to ruin the jobs of others. That's like if electricians started to electrocute themselves and we banned all athletic events. 

Nurses: this is the risk you signed up for. Quit ruining life for the rest of us. Your lives are not more valuable than the rest of ours.

 Is drinking takeout coffee on Toronto's streets while walking allowed under COVID19 restrictions? I noticed Tim Hortons and Second Cup still serving takeout coffee. On the other hand, to be out you are supposed to be only for essentials like exercise and grocery shopping. 

So if the police sees a guy walking while drinking a coffee, can they ticket them because they engaged in a nonessential activity? 

What counts more: the guy walking (= essential exercise) or the guy drinking coffee (non-essential reason for being out)?

If everyone played their part in this, it would save so many lives.

I am a psychology student and Teaching Assistant at an Ontario University that closed down yesterday. I have been watching the COVID subreddits for two months now - and have a good idea about how our situation will look in a week or two. 

I feel a responsibility to arrange a coordinated network of people who may be willing to volunteer in some capacity before everyone starts to scramble. We all have special talents and areas of expertise - some of which may be extremely useful during this time. As a recent psychology grad with a specialization in end-of-life decision-making (I did my honours thesis on the withdrawal of TX - specifically about ventilator removal), I understand that there will be extreme trauma to the families whose loved ones will go through this. In the event that this goes very badly for us, I will be offering Zoom meetings to anyone who needs to talk if this happens in their family. I am not a qualified psychologist, and will NOT be purporting to offer specialized support - but I can be a listening ear. 

What is your talent? Do you have special knowledge about something that people may need to talk about? Do you know how to make great meals from canned food and could offer Zoom meetings about this? Do you know how to sew and could offer lessons online? Are you great at a video game and could host an online meeting about it? Do you have experience or knowledge about resources in your community and could act as a contact point? 

Any random talent or expertise can be used to connect our province-wide community in an effort to make this situation more bearable for all of us. We can also contribute to a sense of normalcy if we arrange community events on an online platform. Keeping busy contributes to maintaining calm and normalcy, which can have a very positive effect on our mental wellbeing.

If you think this is a good idea, and want to add your name and resource to my list so I can refer people - let me know!
