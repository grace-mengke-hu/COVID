 If you’re able to work from home can your boss force you to come to the office during a pandemic? My husband is a lawyer in Toronto and therefore been deemed an essential worker. His firm had set up a VPN and allowed most people to work from home aside from a few clerks who come in on a rotating schedule.  It’s been working well, and my hubby has been getting a lot done in his home office. 

The owner of the law firm was getting complaints from the clerks about having to work in the office while others worked at home. It really was unnecessary to have them in the office too. So instead of making arrangements for the clerks to work at home, the entire firm has been called back to work. The owner has been bullying the lawyers and has suggested that there will be layoffs if people don’t work in the office.   My husband has refused to go in, to put himself and myself at risk when he’s able to work at home and has the technology to do so securely.

Can an employee force employees to work in the office when they are able to work effectively at home?   It’s very distressing and the owner’s aggressive approach to forcing people back to work is off putting. This person also suggested one of the lawyers rent accommodation after disclosing she has elderly family at home and an immunocompromised husband. Again, everyone is able to work at home.

 Rights around working right now - Ontario/GTA Hi everyone,

I am sure this has been asked before, but I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed so I am hoping for some direct answers/support.

I have a friend who is a worker in a construction-ish trade, and is paid by the hour. Their company is refusing to close and is business as usual, but my friend does not feel safe going into work (for multiple reasons, including transportation to and from work, number of people, etc). They don’t want to lose their job once this is all over with, but they are confused as to what their rights are around refusing work/claiming EI (in Ontario/ the GTA). 

Does anyone know what they can do in this situation, short of quitting/being fired? Again, they want to be safe but obviously will need a job to return to. Any resources I can send them? Again I tried to look online but felt quite overwhelmed and my anxiety was becoming a lot. 

Thanks for your help!

 Is this an indicator that if one has been exposed to some forms of the common cold recently, that it may help them build up an immunity and/or greatly lower the chance of death if stricken with the worse off covid-19?  

So a combination of reading, questioning, and noting these following things has made me consider that this title may be true possibly... What do you think?

1. Recently read that around 30% of cases of the common cold are caused by different forms of corona viruses and this has been happening for a long time.
2. I notice that the mortality rates in Spain and Italy are much much higher than those in northern Europe....was thinking might not just be age related.
3. Are colds typically spread more and more strains of them spread more in colder places than warmer places in the winter?
4. With flu vaccinations, they often make an educated guess on what flu will be the most prominent, and offer that vaccine....doesnt that still help fight off flus that arnt the primary strain. Not so sure on this or if that matters....

Essentially, if one is exposed to the less severe corona virus colds in the past couple years, do you think this helps possibly build up some sort of immunity to the more lethal corona virus? Just think something else is at play here, South Korea has a lot of smokers and I think it still has a pretty old population as well.....but they seemed more prepared to fight this. Guess time will tell in helping to explain the discrepencies in mortallity rates, where age and other preexisting health problems arnt the only main factors. What do you think? Be cool if I could get an expert to respond to this, someone who knows a lot about how often and frequently the common cold spreads in different climates, poorer and richer countries, and in more densely populated locoations over others. Think 3rd world might be fine, even with warmer climates, cause feel they often exposed to more diseases overall maybe even colds due to less saniton available....hope thats the case. Stay safe out there!

So if my title I asked is correct, and countries are throwing the idea of building up a herd immunity....are they looking down this route of exposing population to less severe cold....well they should be possibly, instead of just doing it with covid 19.

Thanks for your time.

 My husband's boss is forcing the employees to work at Toronto Pearson Airport, is there any way to take legal action against this? Hi all,

I apologise if this is not the place to post this... So if I must be redirected, I will update this post to help you navigate back to this information.

Anyways, my husband works for maintenance at Toronto Pearson Airport, where just last Thursday, March 12th, he was working at the International Arrivals. Since this coronavirus stuff is just getting worse and worse by the hour... My husband doesn't feel it is safe to go back to work. I absolutely DO NOT want him going back, but he's feeling pressure to go back because he is afraid of losing his job.

So my question... Is there any way my husband can just decide "not to go into work" and have the law on his side?

I'm worried sick for him... There is still so much we do not know about this virus. We are both young (early-mid 20s), but even if we get it and we're "fine", who knows what the long term health consequences are? What if we spread it to more vulnerable members of our family? 

It's really pissing me off that his boss is "making" people go into work... And what's worse is that other people at his work want to go in to get money to pay their mortgages. So it's not like other staff are upset about the boss's decision.

Please help. Redirect me to a better page to post this if it's necessary... But don't just delete my post without warning me.

 Possible 2nd/3rd Degree Exposure My boyfriend (27) saw a friend 2 weekends ago on Sept 25 and found out the following Thursday, Oct 1 that his friend tested positive. I (27) saw him on Tuesday, Sept 29 which means I could possibly be exposed to the virus if my boyfriend ends up testing positive. He went for a test on Oct 2 but has not received results yet. 

I live with my mom and brother and have been quarantining in my basement and I wear a mask every time I have to go upstairs, just to be extra careful. I have not seen my boyfriend since Sept 29. Should they be worried since they would be considered 3rd degree exposure? My mom has to go to into work so she is wondering if she needs to let work know.

 Theory on why we are seeing such varying degrees of illness. I want to start this by saying that I am not in any field of work to claim any of my opinions as viable, I'm just putting my thoughts out there to see what others think. 

For my theory to make sense we have to start on the assumption that we will discover that you can indeed be reinfected by this virus which based on recent studies is not out of the question.

My theory is that what if the reason we are seeing such varying levels of illness is because as recent studies have proven from sewage tests dating all the way back to 2019 that this virus has been with us for longer than we initially thought. With knowing that people are saying well why didn't this pandemic start sooner? Perhaps what is happening is that assuming  reinfection is possible is that depending on which number of times you've been infected dictates how ill you will be based on each infection slowly damaging your body. Say for most ppl the first infection you are generally asymptomatic or just mildly ill, which clears up the confusion as to why some ppl get sick and some don't. Now once you reach third or even possibly your four time being infected these are the people ending up in the hospital with now serious complications due to prior damage from the last boughts of fighting it off. 

Again I am not an expert and in no way am I claiming any of this as facts but if my theory is true it would fill in a lot of blanks including why different countries are seeing such varying degrees of illness and death. Places like Italy and others in Europe perhaps being tourists hot spots have already had more of the population go through their first and second infections and have more ppl on their third or fourth hence why they are seeing more hospitalization and death.

Thank you for taking the time to read this, I have put my thoughts out there in hopes that people with more knowledge about viruses could explain if this theory is even possible.
