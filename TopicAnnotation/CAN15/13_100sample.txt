 STUDY: 10-minute online survey on perception of face mask use and physical distancing in Canada **Practice of Face Mask Use and Physical Distancing among Canadians during the outbreak of COVID-19**

**What is the research about?**  
The goal of this study is to gather information about the knowledge and beliefs Canadians have in regards to using face masks and implementing physical distancing measures, as well as the impacts these measures have had on their daily lives.  In collaboration with the Hong Kong Polytechnic University and other international partners, the results of this study will also be compared to face mask usage internationally, such as Hong Kong, Mainland China, Korea, U.S., Brazil, and the Philippines.

The findings from this survey will contribute to the knowledge regarding current public health interventions and to help develop more effective programs in the case of future outbreaks of influenza-like illnesses.

**Who should participate?**

This anonymous online survey is opened to anyone currently living in Canada and aged 18 or above.

**Where can you buy surgical masks ?**

These days so many people are so anxious, scared of the COVID-19 or novel coronavirus that’s quickly spreading around the world. It has already infected hundreds of thousands of people. While people who have recovered from the disease far outnumber the deaths, the number of infected people continues to rise.

People now have a new appreciation of medical protective gear like medical face masks to help prevent the spread of infection, and of medical devices like infrared thermometers that help detect infection. The demand for these items is so high that there appears to be a worldwide shortage at the moment.

So, where do you buy these face masks and infrared thermometers? Where else but China, of course.

**Where to purchase medical face mask and infrared thermometer in china**

**Alibaba: Online**

Known as the Amazon of China, Alibaba is the leading wholesale mobile marketplace for global trade.

**Xiantao: China’s main production center of masks**

Xiantao is a city in Central China’s Hubei province known to be the country’s leading production center of face masks and a significant local medical equipment manufacturing base.

The city is a major industrial hub for non-woven products used in surgical masks. Among the manufacturers are Xiantao Yinhong Protective Products Co. Ltd, Hubei Safeway Protective Products Co., Xiantao Zhongtai Protective Products, to name a few.

**Sourcing agent**

At this time, there’s an urgent need worldwide to source medical masks and infrared thermometers in large quantities. No one has the luxury of time to do thorough research on each supplier they read on a list.

The best and fastest way to find trusted suppliers is to hire a sourcing agent from China.

A sourcing agent will help you find quality face masks and infrared thermometers at the best factory price. Your sourcing agent will act as your representative in China, executing your orders and negotiating with suppliers and shipping companies, and taking care of needed documentation.

**What is the best type of surgical masks**

**N95**

Commonly used in healthcare settings, an N95 respirator is a “single-use,” disposable respiratory protective device that blocks at least 95% of tiny (0.3 micron) test particles when properly fitted. The N 95 respirator is usually worn by healthcare professionals during procedures to protect both patient and healthcare staff from the transfer of microorganisms, body fluids, and particulate material.

Respirators come in various sizes and must be individually selected to fit the wearer’s face and to provide a tight seal.

&amp;#x200B;

**Surgical Masks**

A surgical mask is a loose-fitting, disposable medical device that serves as a physical barrier between the nose and mouth of the wearer, and possible contaminants in the immediate surrounding.

When worn correctly, surgical masks help block large particle droplets, splashes, sprays, or splatter that may contain germs (viruses and bacteria), keeping it from reaching the mouth and nose.

 Canadian Tire Price Gouging? When I was in Vancouver last week, I stopped by the Canadian Tire on Cambie and saw that they had big bins of N95 masks, surgical masks, hand sanitizers, and gloves still available.  I picked some up to send to high risk family in Alberta who haven't been able to find anything for the past few weeks.  I thought the prices were high, but didn't really have time to compare, and it was quite a rush since many people were buying them too.

The N95s were broken up into singles or doubles.  These weren't the single masks with ventilators in plastic clamshells, but appeared repackaged in polybags with store UPC stickers.  

* The cheaper ones were Sperian N1105 Molded Cups, and were available at $7.99 each or a 2-pack for $15.99.  Online, I found a listing for $17.99 for 20 ($0.90/each): [ .  That's an 888% markup.
* The $8.99 ones were 3M 8200 Industrial Respirators, found here for $23 for a carton of 20, or $21 for a over 10 cartons ($1.15-1.05): [ between 782%-856% markup.
* I bought a box of Condor 50 Surgical facemasks for $34.99 (day before they were marked at $32.99 on sale from $39.99), which I found here for $9.31: [ almost a 387% markup.

While I do understand the need of perhaps splitting the bigger boxes of 20 masks into smaller quantities so more people can access them, I am quite surprised at the extent they marked everything up.  It's funny that people are calling out individuals for price gouging during a pandemic, and meanwhile a major Canadian retailer is doing the same thing.  I'm not sure if this was happening in all Canadian Tires, but this was my experience in the Cambie location.

 My experience going to Costco in Toronto today in a full-face respirator I thought I would share this experience for anyone who is feeling shy about wearing their PPE in public.

My partner and I went to Costco today (in Toronto). Here's how it went:

* We wore full-face respirators with P100 filters, and disposable gloves. 
* We arrived 15 min before the store was scheduled to open. When we got there, the parking lot was 75% full, and we kind of freaked out. But it turned out the store had opened a lot earlier.
* We didn't have to wait at all to get in. They offered, but did not force us to use wipes to clean our carts (which we of course did).
* The store was not at all busy. They are limiting the number of people who can enter the store at once. It was basically like how Costco is during working hours, except that today is a Sunday. 
* We only had to wait a minute or two to check out.
* There were a LOT of mask-wearers. I'd say 1 in 4 people in that Costco was wearing some form of mask, about 50-50 surgical to N95. Most of those people also wearing gloves.
* Most products were well-stocked, except for obvious coronavirus prep supplies (gloves, disinfectant wipes, hand sanitizer). They had lysol, but it was limited to one can per membership.

We got some reactions: 

* Two or three people asked us where we got the respirators, and I yelled "Amazon!" but it's hard to communicate while wearing a FFR. Lol.
* One family pointed and laughed, but they were completely unprotected, so I guess we'll see who's laughing? All jokes aside, I hope they stay safe. 
* The unmasked cashier made some remarks about how we were dressed for Chernobyl, lol.
* The receipt checker said we looked really safe and gave us a thumbs up, that was nice.
* When we left the store there was a huge line to get in, and a lot of staring, but we took off the masks in the car to load up so it wasn't like they kept staring after that.
* It really wasn't that bad and the slight awkwardness was 100% worth how safe I felt.

Overall I feel good. I feel protected. We topped off our food and supplies so we can stay inside for at least a full month (probably two). We also grabbed a bunch of food for my partner's aging parents and dropped it off at their place.

When we got home we wiped all the packages down with disinfectant wipes and put it all away. Took off our clothes, washed them, and took showers. Now we're just gonna chill and work from home for the foreseeable future.

 Facts about N95 masks. I am going to repost a comment I made earlier in a thread which was talking about N95 masks. I heard a few people in conversation spreading misinformation and also have seen quite a few people improperly wearing or reusing N95s in public so I feel this needed more visibility. 

&gt; Yes N95s are sized and then seal checked. The process is basically they size you up for a mask and you put it on. Then they cover your entire head with a hood and spray some bitter and sweet sprays inside. If you taste either then your N95 failed the seal check and you try another size and repeat the test. All hospital staff know their size of N95. 

&gt; In regard to properly donning and doffing the mask, you are correct a used mask is dangerous. As it filters the air you breath the mask concentrates any contaminants from the environment onto the mask surface. To properly donn the mask you place it on your face and then put the elastics behind your head one at a time ensuring they are smooth and not crossed or caught in your hair. You then firmly press down the metal nose tab with your fingers so that it is snug. You then perform a seal check by exhaling repeatedly while holding your hands 4” or so from the edges of the mask, move your hands around the sides of your face like a “mime making a box around his head”, if you feel a breeze on your hands you failed the test and need to readjust. Once a snug fit is ensured you are ready to go to work. 

&gt; When doffing you never ever touch the “filter” part of the mask. You only touch the elastics!!! You never put the mask down around your neck or over your head. When taking it off it comes straight off in this very specific method: you take a forward leaning stance so your shoulders and neck are in front of your feet, you take the bottom elastic from behind your head and flip it up and over so it hangs loosely in front, you then take the top elastic and stretch it out sideways and up over your head while maintaining pressure to hold the mask still, at the critical moment when the elastic is in line with the mask you move the whole thing forward and away from your face in a smooth motion. Again you never touch the mask itself, you only touch the elastic when taking it off. It’s easier to show you the process than describe it. But I cannot stress this enough the masks are considered biohazards once used and go in the red/yellow bags for the incinerator. 

&gt; Additionally N95s are not actually a true filter, the virus is smaller than the opening in the mask and can pass through, however they work on the principle that they are a fine weave of random fibres and the virus gets caught and sticks to the weave. After extended use their effectiveness decreases. 

&gt; Another thing to note. Properly fitted N95s are difficult to breath in. You will get hot and sweaty and they restrict the airflow when you breath in (like breathing through a heavy sweater). Staff will change through multiple N95s throughout a shift and they are not worn for extended periods on end. Often not longer than 45-60 minutes maximum. If an N95 is comfortable and/or loose then it is not working properly. If there is not an airtight seal between the mask and your face then you are breathing “around” the mask. Air will always take the path of least resistance and the masks are serious resistance.

There will only be 4 of us there, so not crowded, and the pool is outdoors too, but are there concerns about spreading it through the water? Or could the pool chemicals be enough to kill the virus?
++++++++++
 Self-innoculation with surgical and non-medical masks? It seems like something that our top doctors keep saying, and on a smaller scale, my company (retail store focusing on pharmacy, stores in most of Western Canada) keeps saying retail workers don't need surgical masks, if someone wants to wear a homemade mask go ahead but remember the risk of self-innoculation - aka rubbing virus with your own hands into the outside of the "mask" and then inhaling it.

The way they've been talking about it it seems like the risk of self-innoculation if even higher than not wearing a mask at all. Now that's been seen as an excuse to not recommend buying of medical masks, and something our leaders have mislead us with. 

What's the actual science behind this? Is risk actually higher than not wearing a face covering?

 Planned travel in May Have had my honeymoon (literally the most money I’ve ever had at once) booked for months for Scotland in May. We have cancellation insurance but not ‘for any reason’ just for unavoidable things (government travel advisory is covered). 

We are now faced with cancelling now as a precaution and burning half the cost, cancelling closer to the travel dates and burning all of it, or hoping for a travel advisory to pop up on our travel dates so we can recoup the cost. 

I do not want to spread illness, I think all the March break planned travel is really selfish. On the other hand if I cancel this trip, I’ll likely never have another chance since this was a huge big ticket splurge that’s entirely out of character for me and my partner. It’s a big pill to swallow.

[It's what Health Canada recommends.](  I've been thrilled to hear about other countries, states, provinces and cities mandating masks in public indoor spaces.  But here in SK, that isn't happening.

We've had a brutal couple of days in terms of our numbers.  [Our number of known active cases have increased by 400% in less than 2 weeks.](  I'm not trying to sound alarmist, but it sounds like community spread is on the rise in Saskatchewan and things are going to get worse before they get better.  And yet masks have not been mandated.

Some people are diligently wearing their masks, but most people aren't.  People are blatantly ignoring the arrows in stores and are failing to physically distance - I've experienced it firsthand.  Some people are ignorant, some are oblivious and some are unwilling to subject themselves to a little inconvenience and discomfort to save lives.  Some just plain don't care.  Hell, my neighbor spews bullshit conspiracy theories about Bill Gates every chance he gets and has actively tried to talk my spouse and me out of wearing masks.  Because it's "not as bad" here as in other places or no one they personally know has caught it, a lot of people seem to think Covid-19 isn't a threat.

**Bottom line: most people here aren't going to wear masks unless they're forced to.**

The Saskatchewan Nurse's Union [has been begging for a mask mandate](  The Saskatchwan Medical Association [is calling on people to wear masks]( Countless people who work with the public wish masks were mandatory.

I decided to start a petition.  My hope is I can take it to decision makers in this province and use it to apply a little more pressure to them to mandate masks.  Maybe it will help or maybe it won't, but I have to try.  I'm hoping to reach 1,000 signatures, but I'll be contacting those in charge on Monday regardless as I don't want to wait too long.

**If you live in SK and care about reducing our number of active cases...**

**If you don't want people from SK spreading Covid-19 to your area when they travel...**

**If you care about sparing other human beings from preventable illness and death...**

**Please sign and consider sharing on social media.**

Thank you and stay safe!

 Airbnb asks government to bail out hosts in Canada due to Covid &amp;#x200B;

[

Is this really what Canada has come to?  Mega companies who never paid taxes and made life harder for Canadians now want us to bail  out their shady business practices. Socialism for the rich, hard austerity capitalism for the rest of us.

"Airbnb is asking the government to make employment benefits available to Airbnb hosts.

Airbnb also wants the government to defer sales taxes for short term rentals.

The platform also wants the government to defer income taxes for Airbnb hosts "

 Denmark has conducted a trial into the efficacy of community masking This has implications for public policy globally.  In Ontario we have seen case numbers climbing since masks were mandated.  Would the numbers have been worse with no masking?  Without scientific evidence all one can do is rely on conjecture.  

Nordsjaellands Hospital, Hvidovre University Hospital, Herlev Hospital and the Technical University of Denmark conducted the trial.  

6,000 participants (the largest ever masking trial) were identified as being virus free, people who spend at least 3 hours per day in the community.  They were randomly split into masked and non-masked arms.  They then tracked and measured the degree of infection in each arm.

We're simply now waiting on publication of their findings.  If they find that the masked arm had a statistically significant lower rate of infection than the unmasked arm that will go a long way to settling the entire masking debate.  Heretofore there has not been a RCT that has demonstrated a benefit in masks mitigating the spread of any virus which is something those opposed to mandatory masking have hung their hat on.

 [QUESTION] I am a Personal Support Worker for a disabled client. Is my client required to wear a mask for the duration of my shift? I wear all required PPE and take appropriate COVID precautions. She does not wear a mask during my shifts (8 hours). She also does not wear a mask when her other support workers come in. I've asked her, and she said that 3 out of 5 mask up regularly (including myself). To my knowledge, this means that 2 out of 5 don't. She has night staff that she will occasionally ask for help (there are four night PSW's on rotation), but as far as I know they are not consistently around her. I am not comfortable knowing that she has a rotation of people coming in and out of her home that do not take appropriate COVID precautions. Is it out of line for me to ask her to wear a mask? Can she refuse? What am I allowed and not allowed to do in this situation? 

When I've encouraged her to wear a mask, she'll wear it. However, she can be very sloppy with keeping it on. During meal times, I don't expect her to keep it on, but she has no problem staying close to me and having conversation with me at a distance less than 2m away. She can take a long time to finish her meal and throughout this time she is un-masked.

 Everyone, let's make and wear homemade masks. Hear me out. This works. There is evidence that wearing masks stops or at least reduces transmission both from infected people and helps stop people from being infected.

Obviously an infinite number of N95 masks would be ideal, but ANY MASK made of suitable material is better than nothing. 

There are many online tutorials showing what works for homemade masks. It's better than nothing.

If everyone wore them, EVERYONE, in public, it would reduce the spread by asymptomatic carriers, and make everyone safer. 

Why doesn't if have to be perfect? If a mask on an asymptomatic carrier is 80% effective, and the mask on the potential newly infected person is 80% effective it virtually ensures the transmission will not take place. 

This is being done in the Czech Republic they went to 100% adherence of wearing face masks and it really seems to be working.

To me this is our best chance of flattening the curve. But if people agree we need not just government directive social media influencers and famous athletes and actors and famous people to make it cool and we can change this.

 People are getting aggressive about wearing personal protection. The change over the last week is palpable. As a father of two and also an individual more at risk from covid-19 due to chronic health issues I've stocked up on 20 n95 masks back in January.

I wore a mask for the first time last week and I got a few concerned questions about if I was sick, but in general people were polite and understood the necessity for having protection. Maybe some nervous glances too.

Today was much different....

* I picked up some non-essential supplies at the corner store (as I was out anyway). I got yelled at by an employee for not announcing my health status as I entered the store. I was then chastised for wearing a mask because "the news says masks don't work". I have to respond "WTF would I be in here buying beer if I had covid-19 and if I did you should be happy i am wearing protection. Chill out!"

* I went to the vet to get my dog's heartworm medication for this spring and upcoming months. I was there last week and things were relaxed. Today they refused to speak to me, asked me to leave and call them. I've been a customer there since they opened several years ago.

* I went to the post office to pickup my medical cannabis as Canada Post is now redirecting packages requiring a signature to post offices. I showed up wearing my mask and with photo ID in hand. I was there last week for the same thing and had no issues. Today I was told I needed to take my mask off to validate my ID. I explained I couldn't due to health reasons. Then some busybody walking through the store starts shouting "she doesn't even have a mask you can take yours off for a minute, they don't even work!". Ended up having to tell her to mind her business and shut up. I had to leave without my medication as I refused to remove my mask and they wouldn't give it to me with one on.

All to say, in less than 7 days time lots of people are now scared, getting more aggressive and most have drank the kool-aid regarding masks the news and government is feeding them.

It's thoroughly disappointing. This pandemic has made me lose respect for some many people I know, and now it's led to ignorant strangers lashing out at those protecting themselves minding their own business.

We are in for a very rough ride in the weeks to come Canada :(

 City of Toronto Employment and social services cont. as normal - My friends mom who is a social worker with the City of Toronto employment and social services is being told to continue meeting with clients face to face without any masks cause public health hasn't mandated it as necessary. I'm at a total loss like how is this going to help and why hasn't the City mandated any precautions for working individuals who work with the vulnerable individuals and families potentially. What can be done?

 What would you do? I have a few extra boxes of face masks that I want to donate.
I understand that the greatest need is in Quebec. I'm in Alberta.
What do you think is the best course of action? Ship them to Quebec or wait until there is a need in Alberta? And there will be a need.
If the consensus is to ship to Quebec, please give suggestions as to who to contact?

 City of Barrie bus drivers just walked off the job during to safety concerns. Yesterday city council announced they were making public transit free for the time being. About 45 minutes ago bus drivers all walked off the job because of concerns over their safety. My sister is stranded now and this is the word going around facebook. No official word yet though.
