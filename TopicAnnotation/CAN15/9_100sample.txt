***~~Ontario’s death toll was listed as 36 yesterday, but is now 33. This is quite confusing. The death toll is currently counted as 36 in Ontario until further news.~~ Death toll in Ontario confirmed to be 37 with today’s 4 new deaths, therefore, I am adding only 1 new death today for Ontario to fix the error.

 massaging the numbers You've probably seen the Sal Khan video that long story short says each death means 800 infections 20 days before the death.  It's a crude metric but it's the least bad we have to go on right now if we want any kind of real picture of Coronavirus infections in Canada instead of the silliness we're getting as official statistics.

Canada has 21 deaths, with the first occurring on March 11.  Back that up 20 days and you can posit the first 800 infections on February 20.  That was 30 days ago.  Given the posited doubling rate of five days, 30/5=6 so that 1 death could mean 800 doubled 6 times or 102,400  infections today.

The 21 deaths weren't all on the same day, but assuming they were gives an upper bound for posited number of infections under this crude model.  That works out to 2,150,400 infections, or 5.812% of Canada's population.

Working backwards, if Khan's assumption of a 1% death rate holds, we're talking an upper bound of 2,150,400/100 or 21,500 deaths in no sooner than another 20 days, by April 12.

I'm not trying to be alarmist here, just trying to cope with the Yes, Minister bad ganja I keep getting from Ontario reporting partial test results from some of the tests done 12-15 days ago.  If anyone can make a positive contribution to that, please do.

 The Ontario death numbers are low for most of the population. Is this because of low prevalence? Or because COVID is just not that lethal? Our deaths per 100k are less than 5 for each age group other than the 70+ group. New York has 127 per 100k for the 45-64 group as comparison so I wanted to figure out why that is the case.

Firstly, I’ve made a bunch of (reasonable) assumptions:

* All fatalities in Ontario due to COVID have been recorded by the provincial numbers, in particular for the sub 70 age group.
* The life tables published by Statistics Canada are accurate
* The population numbers published by the Province of Ontario are accurate
 

**Approach:**

* Estimate the number of cases of COVID n Ontario for each age group based on different prevalence percentages and the provincial populations. E.g. if we assume that the prevalence of COVID is 1% in Ontario, then there would be 1,778,133*1% = 17,813 people aged 60-69 that have COVID
* Gross up the fatality numbers based on the completed cases (fatal+resolved) e.g. if 75 people have died but only 75% of cases have been completed, my fatality number is 100 fatalities based on the cases active today.
* Fatality rate = [Fatalities reported by Ontario / (Population * Prevalence percentage)] / Completion percentage
* Compare the fatality rate to the Ontario life table probability of death in the next year based on their age, published by Statistics Canada -  For each age group, I averaged the individual probability for each of the years.

**Findings**

* [Link to calculations](

* For people younger than 70 years old, if the current prevalence of COVID in Ontario is &gt;1%, then the probability of dying of COVID is less than the probability of dying of anything at all in the year.

* For people that older than 70+, COVID is more lethal than normal if the COVID prevalence in those age groups is up to 2%

* Fatality rates that are greater than the life table fatality are highlighted in blue

There are a bunch of numbers thrown around for prevalence numbers from 2% in California to 15% in New York so I would say that 1% is a fairly conservative estimate given the level of interprovince travel in Ontario.

 Sask. father attributes son’s death to COVID-19 rules: ‘This shouldn’t have happened’ 
++++++++++
 Officially Canada has 34,657 COVID-19 Active Cases. In reality, about half have most likely already recovered but are underreported. More info inside... If you look at this graph: [ something strange pops out. 

While the daily number of New Cases has been trending down since late April (blue line in blue graph to left) the number of Active Cases (top of yellow bar in main graph) keeps trending up and is at peak today. Normally, at this stage of the disease, one would expect both graphs to generally look similar, and this is indeed the case in most provinces (example: [two peaks in AB]( [right tail in NS]( and [Ontario's recent "tick up"]( 

[Quebec is different]( While the number of daily New Cases peaked in early May the number of Active Cases keeps trending up and is at peak today. As of today, Quebec's reported 29,460 Active Cases account for 85% of Canada's total reported Active Cases.

Quantifying what is visually noticeable, we can take the reported number of Active Cases in each province, and then check how many days back we have to go accumulating New Cases in order to fulfill that number. We get the following:

|Province|\# of days back accumulating New Cases required to fulfill # of Active Cases|
|:-|:-|
|NS|11|
|ON|11|
|AB|17|
|SK|17|
|BC|20|
|MB|26|
|NL|26|
|QC|38|

Assuming Quebec recovery numbers are underreported, the question is by how much?

One way to guess is to use the above table and compute the number of Active Cases based on x number of days back for New Cases. In the last 26 days Quebec reported 19,743 New Cases, in the last 20 it reported 14,271, in the last 17 it reported 11,612 and in the last 11 it reported only 7,178.

The MB, NL number (26) will yield 33% reduction in Active Cases in Quebec resulting in 28% reduction of Active Cases Canada wide. This is significant, but the reduction is most likely even larger. Both [MB]( and [NL]( are about to contain the disease displaying a long tail to the right. The few Active Cases there seem to either be medically or administratively hard to clear from the register. Quebec is in a different stage of the disease.

Using ON and NS number (11)  will yield 76% reduction in Active Cases in Quebec resulting in 64% reduction of Active Cases Canada wide. Erring on the side of caution and using AB and SK number (17)  will yield 61% reduction in Active Cases in Quebec resulting in 51% reduction of Active Cases Canada wide.

Hence, half of Canada's COVID-19 Active Cases have most likely already recovered but are underreported.

You may have COVID-19 and you may not even know it or have any symptoms. Potential transmission from asymptomatic persons has been reported. COVID-19 has very limited negative impact on children, however; children are literally virus transmitters during this Global Pandemic.

This is not the time for children to be at playgrounds. 

This is not the time to have your children interact with other children.

**The virus has been detected in asymptomatic persons.** Pan et al. report on a family cluster where a mother and a child were both asymptomatic but had positive RT-PCR results \[7\] . Hoehl et al. (2020) also report that two out of 114 Germans who were evacuated from Hubei province on 1 Feb 2020 tested positive in two throat swab specimens by RT-PCR and presented no symptoms \[8\]. The two persons were isolated in a hospital in Frankfurt where a faint rash and minimal pharyngitis was observed in one of them. Both patients were still well and afebrile 7 days after admission. 

Potential infectivity was confirmed by virus culture. Zou et al. 2020 report that the viral load of asymptomatic patients was similar to symptomatic patients, **indicating a transmission potential of asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic patients** \[6\]. The study reports that patients with few or no symptoms had modest levels of detectable viral RNA in the oropharynx for at least 5 days \[6\]. 

**Potential transmission from asymptomatic persons has been reported.** Bai et al. 2020 report a familial cluster of five COVID-19 patients hospitalised with fever and respiratory symptoms that had contact before onset of symptoms with an asymptomatic family member, a young 20-year-old woman, after her return from Wuhan. **She remained asymptomatic for the entire duration of laboratory and clinical monitoring (19 days) \[9\].**

 Help me understand the government math The slides the government put out today have an Infection Fatality Ratio of 1.17% (22000/1,879,000)

The low end estimates have 1-2 million infections, and 11000-22000 deaths. (2.5% and 5% of population infected)

We are at 20,000 infections and 500 deaths and expected to peak in about a week or so.

Does this mean we are expecting 60,000 or so lab confirmed cases, and a ratio of 16-1 of missed infections?

If so, would this not drive the CFR ratio down drastically when converting to the IFR?

Or are we going to have a million lab confirmed infections? (Almost 6 more doublings, and 25000 dead @ CFR of 2.5%)

In the middle ground, which seems to be where the numbers point, there are 500,000 lab confirmed infections @ 2.5% CFR. And only 1 missed infection for every lab confirmed, which doubles the cases to 1 million and halfs the CFR to 1.25% when it is translated into an IFR.

In this situation, we are expecting 4.5 doublings still to come. (20k-40k-80k-160k-320k-half,480k)

 Map showing outbreak locations in B.C. I don't buy the whole "we won't officially disclose the location information of confirmed cases due to privacy concerns" argument. People should be alerted when there is an outbreak near their own community. So I started marking up a google map with the locations or whereabouts of confirmed cases/outbreaks that are reported in the news for BC: 

[

For a certain location, you can click on the marker to find the link to the news article about the outbreak or number of confirmed cases there. The map is far from perfect and is still work in progress (mainly Metro Vancouver data so far). Suggestions for new data points backed by reliable sources are welcome in the comments.

 Late Night Brain Was Thinking... Random thought came to mind about COVID-19. We have an infection, recovery and death rate but not one for complications. All the doubters seem to think death is not the worst outcome of having Covid. But would some that are on the fence rethink that when they realize the serious  side effects. Here are just some I can think of...

- Loss of taste
- Debilitating exhaustion
- Clotting
- Lung Damage
- Breathing problems 
- Immune overreaction 
- Etc.

I mean with polio or small pox, people were just as concerned with physical complications as they did death. So if someone doubted saw a number like “9/10 of recovered COVID-19 patients had one of these complications”, would they think differently.

Just some food for thought.
