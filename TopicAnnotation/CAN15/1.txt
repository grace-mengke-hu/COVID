 How are you avoiding infection during regular health care? My specialist appointments are in a large hospital and involve riding some very crowded elevators, as well as extended waiting time in a crowded ground-floor elevator bank.

My family doctor shares office space with a walk-in clinic and the waiting rooms are always crowded.

In both of those cases the risk of infection seems unacceptably high.  I've suspended all further health care appointments for the time being, as health care facility waiting rooms and hospitals are the number one places to catch a transmissible infection.

How are you coping in terms of your health care?  (I can understand that some people are not in a position simply to stop seeing doctors.)

 A list of public boat launches that are going to be open on May 16, 2020 The Premier announced on May 14/20 that effective May 16/20 marinas and boat launches may open. I got in touch with one facility in Belwood, and was told that, since they were not informed by the government prior to the announcement they will not be ready this weekend to prepare their docks. 

Does anyone know of any facilities that will be open on Lake Simco?
