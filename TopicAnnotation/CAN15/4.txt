 Covid vaccine eli5 If people can get Covid multiple times and beat it, how would a vaccination work? Isn’t a vaccine as if you “got it” and beat it and have the antibodies? Couldn’t people just get Covid again after the vaccine?

 Dozens of Nurses Exposed to COVID-19 at St. Mary’s General Hospital; ONA calls for expedited testing, collaboration with employer to ensure nurses, patients are safe 

"Registered nurses were exposed while caring for a patient who presented at the emergency department and was screened for influenza, but not COVID-19,” says ONA President Vicki McKenna, RN. “Nurses were exposed as they performed emergency medical procedures on the patient that made the virus borne by air; the patient was not isolated. And worst of all, nurses were unable to access N95 respirators when they performed the procedures, as their employer strongly discourages nurses wearing them.”

McKenna says that more nurses were exposed to COVID-19 by a co-worker; several nurses have subsequently become sick.

“This is a clear example of what should never happen in health care,” says McKenna."

 Why are we so confident we’ll create a vaccine for COVID-19? From what the media is reporting, we’ll have a COVID-19 vaccine anywhere between the fall and 12-18 months from now. To the best of my knowledge, we’ve never been successful in creating a vaccine for any coronavirus (ie: MERS, SARS, common cold etc.). Even the flu vaccine is only 40-60% effective. Why are we so confident we’ll be able to create a vaccine for COVID-19?
