 My Boss wants us to come in for a meeting. I got an email from our boss saying he wants to have a meeting about getting back to work. I live in London, and our business only has 6-7 people (but is non-essential).

Do you think I should attend? I'm not sure if it's alright to do so yet.

 Employment insurance due to restaurant closure. Hi, 

I work in a restaurant which closed temporarily due to the pandemic... trying to flatten the curve. I'm just wondering, if I can apply for employment insurance and if so, should I just do so as normal on the service Canada website? Or is there a specific link/site to go to if you were temporarily laid off due to covid19? 

Any help is appreciated. Thanks!!
