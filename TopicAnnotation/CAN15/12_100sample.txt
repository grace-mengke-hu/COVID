 Harvey's restaurant no longer providing individually wrapped straws. They now have a plastic sippy lid, that is handled by the staff, during a pandemic... I don't know if this is true for all Harvey's, but I just went through the drive-through at Leslie &amp; Davis in Newmarket. Instead of an individually wrapped paper straw (covid safe and eco-friendly), I was given a plastic sippy lid for my drink. It wasn't wrapped either, it was placed on my drink cup by the person working the window.  
I don't know who thought this was a good idea, but I'm pretty disappointed right now. I will be contacting head office after work to let them know.

The Clipper represents a massive threat to BC resident's health and it needs to be shut down. It serves as a direct link from Seattle to Victoria and Vancouver (by means of BC ferries). I'm blown away by this - a single company risking public health in TWO COUNTRIES.

Upon entry in Canada, are there any restrictions related to which countries you've visited (whether in-transit or not) in recent times? Is it possible that I am denied entry since I am going via Frankfurt? 

I looked at all the travel related websites from the government online but couldn't find anything. Any help is appreciated! Thanks! :)

 New study shows air quality in Toronto has improved dramatically in recent weeks - BlogTO [

The impacts the current pandemic is having on Toronto are huge, and one might be that [air quality in the city has actually improved]( since the lockdown started.

University of Toronto Engineering Professor Greg Evans, together with his team at [Southern Ontario Centre for Atmospheric Aerosol Research]( , have been monitoring the concentrations of a wide range of air pollutants in downtown Toronto for over a decade.

"Our preliminary data indicates that air quality has improved dramatically in Toronto since the pandemic shutdown started," said Evans.

"For example, the concentrations of two traffic-related air pollutants, nitrogen oxides and ultrafine particles, have decreased in downtown Toronto to almost half their concentrations prior to the shutdown."

Data taken from the 2003 SARS-CoV-1 virus (SARS) outbreak suggests that wind increased the virus' propagation while high air pollution doubled mortality in certain places.

An early [study from Harvard]( shows what [many already suspect]( that death from COVID-19 was substantially higher in counties that have had poorer air quality over the previous 16 years.

"Emissions have decreased in an unprecedented way across Canada and the U.S., which has provided an opportunity to better understand the many sources of air pollution and how these sources influence air quality," said Evans.

"Fortunately, Canada in general has very good air quality, which may work to our advantage during this pandemic. The reduction in emissions due to the shutdown will further improve this advantage."

"While it’s much too early to know if this improvement in air quality is helping to reduce hospitalization, people may still want to err on the side of caution and do what they can to further reduce emissions and their own exposure. This might include limiting their use of gas-powered cars, BBQs, leaf blowers and lawn mowers," he said.

Evans said his hope is that when the [economy ramps up again]( in about a year, "our country will also work with and follow the guidance of Canada’s experts in climate change and sustainability."

 They say viruses know no borders! Listening to our leaders i constantly hear "viruses know no borders"

How them would you explain this graphic? I kinda see a well defined border here, don't you?



I know some of you will think that Canadian are so great that we did a much better job at keeping it away that Americans did, and i would agree with you a tiny bit.

But, I personally think we haven't really started to test enough yet.

The second Americans started have more test capacity the numbers surged. Loose logic? Maybe but i find the coincidence hard to believe.

On a related subject, see my petition on closing borders now rather than sorry.

 Covid-19: How about those who still working during covid 19 Hi guys, 

I saw news about benefits for those lost their income due to covid 19. I am glad to hear that they got support. However, as a worker in supply chain industry, i am concerned if we have any support at all? I am working for a transportation company and supply chain is considered essential. We are working twice as hard as usual to make sure all the stores which are still open have enough inventory. We are facing the risks of getting the virus and still no support so far. No extra pay from employer or any support from government. Many of us got paid just a little higher than minimum and now, since the CERB will be implemented, do you think it is fair to work and got paid few extra bucks than those who stays at home?
++++++++++
 My company (Ontario) is refusing to let people work from home unless the government mandates a shutdown. Our critical business does not require anyone to be in the office. The job does involve semi-regular client interactions. But a lot of our clients have already begun working remotely and cancelling meetings. IMO this is terribly irresponsible. I don't even know how to argue with this level of selfishness. 

Company size is between 500-1000 people. I imagine there are other offices just like this. If the government doesn't take proper action we'll have no chance to limit the spread. I can social distance myself all I want in my private life. If I have to come in daily to a shared office with a bunch of people, it erases most of my efforts.

 PSA: Criminally Irresponsible Company Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

I   am writing this with the intention of getting advice for my next  steps,  and letting the public know about what is happening at my  workplace,  and how it will affect them.

&amp;#x200B;

I   work at a large commercial moving company based in Toronto.  They have  no intention of  shutting down.  Technically, it has been deemed an  essential business  (transportation), but 90% of businesses also seem to  be essential in  Ontario.  I don't think society will crumble if some  big company can't  move their headquarters from one high rise to  another.  Do you?

&amp;#x200B;

They   have put in place no policies to protect the movers.  There is no PTO.    People are scared of calling in sick lest they receive a cut in  hours.   Full-time workers have no benefits.  We don't receive hazard  pay.  We  don't even get overtime.  There has been no change in policy  to protect  workers.  Nothing.  Well, they did give us nitrile gloves  and a big  bottle of hand sanitizer at the dispatch.

&amp;#x200B;

Now how does this affect you?

&amp;#x200B;

On   a busy day we have around 50 people working.  Those 50 people will   interact face to face among each other throughout the week.  Including   those 50 initial movers, our company also has around 30-40 office   workers, 10 warehouse workers, and a plethora of third party truck   drivers coming in and out and in and out.  Some of these third party   truck drivers are also making deliveries to New York state (20,000 cases   at time of writing).

&amp;#x200B;

Back   to those 50 initial movers now.  We touch random surfaces all day, we   interact with clients, we make deliveries all over southern Ontario.    Imagine if one person at this company was sick.  Imagine how many people   would become infected in a matter of two weeks.  These movers are   people who go to your grocery stores, live in your communities, they   might even be in your social bubble.  If not the movers then someone   they've interacted with.

&amp;#x200B;

Regardless   of all of this, the owner and upper management has been fighting tooth   and nail to stay open, and to take on as many jobs as possible.  And  for  what?  Money.  We are humans, not a pieces of meat.

&amp;#x200B;

This   company is literally risking public health and safety.  The owner   doesn't care about us.  The management doesn't care about us.  People   will get sick, and God forbid die from the actions (or inaction) of the   upper echelon of this company.

&amp;#x200B;

I am very reluctant to share anymore information, but if I can initiate a meaningful course of action I will gladly share more.

&amp;#x200B;

What can I do for now?  Any advice?

 Should companies start a policy related to travelling and self - quarantine? My friend’s boss visited Italy a few weeks ago and made it out before the northern region first being quarantined. My friend told me he immediately came back to office the next week. There is also one colleague coming back to the office right after visiting California. Though our HR told him that in case of feeling illness he should stop coming to work, yet it is said the virus is contagious within incubation period which can last from 1 to 14 days depending on individual. Should the companies or business start a policy regarding the employee’s travelling? If someone in a workplace contracted the virus and develop severe syndrome or their family would be infected and go through some real threat, who is responsible for this? Especially you could be sure of the source is one of your colleagues just come back from a trip.

 The Company I work for is Essential and not following Public Health Recommendations, what should I do? I am the health and safety representative for a medium sized print and web company in Ontario, and am currently working from home. Today, on our Teams chat, the workers still working on location posted a birthday gathering for one of the sales people (these gatherings were tradition pre-covid-19). After reading up on the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act, it appears that this may have been breaking the law... essential business are required to follow guidelines under Schedule 3 of the act, notably: **1.(2) The person responsible for a place of business that is open shall operate the business in compliance with the advice, recommendations and instructions of public health officials, including any advice, recommendations or instructions on physical distancing, cleaning or disinfecting.**

I brought this to everyones attention, and to my employer... beyond that is there anything I should do? What is the enforcement of these requirements? What are the penalties? I've been having trouble finding this information. I assume people are just ignorant of the requirements, and that is possibly my fault as health and safety representative, but I just got back from a parental leave that conveniently coincided with the outbreak. Can anyone offer advice? Thanks.

 Childrens' COVID severe outcome tracking in Canada I understand that this is not a very positive topic but I wanted to create this thread as there are some worrying trends in the data that point to more cases than we know about.

Firstly, there are sporadic reports of MIS-C and there doesn't seem to be anyone tracking these cases.

Secondly, the deaths are not being reported officially in a timely manner.  We know one death occurred in August a [19 year old in Quebec]( however, that death is not reflected in the official numbers.  Data from [ shows an additional 2-3 deaths in Quebec in 2-17 year olds from April/May posted in the past week and 1 MIS-C case in Alberta.  Ontario has a report of a child who died [with COVID but not of COVID](  There have been reports of children drowning in the bathtub from febrile seizures in the US with diagnosed/undiagnosed COVID.  There is also [an official death in a child with COVID in Ontario]( the only death in the National system and the report goes to great lengths to ensure all we know is the child was under 10.

With all this data, there could be 4-6 deaths in children under 20 in Canada with close to 11,000 positive tests.

The public needs to know what the real story is here so if anyone has any further insight or links to articles, please post it.

During this time my job is secured but his is not.
He is 100%commission and obviously nobody is buying anything right now but hes still employed. 

There is rumors that his company will be closing for a bit due to covid 19 so what are his options?

If he is technically still employed but they are closed can he apply for ei?i was confused reading it all. He wont have an roe if they just close for a few weeks.

It doesnt seem he qualifies for the emergency benefit because hes not sick or caring for someone that is sick.

Does he just not get anything? Should he just ask for a layoff so he can for sure get ei? (Company has already laid off a few people)

&gt; As the world continues to be impacted by COVID-19 in a rapid and evolving way, telecommunications networks are not immune from its effect.
&gt; 
&gt; The increased demand by people staying home, working remotely, or just using the internet for more entertainment as Canada hunkers down, is driving capacity on the networks and will likely push them to the limits over the coming weeks. Thousands of network providers around the world are bracing for, and some already experiencing, these effects – with some seeing record breaking levels already. Start has been working on augmenting capacity with our networking partners, such as Bell, Cogeco and Rogers, but these networks too can become strained in some areas and may experience slow-downs while everyone scrambles to address the issues.

 Do you think alternate ways such as multiple rapid tests and a smaller quarantine period is a viable solution to the current 14 day period? Air Canada with McMaster University is testing these alternative methods which include rapid testing and perhaps a smaller quarantine period as an alternate to the current 14 day period to increase travel. They've already completed 15,000 voluntary tests and continue to collect more data to present a case for the government. They are also piloting a similar program at Edmonton Airports to see if travel can be opened up more. 

Do you guys think these are viable methods to the current 14 day quarantine or is it wishful thinking? If so, how long before it would be implemented?

I supposed quarantine fatigue has officially set in for me where I'd like to visit friends and family in the US. They're only 4 hours away but its on the other side of the border. The point of the 14 day quarantine is to deter travelers which is working but its officially started weighing down on me personally. 

Its the Thanksgiving blues right now and hopefully it won't extent to the holiday blues in December...

 What happened to SARS? This whole thing got me wondering: what happened to SARS? Does the virus still exist, and if so, why aren’t we concerned about it anymore? 

I never had SARS so presumably I’m just as susceptible now as I was in 2003. And I’m now realizing how concerned I *should have been* in 2003. 

What would it take for COVID to become a back-of-the-mind virus that nobody’s really concerned about anymore?

 COVID Solution ? - Borrowing Time to save us from the economic fall out of quarantine. **If we stop everything, including the clock would that not give us time to quarantine comfortably and prevent further spread of the virus while also serving to preserve the economy?**

Imagine a mandatory, global 14 day quarantine, starting April 1st. At midnight, the clock would stop. 14 days will pass, then the clock starts up again and it's April 2nd. 

Time is money, with the clock stopped time become "free". Or in this case borrowed. 

Thanks to the leap year, we can pay back at day, after 14 leap years our clock would be synced back to the standard. This effectively spreads the economic burden of 2 weeks off for everyone over 56 years. 

This is a pretty far fetched idea. I'm interested in discussing the potential pros and cons.

 *Ontario* My spouse is awaiting results , but I can go to work? 
I hope this question is allowed here, I  think it related to the possible spreading of covid-19.

Sunday my spouse started feeling sick , light cough, general muscle aches and fatigue, alternating between feeling feverish and chilly. 

He got a test monday. Asked over the phone if I should get a test, they said I could not because I have no symptoms.

From what I read online I don't need to isolate until/unless it is confirmed. They told him 2 -5 days to receive results.

So on the one hand , I am pleased we only have to worry about the money lost from the few sick days he has taken, on the other hand I am worried about potentially having it and spreading it to the vulnerable people I work with.

But am I correctly interpreting the most recent advice regarding when to test or isolate ? That is what I am reading for Canada and Ontario online, and others tell me every work place is different with what they allow. My supervisor didn't reply to my text when I said my spouse is sick and awaiting results , so I am assuming that means they expect me at work tomorrow ( by tomorrow I mean in 2 hours lol) hubby just checked his results an hour ago , no results yet.

Thanks for listening to my question-turned-rant.

++++++++++
 Why are we keeping non essential factories and warehouses open? This is totally irresponsible here in ontario.  Do we really need kitchen cabinetry and granite counter tops at this time?  A lot of low wage workers are carpooling to get to these jobs.  Social distancing is basically non existent in these places.  One bathroom for many employees that is cleaned infrequently.  Small break rooms with no staggering of breaks.  Shared tools, no one taking precautions with management in denial and penalizing workers if they don't show.   This is a perfect disease vector.  It needs to be shut down.

 Positive news: Lowest % growth in cases across Canada today (3.1%) Three days ago I posted that Canada reported the lowest %growth till then (3.3%).

Today, with 1526 new cases, it's the new lowest % increase (3.1%) we've seen since the outbreak began (since 100 cases). For the last four days, the % growth has been 3.3%, 3.4%, 3.4% and 3.1% (today); overall lowest numbers yet. Hopefully this declines further.

Some of my friends were barely even working before the covid crisis and are saying they're going to apply and it just sounds unfair to me that they would get this money while i struggle to make ends meet in a grocery store? Idk.

 Grocery Stores - Potential major infections zones unless action is taken Many grocery stores like Zehrs are implementing good ways to help reduce the spread of the virus, like providing sanitation stations in the front entrance so costumers can sanitize their cart and hands upon entering and leaving the store. While a great step, one of the main issues is that you can spread the virus days before you get any symptoms (and sometimes none at all). While customers can practice social distancing, cashiers mainly, and stuff are still exposed to hundreds, and sometimes thousands of people per shift - greatly increasing their chances of getting the virus, and then very easily spread the virus to the customers when they are asymptomatic, and potentially cause many new clusters.   


Staff and employees of grocery stores (and other business, but grocery being the main priority) should be wearing PPE alongside following the already existing sanitation rules.I hope this is implemented BEFORE the lock down is enforced, i believe it  would make in impact in helping flattening the curve before things get severely out of hand.

 A change in behaviour This is a link to the Ontario Occupational Health and Safety Act.  [ 

It's fairly long, links to numerous regulations under the act, and most importantly it clearly defines what employers and employees must do, by law, in order to help maintain safe work environments. 

Why can we not develop something similar for Covid? A document that provides guidance for workplaces to help minimize Covid spread while we restart our economy. There are so many simple things each workplace can do, many at very little cost, that will help tremendously. A living document that is updated daily, through consultation with health experts, industry experts, etc. and that employers and employees can rely on, to me seems like it could help tremendously. 

&amp;#x200B;

For example every business has high use touch points, doors, elevators, equipment, etc. A simple tissue box on the wall with a bin on the floor and these touch points become much safer. Many businesses have common lunch rooms or other common areas with poor ventilation, stagnant airflow, etc. Mandating mask wearing, even home made, staggering usage, mandating number of people allowed per room, moving meetings to outside, we have hundreds of solutions that could be tailored to individual industries that will help make our workplaces safer. 

&amp;#x200B;

In my opinion our health experts, our industry experts, our governments, they need to be exploring this. They need to come up with detailed guidelines for as many industries as possible so that:

A. Employers have a reference to identify best practices

B. Employees have a reference to bring to employers

C. Non compliance becomes enforceable by law so that everyone is working towards the same goal.

 Atten: Justin Trudeau &amp; Doug Ford, HELP IS NEEDED!! I can only speak for myself but I'm certain many other Canadians feel the same.

I am here begging you to take a much more drastic approach to fighting this virus.  What we are currently doing is certainly not enough and will not be enough going forward.  My #1 concern is for my health and the well being for my family friends and my fellow Canadians.

While I understand the economy is in need of attention its far more important to keep the focus on our people.

The "essential services list" is far to broad.  I could make up reasons to justify keeping many places open as it would be essential.  I would suggest we don't look for what is essential but rather what is CRITICAL FOR SURVIVAL. 

Another huge issue, especially where I work is there is still no urgency regarding covid19.  The mentality is still business as usual.  There is a lack of sanitizing, no strict rules regarding visitors, social distancing is often hard to maintain, and to put it all on the table I feel like the health of the employees are not being considered at all.  I work in a punch and die shop that hardly deserves the title as essential, and work with all kinds of metals all day long.  None of which is being cleaned when being brought in.  We know that the virus can live on these surfaces and yet my work is not doing anything to keep us safe.  Without the proper message sent from our leaders to businesses they will continue to do nothing and risk our health.

At the very least, if we and other business are required to stay open, I need for my government to order that employers provides a clean and safe environment. 

Include simple things like:
1.  cleaning all doorknobs at least twice a day
2.  no visitors
3.  clean all eating surfaces and workstations 
4.  bathrooms should be cleaned daily if not several times a day.
5. any outside materials being shipped in should be cleaned prior to going on the shop floor
6. promote social distancing at work.
7. have testing available to ensure no one is infected

These are just some idea.  Ultimately I truly feel like we shouldn't be operational during this period as our work is simply not critical for survival during this epidemic .

I hope this can be read by the powers that be at some point because we need you help in order to get through this.  Our leaders are asking for us to do our part and now I am asking for you to do yours.

Thanks in advance!

For the last few weeks I've had to start taking an Uber to get to work because its that much faster then the TTC and just better for my stomach and mental health.

**Some data (hints) to consider:**
* Canada has a population of 37.5 million; 
* Today, March 27, is "Day 60" (Patient One in Canada was Jan 27). 
* Canada's first death was March 8 (+40 days from Patient One). 
* The "Intervention" line represents when a change in the Reproduction Number (R0) occurred. Typically this coincides with the Government imposing restrictions to reduce the Reproduction Number. For example on March 18 (Day 50) the Canada/US border closed. So the Intervention line should (likely) reside somewhere in the range of Day 40 - Day 70 period. 
* As of this morning (Day 60) Canada now has 4,018 "Confirmed Active Cases". However, I would caution that the real total of Exposed + Infected + Hospitalized is undoubtedly higher than this value. This is due to both the unavailability of testing and the lag time that exists with the current tests. 
* As of this morning Canada has [conducted 164,564 tests and have 39 confirmed deaths.](

 Covid vs Coffee in the office Hello  I am back to work for the first time this year, it's a call center and we have to wear masks all day for 3 months of training.   

Are people in offices these days allowed to remove their masks every other moment to sip their coffee?  

Removing the mask constantly like that, I could see as an issue.
Not having my coffee would also be an issue.

I need coffee at work.   NEED.

How does this work with wearing a mask?
Thank you.

 PSA: Criminally Irresponsible Company Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

I  am writing this with the intention of getting advice for my next steps,  and letting the public know about what is happening at my workplace,  and how it will affect them.

&amp;#x200B;

I  work at a large commercial moving company based in Toronto.  They have no intention of  shutting down.  Technically, it has been deemed an essential business  (transportation), but 90% of businesses also seem to be essential in  Ontario.  I don't think society will crumble if some big company can't  move their headquarters from one high rise to another.  Do you?

&amp;#x200B;

They  have put in place no policies to protect the movers.  There is no PTO.   People are scared of calling in sick lest they receive a cut in hours.   Full-time workers have no benefits.  We don't receive hazard pay.  We  don't even get overtime.  There has been no change in policy to protect  workers.  Nothing.  Well, they did give us nitrile gloves and a big  bottle of hand sanitizer at the dispatch.

&amp;#x200B;

Now how does this affect you?

&amp;#x200B;

On  a busy day we have around 50 people working.  Those 50 people will  interact face to face among each other throughout the week.  Including  those 50 initial movers, our company also has around 30-40 office  workers, 10 warehouse workers, and a plethora of third party truck  drivers coming in and out and in and out.  Some of these third party  truck drivers are also making deliveries to New York state (20,000 cases  at time of writing).

&amp;#x200B;

Back  to those 50 initial movers now.  We touch random surfaces all day, we  interact with clients, we make deliveries all over southern Ontario.   Imagine if one person at this company was sick.  Imagine how many people  would become infected in a matter of two weeks.  These movers are  people who go to your grocery stores, live in your communities, they  might even be in your social bubble.  If not the movers then someone  they've interacted with.

&amp;#x200B;

Regardless  of all of this, the owner and upper management has been fighting tooth  and nail to stay open, and to take on as many jobs as possible.  And for  what?  Money.  We are humans, not a pieces of meat.

&amp;#x200B;

This  company is literally risking public health and safety.  The owner  doesn't care about us.  The management doesn't care about us.  People  will get sick, and God forbid die from the actions (or inaction) of the  upper echelon of this company.

&amp;#x200B;

I am very reluctant to share anymore information, but if I can initiate a meaningful course of action I will gladly share more.  

&amp;#x200B;

What can I do for now?  Any advice?

 (Quebec) A little help, maybe? Hello! Before the pandemic hit, I was job searching, and even closer to when everything went on basically a lockdown, I was hired for a job. I was supposed to start work on the 4th of this month, it has been now pushed to the 20th (I was hired for a fish plant that packages crab) and it may be pushed even further.   


My mother, whom I share a house with,

 (yes, i'm 20, though I have my highschool leaving. I am anxiety ridden, diagnosed and medicated for it, the same goes for ADD. I feel much more safe living with a family member, and my mother needs the emotional support, she had gotten out of an emotionally abusive marriage that went on for 16 years so I've stuck with her since then) 

and pay about half of rent for, has lost hours of her job at the airport she was working at. I know that people who have lost their jobs due to COVID-19 are getting 2000 a month, however, i'm really worried and stressed that I don't apply. I want to help mom not stress as much, and I can just see how she's struggling. We already are on a very low income, and this hit us hard.   


Any advice on what I can do (the little bits I have been doing is pushing out more art commissions, though I never get enough for that) to help my mother out?   


Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you, and stay safe out there!! &lt;3

 As we reopen our societies we must be vigilant about preventing it's spread with even more stringent rules and procedures than are in place now If we want life in BC to be near-normal any time soon, we need to carefully monitor people who return after leaving the province and those visiting. The border with USA must remain *very* well monitored. Travel to and from USA, Quebec and Ontario must to be limited and subject to the same quarantine rules as are in place now for international travellers. This means a **mandatory 14 day quarantine**. If you can't follow these necessary *obligations,* send someone else. These protocols should only be lessened when other jurisdictions get control of the COVID-19 virus in their locale.

These restrictions must be in place or we will suffer with this limitation of society for a long time.

 Should I apply to CERB? I'm probably one of many, but I'm a student who was hoping to get work after I graduate, but with this coronavirus stuff going on, places I could apply to with my type of degree aren't considered essential. I've tried applying to grocery stores and other places still open, but I haven't heard anything back. So I applied to CERB and have now received a note in the mail asking for more paperwork to be submitted. I guess my question is, is it worth it?

I'm not sure how the whole CERB thing works, I admit I should've done better research before I applied, but I couldn't find anything great. Will my taxes be worse/more confusing after this? Do I have to pay this back? Is there a way to cancel this application at all? I'm more nervous now about it than when I first applied! 

Thanks anyone who helps me out!
