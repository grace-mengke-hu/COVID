We are doing this because there will be a lot of Canadian deaths if we don't.  My **Estimation of Canadian deaths are between 114,000 to 798,000.**

&amp;#x200B;

If we assume *30-70% rate of population infection, 1-3% death rate, and \~38 million* Canadians it breaks down as follows;

If the population infection rate is 30% of 38 million Canadians, 11.4 million people will be infected. If death rate is at 1%, that is 114,000 Canadians dead.

If the population infection rate is 70% of 38 million Canadians, 26.6 million people will be infected. If death rate is at 3%, this is 798,000 Canadians dead.
