 April 30th 2020 The approach Canada is taking is wrong and in 6 weeks we will see the consequences first hand. Many Canadian provinces are trying to flatten the curve, delay hospital presentation, so that our systems can cope. While this is a fantastic and very important measure, and it WILL save lives, economically this will be a disaster. 

Current measures cannot contain, they can only slow. We are hoping therapeutics and other treatments will quickly be developed that lesson severity and will allow us to live with COVID-19, transition back to our old normal.  But what if they aren't. What if a percentage of the population are out of luck and not catching the virus is their only salvation. 

This post goes into detail about our need for an end game and I wanted to take it a step further at expand on why action is needed NOW and what our lives will look like in 6 weeks. 

 [ 

China, Taiwan, Singapore have all beaten this virus. Yes the numbers don't show it yet but each country has a system in place, the infrastructure to fight back, and they are continuously innovating and building. They declared WAR against COVID-19 and they are winning. What this means is that in 6 weeks, 8 weeks, sometime in the future the virus will be gone from these countries. Yes gone. Their borders will be closed and they will have extremely strict measures in place for entry, for trade, so that anyone entering does not spread.  Sure there will be breaches but that system will catch them as everyone will realize strict measures beat a country wide quarantines every time. 

Thus by end of April, while Canada and much of North America are dealing with the first peak of virus, while our hospital systems are breaking, China, Taiwan, Singapore, they will begin living normal lives. Restaurants will be open, businesses will be flourishing, nightlife will be active and COVID-19 will have been eliminated from those countries. Not stalled due to warmer weather, not waiting for a second peak in the fall, ELIMINATED. 

This is what Canada is missing. Economically we cannot sustain 6, 8, 12 months of semi measures. We cannot live with this virus in our society while we wait for a vaccine. The world is changing and the countries that beat this virus will become paradise while everyone else struggles to maintain this "new normal". Businesses will shutdown, unemployment will skyrocket, and we will be living in quarantine until treatment or heard immunity take hold. The economical solution is to kill this virus. Nationalize our approach, declare war, and do what is necessary, whatever the cost, to eliminate COVID-19 from our country. Anything less and this new normal will not go away and in 6 weeks we will be looking across the ocean wishing we acted differently.

 Thoughts on provincial travel? I was wondering whether people thought domestic travel right now was irresponsible?  

I've noticed quite a few people I know have recently visited family in different provinces. I've been finding it difficult and mentally draining being in my home province at the moment - I don't have much family left in Canada, and most my friends and my partner in BC.

I've been desperately wanting to go on a trip back to BC for a few weeks, but I can't bring myself to do it because it seems selfish and perhaps next year might be a better time (although I was reading reports of how we might be dealing with the pandemic for another 2 years...). Was wondering where other people generally stood on the matter?

 Six cases in Ontario in last 5 days, representing 17% of all Ontario cases, do not meet current Ontario COVID-19 case definition for screening Current Ontario case definition: [

March 10, 2020

* Switzerland (1 case)

March 9, 2020

* Germany (1 case)

March 8, 2020

* France (1 case)
* USA (2 cases)

March 6, 2020

* USA (1 case)

Why are politicians and leaders not being pressed on this? I feel as if we are missing a golden opportunity to limit community spread. At this point, any travel outside of Canada within 14 days of symptom onset should be screened.

Why is it that some hospitals have been permitted to test outside of the case definition? I work in health care, and public health has rejected several physician requests for testing because cases do not meet current case definition in Ontario.

Of note, Alberta as of March 6 is now screening all travel outside of Canada within 14 days of symptom onset: [

 [QUESTION] I am a Personal Support Worker for a disabled client. Is my client required to wear a mask for the duration of my shift? I wear all required PPE and take appropriate COVID precautions. She does not wear a mask during my shifts (8 hours). She also does not wear a mask when her other support workers come in. I've asked her, and she said that 3 out of 5 mask up regularly (including myself). To my knowledge, this means that 2 out of 5 don't. She has night staff that she will occasionally ask for help (there are four night PSW's on rotation), but as far as I know they are not consistently around her. I am not comfortable knowing that she has a rotation of people coming in and out of her home that do not take appropriate COVID precautions. Is it out of line for me to ask her to wear a mask? Can she refuse? What am I allowed and not allowed to do in this situation? 

When I've encouraged her to wear a mask, she'll wear it. However, she can be very sloppy with keeping it on. During meal times, I don't expect her to keep it on, but she has no problem staying close to me and having conversation with me at a distance less than 2m away. She can take a long time to finish her meal and throughout this time she is un-masked.

 Went to get tested today. Canada is doing a amazing job with testing I went to north York general, it took a few hours but its not overcrowded, and the staff seem to have stock of ppe. They even have a dedicated section for Covid only to protect other patients.

While there is a ration in tests having only 300 infected after so long is amazing. If you dont pass to get covid testing they may get you other tests such as Xrays etc.

Overall my experience was amazing and ontario is doing great job. Even the super markets are stocked.

My only complaint. The hospital is so cold.

 Why Canada Will Fail to "Flatten the Curve": Asymptomatic Transmission and Not Using Masks TLDR; Asymptomatic transmission is common so we all need to start wearing masks.


I'm very glad Canada has been responding to the crisis much better than many countries, however it is not enough to "Flatten the Curve" to a point that will be manageable for our healthcare system. There are two widespread beliefs that I think are false that if corrected could result in action that could drastically help the situation:
1) Only people with symptoms spread the disease
2) Wearing masks is not recommended

These beliefs may turn out to be why we won't be able to "Flatten the Curve" to an extent that won't be catastrophic for the healthcare system.


1) There are reports that COVID-19 can be spread by someone without symptoms. Either an asymptomatic carrier or someone who will not show symptoms until a couple days later.





If this is true, we need to do a nation-wide lock down (preferably asap) or have mass testing. Unfortunately Canada does not have the capacity yet. 

Many government organizations are not fully recognizing asymptomatic transmission. Ex: Alberta Health says "only people with symptoms seem to be spreading the disease":


World Health Organization states "The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low."


Actions by government show that they don't believe in transmission before symptoms show:



2) Stigma against wearing a mask, shortage of masks, and statements that masks are not necessary unless sick

From Alberta Health:
• If you are healthy, medical masks are not recommended as they don't provide full protection and can create a false sense of security.
(source:  )

Mask shortages result in statements like this being issued:


Stigma: there is a stigma in Canada against using masks. It is not as common as in Asia, where many countries have been able to manage CORVID-19.
From u/NotSoSuperSleeper : 


Yet masks can be effective:

From u/BigNickDipples : 
Frrom u/ObjectivelyRed : 

Masks are needed ESPECIALLY to prevent the spread of the virus by people who are not showing symptoms.

We are headed to province-wide or nation-wide lock downs, which may not be effective enough if we don't use masks:


Yes, we have a mask shortage in Canada, and these need to go to health professionals first. However people should not be judged badly for wearing a mask (they could have an underlying health condition). We need to change our perception about masks. We also need to be doing more to make more masks not just for health professionals, but enough for the general population. Even coming up with creative solutions like DIY masks use for the general population to use can save lives

Thanks for reading, and stay safe and healthy!

 Question concerning being tested So starting yesterday, my girlfriend started getting sick with a cough, chest pain, body aches, etc. Today she woke up feeling worse so I advised her to call in sick to work and go to a clinic to get checked out. 

After coming home, she’s told me that the doctors diagnosis was the flu. However, my girlfriend told me that all they did was check her temp, blood pressure, physically checked her over and that was it. No swabs or blood work done or anything. 

So my question is, how is it they are able to diagnose it as the flu without doing further tests? And how can they be so certain it is the flu and not covid-19? 



As some additional background information: 
- neither of us has travelled outside of Canada recently  
- neither of us has attended a major event or outing

 My husband's boss is forcing the employees to work at Toronto Pearson Airport, is there any way to take legal action against this? Hi all,

I apologise if this is not the place to post this... So if I must be redirected, I will update this post to help you navigate back to this information.

Anyways, my husband works for maintenance at Toronto Pearson Airport, where just last Thursday, March 12th, he was working at the International Arrivals. Since this coronavirus stuff is just getting worse and worse by the hour... My husband doesn't feel it is safe to go back to work. I absolutely DO NOT want him going back, but he's feeling pressure to go back because he is afraid of losing his job.

So my question... Is there any way my husband can just decide "not to go into work" and have the law on his side?

I'm worried sick for him... There is still so much we do not know about this virus. We are both young (early-mid 20s), but even if we get it and we're "fine", who knows what the long term health consequences are? What if we spread it to more vulnerable members of our family? 

It's really pissing me off that his boss is "making" people go into work... And what's worse is that other people at his work want to go in to get money to pay their mortgages. So it's not like other staff are upset about the boss's decision.

Please help. Redirect me to a better page to post this if it's necessary... But don't just delete my post without warning me.

 Boyfriend has Corona and I don’t? So basically I want some one to clarify something for me. Me and my boyfriend live in canada and we see each other nearly everyday. On Monday we met up, and we made out. After we met by 2 hours he felt a bit sick and decided to do a covid test. 2 days later he is positive for Corona. Of course If he had it most likely i did so on Wednesday I had my test and on friday I was tested negative. How is this possible? We have been seeing each other for the past year, eating and drinking from the same utensils and basically exchanging saliva in every way. I had a fever and a sore throat Monday and Tuesday but i felt good after. 

My only conclusion is that he got it after he met me in those 2 hours OR I am somehow immune to corona.

Some of his family members and friends also have it.

He has a headache and some flu symptoms but no breathing problems what so ever. 

We are both 21 years old. 

I feel very good and healthy now and I have not seen him since Monday. 

Please give me your thoughts on this.
