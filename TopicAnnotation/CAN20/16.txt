 How Taiwan is beating COVID-19 without closing schools or workplaces. Western countries could learn a lot from this. Common practices include wearing masks in public, taking your temperature before entering public places and schools, frequent hand washing, plexiglass dividers between desks, etc. Maybe a glimpse of western life after covid19?

 Yet another travel question but this really confuses me: Are boyfriend girlfriend relationships regarded as immidiate family and can I visit my girlfriend in Canada from Europe if we prove we're in a relationship and will live together while I'm in Canada? Canada allows family members to reunite again and I'm wondering the above question. Thank you for your responses.

 Gearing up to restart: Businesses’ need for personal protective equipment / Préparatifs pour la reprise : les besoins des entreprises en matière d’équipement de protection individuelle *\[We are Canada’s national statistical agency. We are here to engage with Canadians and provide them with high-quality statistical information that matters!\]*

Using data collected from the Personal Protective Equipment Survey in July 2020, our new [study]( and [infographic](//www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/11-627-m/11-627-m2020061-eng.htm?utm_source=reddit2&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=statcan_ppd_2020) examine businesses’ demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) and concerns about lack of supply. 

Here are some highlights:

· As of July, a little over two-thirds (69.1%) of businesses operating in the provinces need, or expect to need, PPE to operate in accordance with COVID-19-related public health guidance.

· At least four out of five businesses in accommodation and food services, health care and social assistance, retail trade, and construction require PPE. 

· Of the businesses that need PPE, two-thirds (67.3%) need at least 4 of the 12 types of PPE covered by the Personal Protective Equipment Survey.

À l’aide de données recueillies dans le cadre de l’Enquête sur l’équipement de protection individuelle de juillet 2020, notre nouvel [article]( et notre nouvelle [infographie]( examinent la demande d’équipement de protection individuelle (EPI) des entreprises et leurs préoccupations quant à leur disponibilité.

Voici quelques faits saillants :

· En juillet, un peu plus des deux tiers (69,1 %) des entreprises en exploitation dans les provinces canadiennes avaient besoin ou prévoyaient avoir besoin d’EPI pour exercer leurs activités en respectant les directives des autorités sanitaires liées à la COVID-19.

· Au moins 4 entreprises sur 5 dans les secteurs des services d’hébergement et de restauration, des soins de santé et de l’assistance sociale, du commerce de détail et de la construction ont indiqué avoir besoin d’EPI.

· Parmi les entreprises ayant besoin d’EPI, les deux tiers (67,3 %) ont déclaré avoir besoin d’au moins 4 des 12 types d’EPI mentionnés dans l’enquête.

 PSA: Criminally Irresponsible Company Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

I  am writing this with the intention of getting advice for my next steps,  and letting the public know about what is happening at my workplace,  and how it will affect them.

&amp;#x200B;

I  work at a large commercial moving company based in Toronto.  They have no intention of  shutting down.  Technically, it has been deemed an essential business  (transportation), but 90% of businesses also seem to be essential in  Ontario.  I don't think society will crumble if some big company can't  move their headquarters from one high rise to another.  Do you?

&amp;#x200B;

They  have put in place no policies to protect the movers.  There is no PTO.   People are scared of calling in sick lest they receive a cut in hours.   Full-time workers have no benefits.  We don't receive hazard pay.  We  don't even get overtime.  There has been no change in policy to protect  workers.  Nothing.  Well, they did give us nitrile gloves and a big  bottle of hand sanitizer at the dispatch.

&amp;#x200B;

Now how does this affect you?

&amp;#x200B;

On  a busy day we have around 50 people working.  Those 50 people will  interact face to face among each other throughout the week.  Including  those 50 initial movers, our company also has around 30-40 office  workers, 10 warehouse workers, and a plethora of third party truck  drivers coming in and out and in and out.  Some of these third party  truck drivers are also making deliveries to New York state (20,000 cases  at time of writing).

&amp;#x200B;

Back  to those 50 initial movers now.  We touch random surfaces all day, we  interact with clients, we make deliveries all over southern Ontario.   Imagine if one person at this company was sick.  Imagine how many people  would become infected in a matter of two weeks.  These movers are  people who go to your grocery stores, live in your communities, they  might even be in your social bubble.  If not the movers then someone  they've interacted with.

&amp;#x200B;

Regardless  of all of this, the owner and upper management has been fighting tooth  and nail to stay open, and to take on as many jobs as possible.  And for  what?  Money.  We are humans, not a pieces of meat.

&amp;#x200B;

This  company is literally risking public health and safety.  The owner  doesn't care about us.  The management doesn't care about us.  People  will get sick, and God forbid die from the actions (or inaction) of the  upper echelon of this company.

&amp;#x200B;

I am very reluctant to share anymore information, but if I can initiate a meaningful course of action I will gladly share more.  

&amp;#x200B;

What can I do for now?  Any advice?

 Can you report a business that's violating the provincial order? Non-essential businesses are still staying open.

Is there any way to report those that do?

 Canada unlikely to return to normal until there is a COVID-19 vaccine

 Ontario needs a vaccine. The world needs a vaccine. There is no reason that a vaccine to #COVID19 can’t come from right here in Ontario. We have some of the best and brightest, and we’re increasing their funding by $20 million to support them in finding a solution.

 Defining "essential" services Things like health care, first responders, groceries, pharmacies, and transportation of essential goods are the obvious exemptions, but we've all seen (and mercilessly mocked) Ontario's laundry list of exemptions for what can at best he considered secondary services. 

I think the issue is that once you really get into it, it's difficult to define essential vs non-essential in blanket terms. 

Many of the businesses classed as "essential" truly are not - at least not in the sense that they *all* need to be open or that they need to be open to everyone or at their full capacity. 

For example, no, Tim Hortons is not an essential service. That's absurd. However, truckers *are* essential and they need to have places to stop for meals and bathroom breaks every 3-5 hours, so we do need *some* restaurants and/or cafes open to service them. 

The problem is that we can't just arbitrarily pick one restaurant or cafe per town that gets to stay open while the rest are forced to shut down. 

Or can we? 

Maybe that is what we need to explore - how can we do that fairly? 

Or are there other alternatives we should be considering for how we feed and meet the bathroom and sanitation needs of essential services? 

I don't have a solution to present here, which is why I flaired this post as general discussion. 

One idea I'd like to toss out though is a lottery system for deciding which secondary services remain open to ensure that the needs of essential workers are met. Governments would have to determine how many of a business type need to be open per so many km and then businesses could choose whether or not to apply for the lottery. 

The only other option I can think of is to restrict the movement of people rather than the operation of businesses, but my initial assumption (please do correct me if I've got it wrong) is that enforcement would be both logistically challenging and much more expensive than the administrative costs associated with the lottery system. 

Anyways. These are my thoughts and I'd really love to hear some other ideas and people's responses to mine and other commenters ideas. 

Discuss.
