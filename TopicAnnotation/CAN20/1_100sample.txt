 It has been PROVEN that masks are INEFFECTIVE against COVID-19. This can be demonstrated by vaping while wearing a surgical, cotton/cloth, sponge or N-95 mask. 



The aerosols produced by an e-cigarette (or “vape”) have a size of approximately 120-165 nanometers. The aerosols in the exhaled vape easily exit the mask VISIBLY between the point of contact of the face and the mask. In some masks, the aerosols even go THROUGH the front of the mask.  Consequently, the viral particles also pass around/through the mask; a COVID-19 viral particle is approximately 60-140 nanometers in diameter, which is even smaller than aerosol particles, on average. It is therefore pointless to wear a mask unless you plan on sneezing/coughing in someone’s face because it only blocks large droplets effectively (but your elbow can do this for you) If you walk down the same aisle as someone else in a grocery store or go anywhere remotely near the place they walked (while both wearing masks and keeping a 2-meter distance), you are still very likely to inhale viral particles as they remain in the air for ~ 3 HOURS. 

Let me know why you think I’m wrong, if you disagree.

 PSA: Even a poorly designed homemade mask is more effective than wearing no mask 

I understand why people shouldn’t be hoarding masks, but there is overwhelming scientific evidence that a mask is better than nothing. If you have masks to spear or can make your own, do so before you go outside.

 Self-innoculation with surgical and non-medical masks? It seems like something that our top doctors keep saying, and on a smaller scale, my company (retail store focusing on pharmacy, stores in most of Western Canada) keeps saying retail workers don't need surgical masks, if someone wants to wear a homemade mask go ahead but remember the risk of self-innoculation - aka rubbing virus with your own hands into the outside of the "mask" and then inhaling it.

The way they've been talking about it it seems like the risk of self-innoculation if even higher than not wearing a mask at all. Now that's been seen as an excuse to not recommend buying of medical masks, and something our leaders have mislead us with. 

What's the actual science behind this? Is risk actually higher than not wearing a face covering?

 Could a K.Kwong design dyi face mask with a surgical mask filter be a temp solution for healthcare workers? Kenneth Kwong is a HK chemist who has designed a cloth face mask that when used with regular paper towels has up to a N85 rating. 

I am posing a question whether his face mask if used with a surgical mask and face guard could be a temporary solution for healthcare workers when there is a shortage of N95 mask

Not saying this is ideal but better than just having a surgical mask.  Just to re-iterate this post is a question not a statement

 Masks: If worn properly, they work! *tl;dr at the bottom*

Because of a worldwide shortage of surgical and NIOSH approved masks, many levels of public health official and government told people that masks are not necessary for 'people in public who feel fine'.

They didn't want panic hoarding (too late) and people freaking out (again, too late), so they went with 'keep your distance' instead. And this cannot be stressed enough: KEEP YOUR DISTANCE! Let this be your new mantra: "Six feet for me, Six feet for you!"

That said, masks do work. There are a lot of misinformed people claiming masks don't do anything to prevent getting sick. This is 100% wrong, however, it's complicated, because there are different kinds of masks and they don't all offer the same protection.

First off, you need to know that COVID-19 is spread through particulate transmission. The particulate matter discharged when we sneeze or cough (our saliva, mucus, sputum, etc.) is aerosolised and C-19 sticks to this particulate matter.

Surgical Masks: These are the thin masks medical personnel (and many in Asian countries) wear. These DO NOT prevent inhaled transmission. They do, however, significantly cut down on exhaled transmission, because they have an inside liner designed to trap / stop particulate matter. If you see a person wearing a surgical mask, they are not protecting themselves, but THEY ARE potentially protecting YOU.

NIOSH masks. These are called respirator masks and they will be clearly marked with N95, P95, R95, etc. to indicate their specific purpose. These masks (when fitted properly) will prevent both in and out transmission. If you see someone wearing one of these masks, they are protecting both you and themselves (again, if fitted correctly) and helping cut down on transmission.

Dust masks: They look a bit like NIOSH masks, but are not as thick. They're meant only to block large particulate matter (sawdust, etc.). These offer no protection value, as the their pores are too large to trap particulate matter and virus. DO NOT WEAR THESE. You will likely be touching your face, etc., to adjust these, because they are loose-fitting, and you are increasing your risk of contraction. 

NOW... IF YOU ARE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE who believes masks don't work, or only "sick people" are wearing masks in public, you are wrong. Please, for the love of your own family and mine, accept you were wrong, shake it off, and get on the same page. Carriers of COVID-19 can be asymptomatic (no actual signs / symptoms) and STILL BE transmitting full viral load.

Here is the facts: This virus is spread by particulate transmission. If every single Canadian was wearing a surgical mask (which traps outgoing transmission) at all times - transmission wouldn't be possible, because each particulate carrying a viral load would not be able to spread.

If you see someone in a mask, they're helping. Give them their 6 feet and carry on.

**tl;dr – Masks work when worn properly. Wear them.**

 2nd hand smoke and mask mandate I just read that 1.2 million people die of 2nd hand smoke every year.     I understand the governments good intent with the mask mandate.   But does anybody think we might be going a bit overboard?    How many homeless people are going to wear masks?   Are we going to throw them in jail?       They won't even stay in shelters...what makes us think we can convince them to wear a mask?      And for that matter...smoking kills 4 times more people than covid.   Yet nobody is going to throw a smoker in jail.    For that matter, alcohol as well.    The government actually makes profit from selling alcohol and cigarettes.    Also, there are people that just don't have the same beliefs about the virus, that the main stream people do.    Can we really dictate what they are and aren't supposed to believe?   I don't agree with the conspiracy theories.

 Why is there so much mask stigma in Canada? Even in healthcare we are still discouraging patients wearing masks when they come in. Why? I am a nurse at a clinic that needs to remain open. We are not treating COVID19 patients but we might eventually encounter them. We are also screening anyone that comes in and if they have symptoms they are identified and given a mask. But many patients are coming in with no symptoms and are wearing a mask from home to protect themselves. Higher ups and coworkers are continuing to scoff at patients wearing masks when they come in (just the assymptomatic ones) These patients have no symptoms but just want to protect themselves. The original argument was they do not wear them properly and take them on and off without washing hands and touch things etc. The other argument was it can’t be good for them breathing in their own breath? It might make them sick? Is there any evidence for this? I feel like I’m the only one at work that thinks wearing a mask is a good idea. We should be educating patients on how to properly wear a mask in my opinion. And we should all be wearing them. Staff and patients. But I feel like I can’t even bring up the argument because everyone else seems to think the opposite. What should I do? Are they right?

 So, what's your guess....? How long will we be wearing masks for? I'm thinking we could wear them to shop, to go to work, church, and other public places into 2022. I kind of doubt the pandemic is over in 2021.  We will get multiple vaccines in 2020, some will work well, some might not.  And numbers should go down with all the measures taken.  But the vaccines might not be around until the Spring or even into the Summer.  And it will take months to get them into people.  So \*possibly\* this is over before Christmas of 2021, but I wouldn't bet too much on that.  And we will want to be through and have a 'better safe than sorry' approach.  So masks might still be worn for some time.

 [QUESTION] I am a Personal Support Worker for a disabled client. Is my client required to wear a mask for the duration of my shift? I wear all required PPE and take appropriate COVID precautions. She does not wear a mask during my shifts (8 hours). She also does not wear a mask when her other support workers come in. I've asked her, and she said that 3 out of 5 mask up regularly (including myself). To my knowledge, this means that 2 out of 5 don't. She has night staff that she will occasionally ask for help (there are four night PSW's on rotation), but as far as I know they are not consistently around her. I am not comfortable knowing that she has a rotation of people coming in and out of her home that do not take appropriate COVID precautions. Is it out of line for me to ask her to wear a mask? Can she refuse? What am I allowed and not allowed to do in this situation? 

When I've encouraged her to wear a mask, she'll wear it. However, she can be very sloppy with keeping it on. During meal times, I don't expect her to keep it on, but she has no problem staying close to me and having conversation with me at a distance less than 2m away. She can take a long time to finish her meal and throughout this time she is un-masked.

 Regarding mask misinformation Hi there,

If you look outside your window, there may be anti-maskers protesting the use of masks.  

We want to make it clear that this subreddit is about factual information.  It is not a platform for anyone to disregard the importance of masks.  Like all forms of PPE,  nothing is truly 100% effective, but it does mitigate the risks of acquiring the coronavirus for you, and most importantly, the people around you.  

As of today, any rhetoric that suggests, implies, or explicitly states that masks are not effective or utilizes bad faith arguments (ie., “they are not 100% effective so why bother?), or I can’t breathe, etc. will result in a **permanent ban.**  

There is no more excuse for this kind of rhetoric.

 Is Metro Sports Golf Complex at Milner in Scarborough Unsafe? Hello Everyone,

Is Metro Sports Golf Complex unsafe? Me and some friends are planning to meet tommorrow to hang out and we were deciding on a golf range to go to and there is this one buts its indoors but the area of the place is huge.

I checked it out and the area is implementing social distancing polices with masks and sanitizers and people are wearing masks. Still I havent left my house except for walks for 3 months, literally ive been stuck in my neighbourhood. 

Since it isnt outdoors, I might wear my balacava with a PM 2.5 filter, N95 Mask over it with googles and a face shield or is that too much? Should I wear a N95 Mask and a Face Shield or is a regular mask fine despite it being indoors?

We also don't know all that much about the virus so maybe it does help a little bit. Do you think maybe we were told the mask is useless to stop people from panicking during this mask shortage?

And why do people hate and judge others who decide to wear a mask? So what if the mask is completely useless, if it gives people wearing it a sense of security, what's the matter? Why do people judge and stare? Like, let people do whatever the fuxk they want.

 The kind of disturbing narrative coming out of the Conservative Party of Canada in the middle of Saskatchewan during a 10x larger Covid outbreak than we've ever seen. This is verbatim from a political email today, from the CPC Candidate:

Tl:dr Wannabe Politician who is Not-A-Scientist says don't wear masks.

Quote: 
In municipalities across Canada, the wearing of masks is being mandated.
And, more and more, people are calling on their provincial governments to make the wearing of masks mandatory, province-wide.
This is very disturbing.
It’s strange that this is happening now, when the numbers of infections are so much lower than they were in March and April. Remember, at that time, our medical experts—such as the World Health Organization and their followers—were telling us that masks wouldn’t do anything to stop the spread of the virus, and in fact might make it worse. Remember that?
Back then, I’d already noticed that Canada’s Chief Medical Health Officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, was only parroting the directives of the World Health Organization, and those directives did not seem to have the best interests of Canadians in mind.
Back then, with the WHO against masks, it seemed to some of us that voluntary mask-wearing wasn’t such a bad idea. After all, if the WHO was against mask-wearing, maybe that was a reason to consider wearing a mask!
I wasn’t alone in looking at the success places like Hong Kong and Taiwan were experiencing in dealing with the virus and in suggesting that we emulate them. They had ignored the WHO, wisely sealed their borders with Communist China early on, and encouraged the wearing of masks among their citizens.
But that was then. Something changed. And the WHO has since gone from “masks don’t work” to “masks must be worn”.
And now the power-hungry, power-seeking governments at every level have been following this new WHO directive with great enthusiasm. Is this a surprise?
With cases of and hospitalizations due to COVID-19 trending way down, this sudden passion for mandatory masking that has been embraced by politicians and the media alike seems to have more to do with political control than with safety.
In my opinion, Canadians who feel more comfortable while wearing a mask should feel free to do so if they wish, but I am 100% against ever making masks mandatory.
￼
Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty. We must carefully guard our freedoms at all times, especially in times of crisis, when authoritarian politicians more interested in ruling than in governing us may be tempted to “temporarily” relieve us of freedoms which we will never recover.
I am also 100% opposed to making any eventual COVID-19 vaccine mandatory for Canadians, and, if elected, will amend the Canada Health Act to further regulate provincial governments’ health care systems in order guarantee “vaccine CHOICE” for all Canadians. And when it comes to vaccines for children, that decision should be left up the parents, not the government.
I will never back down from defending the natural rights that form the bedrock of Canadian life—personal liberty and parental rights—and I will guard against any attempts to limit them, even in the name of “public safety”.
The primacy of personal freedom from state overreach is a truly conservative value that it is my duty to defend absolutely.
Mandatory masks? Not a chance. Where do the other candidates stand on masks?

 Why Canada Will Fail to "Flatten the Curve": Asymptomatic Transmission and Not Using Masks TLDR; Asymptomatic transmission is common so we all need to start wearing masks.


I'm very glad Canada has been responding to the crisis much better than many countries, however it is not enough to "Flatten the Curve" to a point that will be manageable for our healthcare system. There are two widespread beliefs that I think are false that if corrected could result in action that could drastically help the situation:
1) Only people with symptoms spread the disease
2) Wearing masks is not recommended

These beliefs may turn out to be why we won't be able to "Flatten the Curve" to an extent that won't be catastrophic for the healthcare system.


1) There are reports that COVID-19 can be spread by someone without symptoms. Either an asymptomatic carrier or someone who will not show symptoms until a couple days later.





If this is true, we need to do a nation-wide lock down (preferably asap) or have mass testing. Unfortunately Canada does not have the capacity yet. 

Many government organizations are not fully recognizing asymptomatic transmission. Ex: Alberta Health says "only people with symptoms seem to be spreading the disease":


World Health Organization states "The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low."


Actions by government show that they don't believe in transmission before symptoms show:



2) Stigma against wearing a mask, shortage of masks, and statements that masks are not necessary unless sick

From Alberta Health:
• If you are healthy, medical masks are not recommended as they don't provide full protection and can create a false sense of security.
(source:  )

Mask shortages result in statements like this being issued:


Stigma: there is a stigma in Canada against using masks. It is not as common as in Asia, where many countries have been able to manage CORVID-19.
From u/NotSoSuperSleeper : 


Yet masks can be effective:

From u/BigNickDipples : 
Frrom u/ObjectivelyRed : 

Masks are needed ESPECIALLY to prevent the spread of the virus by people who are not showing symptoms.

We are headed to province-wide or nation-wide lock downs, which may not be effective enough if we don't use masks:


Yes, we have a mask shortage in Canada, and these need to go to health professionals first. However people should not be judged badly for wearing a mask (they could have an underlying health condition). We need to change our perception about masks. We also need to be doing more to make more masks not just for health professionals, but enough for the general population. Even coming up with creative solutions like DIY masks use for the general population to use can save lives

Thanks for reading, and stay safe and healthy!

 False Rumors Part 1: "Masks Don't Work" There have been lots of misinformation as to whether or not you should wear a mask.

So, to protect ourselves and others, should we wear a mask?

My answer is, yes, you should most definitely wear a mask.

Dr. Perencevich said, “There’s no evidence that wearing masks on healthy people will protect them.”

If your only reason for the fact that the masks don’t do anything is that there is no evidence that they will protect you from the virus, what kind of argument is that? 

Also, this statement is actually incorrect. Of course, masks won't guarantee that you won't get the virus, but there is lots of evidence that they help to some extent. Like the flu, Coronavirus sometimes spreads through the air. Masks help reduce that. Coronavirus mostly spreads through droplets, though, from when people speak, for instance. This is one reason that people have said about masks not working, but that’s the *entire point* of wearing a mask! Masks can block some of that out!

Dr. Perencevich also claimed that wearing a face mask could increase the chance of infection because you're touching your face more often. Educate yourself! Don’t avoid something that does more good than bad just because you don’t know how to use it, especially when you can easily find a tutorial online that shows you and gives you advice.

Even if you still don’t agree with a single thing I say, you should still let other people do what they want. If someone else wants to wear a mask, leave them alone. In fact, they might even be wearing it to protect you!

The doctor also stated, “The one time you would want a mask is if you’re sick and you have to leave the house. If you have the flu or think you have COVID, that’s when you’d put on a mask to protect others. In your house, if you feel like you’re sick, you should wear a mask to protect your family members.”

I completely agree! Do wear a mask if you are or feel sick. *Please* do. My only problem with this is that the symptoms of COVID 19 only start appearing around 14 days after, and spreading of the virus before symptoms show *happens.* It's not necessarily that common, but there have been a couple of cases caused by asymptomatic community spread. This means that you wouldn’t know if you’re sick.

Besides, other people who already know that they're sick wouldn't want to wear a mask if everyone is going to stare at them and say, "You know, masks don't do anything, right?"

 Facts about N95 masks. I am going to repost a comment I made earlier in a thread which was talking about N95 masks. I heard a few people in conversation spreading misinformation and also have seen quite a few people improperly wearing or reusing N95s in public so I feel this needed more visibility. 

&gt; Yes N95s are sized and then seal checked. The process is basically they size you up for a mask and you put it on. Then they cover your entire head with a hood and spray some bitter and sweet sprays inside. If you taste either then your N95 failed the seal check and you try another size and repeat the test. All hospital staff know their size of N95. 

&gt; In regard to properly donning and doffing the mask, you are correct a used mask is dangerous. As it filters the air you breath the mask concentrates any contaminants from the environment onto the mask surface. To properly donn the mask you place it on your face and then put the elastics behind your head one at a time ensuring they are smooth and not crossed or caught in your hair. You then firmly press down the metal nose tab with your fingers so that it is snug. You then perform a seal check by exhaling repeatedly while holding your hands 4” or so from the edges of the mask, move your hands around the sides of your face like a “mime making a box around his head”, if you feel a breeze on your hands you failed the test and need to readjust. Once a snug fit is ensured you are ready to go to work. 

&gt; When doffing you never ever touch the “filter” part of the mask. You only touch the elastics!!! You never put the mask down around your neck or over your head. When taking it off it comes straight off in this very specific method: you take a forward leaning stance so your shoulders and neck are in front of your feet, you take the bottom elastic from behind your head and flip it up and over so it hangs loosely in front, you then take the top elastic and stretch it out sideways and up over your head while maintaining pressure to hold the mask still, at the critical moment when the elastic is in line with the mask you move the whole thing forward and away from your face in a smooth motion. Again you never touch the mask itself, you only touch the elastic when taking it off. It’s easier to show you the process than describe it. But I cannot stress this enough the masks are considered biohazards once used and go in the red/yellow bags for the incinerator. 

&gt; Additionally N95s are not actually a true filter, the virus is smaller than the opening in the mask and can pass through, however they work on the principle that they are a fine weave of random fibres and the virus gets caught and sticks to the weave. After extended use their effectiveness decreases. 

&gt; Another thing to note. Properly fitted N95s are difficult to breath in. You will get hot and sweaty and they restrict the airflow when you breath in (like breathing through a heavy sweater). Staff will change through multiple N95s throughout a shift and they are not worn for extended periods on end. Often not longer than 45-60 minutes maximum. If an N95 is comfortable and/or loose then it is not working properly. If there is not an airtight seal between the mask and your face then you are breathing “around” the mask. Air will always take the path of least resistance and the masks are serious resistance. 

&gt; Source. I work in a Ontario hospital. I am fit tested and trained on how to wear an N95.

 Public service workers, if not everyone in the public, should be wearing simple homemade facemasks. This will probably get taken down but at least I tried. 

I know medical experts in Canada and the US have said that healthy people should not be wearing masks and that we should reserve masks for medical people. I agree with that - ALL ACTUAL MEDICAL MASKS SHOULD BE RESERVED FOR HOSPITALS AND MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS. 

However, I believe that public service workers should start adopting wearing basic homemade cloth facemasks or non-medical grade facemasks in public. Basic cloth facemasks are still considered as a last resort for medical professionals if they are stuck with nothing else to use. 

According to the CDC: [In settings where facemasks are not available, HCP might use homemade masks \(e.g., bandana, scarf\) for care of patients with COVID-19 as a last resort.]( ... and yes they do qualify that by saying that a face-shield should be used as well, but it does show that even any kind of mask is useful instead of none. 

Here are a few criticisms by prominent medical professionals on why we should start wearing masks in the US and in Canada: 

  



I think the biggest thing that wearing a face mask does is it is a psychological tool. 

- It reminds the wearer not to touch their face or touch it less often. 
- It distances us from each other because when you see someone with a mask you feel cautious. 
- It reminds everyone that there is an infectious disease spreading everywhere 
- It reminds us that there is a worldwide pandemic happening 

Wearing a mask is also important from the point of view that no one knows who is infected until it is too late. There are also asymptomatic carriers who will never know they had the virus but end up passing on to others. Does it make any sense to allow public service workers to be constantly and daily exposed if we don't know how many people they may come into contact with that may or may not have the virus? 

People are resistant to wearing a mask in Canada and the US because we are not used to it. We associate it to the end of the world and that something terrible has happened. If we all start wearing them now, it will feel panicky for a short while but after a week or so, we will normalize it and it will just be another part of living in a pandemic. In the long run, it will add to the efforts we are doing to 'flatten the curve' or 'plank the curve'. 

Businesses are resistant to seeing people, especially their employees, wearing masks - not from a medical or preventative point of view but from an image point of view. No big company wants their employees in their fancy modern restaurants, coffee shops, grocery stores or store fronts wearing masks. Many employees are reporting that they are discouraged from wearing masks because it will 'scare the customers away'. What business doesn't understand is that at one point, when more and more people are wearing masks, those people will start to avoid places where workers are not wearing masks because they will start to be seen as places where infection control is not taken seriously. 

It is also so very wrong to tell public workers to not wear masks because you want to maintain your company image at the expense of putting your workers at risk. This is going to be weeks if not months or over a year of infection control, quarantining and isolation so we have to do everything we can to protect ourselves, especially our public front line workers who are exposed every single day. 

**To all you workers out there,** you will have to take action yourselves because your government and business owners won't do it for you until they absolutely have to. Wear a mask, protect yourselves and take the initiative because everyone else will wait until enough of you get sick or die before doing anything about it.

 Fabric Masks Hi Everyone,

A friend of mine has started the Canada Sews facebook group to create fabric masks for front line workers/ workers that are deemed essential services, like grocery stores, nursing homes, truck drivers etc. Since a majority of work places has had an impact on work hours she started to make fabric masks for her family and it blew up from there to a Canada wide volunteer system. I will be posting a link to a Globe and Mail article below as well as the website to Canada Sews to make requests for masks/ volunteer sign-up!

If you are or anyone you know is interested in donating material or assisting in creating fabric masks I am posting a link to their website for more information.

If you belong to an organization that requires masks as well you can make a request for masks.

 Petition to Make Masks Mandatory in Saskatchewan I hope it's ok to post this here.  To me, wearing masks seems like such an obvious, simple way to lower the risk of transmission of Covid-19.  [It's what Health Canada recommends.](  I've been thrilled to hear about other countries, states, provinces and cities mandating masks in public indoor spaces.  But here in SK, that isn't happening.

We've had a brutal couple of days in terms of our numbers.  [Our number of known active cases have increased by 400% in less than 2 weeks.](  I'm not trying to sound alarmist, but it sounds like community spread is on the rise in Saskatchewan and things are going to get worse before they get better.  And yet masks have not been mandated.

Some people are diligently wearing their masks, but most people aren't.  People are blatantly ignoring the arrows in stores and are failing to physically distance - I've experienced it firsthand.  Some people are ignorant, some are oblivious and some are unwilling to subject themselves to a little inconvenience and discomfort to save lives.  Some just plain don't care.  Hell, my neighbor spews bullshit conspiracy theories about Bill Gates every chance he gets and has actively tried to talk my spouse and me out of wearing masks.  Because it's "not as bad" here as in other places or no one they personally know has caught it, a lot of people seem to think Covid-19 isn't a threat.

**Bottom line: most people here aren't going to wear masks unless they're forced to.**

The Saskatchewan Nurse's Union [has been begging for a mask mandate](  The Saskatchwan Medical Association [is calling on people to wear masks]( Countless people who work with the public wish masks were mandatory.

I decided to start a petition.  My hope is I can take it to decision makers in this province and use it to apply a little more pressure to them to mandate masks.  Maybe it will help or maybe it won't, but I have to try.  I'm hoping to reach 1,000 signatures, but I'll be contacting those in charge on Monday regardless as I don't want to wait too long.

**If you live in SK and care about reducing our number of active cases...**

**If you don't want people from SK spreading Covid-19 to your area when they travel...**

**If you care about sparing other human beings from preventable illness and death...**

**Please sign and consider sharing on social media.**

Thank you and stay safe!

 Mask Discrimination. I recently decided that I would start wearing a bandana as a mask and wearing gloves when going into stores and I'd like to share some real stories about mask discrimination and invite others to do the same.  

My first story involves going into a dispensary to stock up on mental health essentials.  This particular store has social distancing measures in place and plexi screens everywhere.  At first glance they appear to be taking the pandemic seriously, however upon entering the other day with my mask and gloves on one particularly large (fat) customer noticed me and struck up a conversation with the clerk in a loud voice saying that masks are BS and anyone wearing one is obviously sick and should be fined for going outside.  The clerk responded with a quip about being unconcerned by SARS2 since he was young and healthy.  The customer did not choose to meet my gaze as he left; breaking social distancing rules as he passed.  The clerk did not choose to speak to me further than necessary to complete the transaction; when I asked how his day was he remained silent and was very sure to remain behind his screen while handing me my purchase.  

My second story involves going to a nearby grocery store recently.  Not much to tell here, if you've ever seen that Disney movie about Moses and recall the scene where he parts the waters you will know exactly what happened when my partner and I walked down the aisles.  Dirty looks, hushed tones and a very wide berth.  Not complaining so much about that, I like that masks act as people repellent but I could do without the sneers and quiet insults.

Masks save lives people.  If you don't want to wear one, that's fine but let's have some respect for the people who choose to wear them.

Cheers.

 Why isn't there training on how to wear a mask? I see so many people pulling their mask forward when they speak or when they need to shout to get someone’s attention. Not to mention there are so many instances of masked being worn with the nose exposed. It makes me wonder why the federal government is not investing in ads for proper use of mask.

 Covid vs Coffee in the office Hello  I am back to work for the first time this year, it's a call center and we have to wear masks all day for 3 months of training.   

Are people in offices these days allowed to remove their masks every other moment to sip their coffee?  

Removing the mask constantly like that, I could see as an issue.
Not having my coffee would also be an issue.

I need coffee at work.   NEED.

How does this work with wearing a mask?
Thank you.

 Quebec covid-19 circus  People have made thousands of masks at the request from the government of quebec(my mother and sister alone made 200 masks in 3 days).In fabric,only one layer ,and single use. These masks do not protect from the coronavirus. Why not wear it all week long? Because so, by telling people  to throw it away after 24h we assume that this mask is effective a minimum, all that so that you return to work because  if not our leaders would have to face the music in front of an entire planet which points to us without even being aware of it. The situation is out of control point.Why lie to us? Because your beloved province and country does not have masks for you. My mother and sister felt they were helping. they worked their ass off. I found it sad for them, and for those who wear them. I am sad for all Quebecers in general, I feel sorry for those who advocate harruda and company because they have this false sense of security towards our government, this same false sense of security that those who work with these masks. the false feelings of security that harruda warned us about so much. what happens at home is shameful. i don't call it lack of transparency, it is rather negligence and misinformation manipulation and lies. the answers we are given are confused because it would be rather hard for these people to admit that they have crashed and that they are sailing a sinking boat, that He doesn’t there is no life jacket in this ship, so as not to have to admit to everyone that they screwed up, they would prefer to prepare a big party to divert the attention of the passengers from the danger that awaits them. Do you really think that those who are capable of this feel an ounce of empathy towards the people? It’s the rhyme ‘it was a small ship’ that Mr. Harruda should hum to us, hopping miracle fishs come to us at the end because he already made the sauce for us.

 Awkward experience wearing mask at the clinic...mask stigma really is a thing here. Context: I'm pregnant, and have been working from home for nearly a month with my husband. We haven't travelled for a year, and have essentially self-quarantined out of precaution for the last two weeks. We've been perfectly healthy, free of cold/flu/etc, and we want to keep it that way.

I went to the clinic for a routine prenatal checkup. My husband and I were wearing surgical masks out of precaution because we would be around quite a few people within close proximity.

As we were waiting for my turn in the sitting area, I noticed that we were the only people wearing masks, and no one else did.

In about 5 minutes, a staff came to us, and started asking questions.

"Do you experience flu-like symptoms? Have you recently travelled? Have you..." etc, etc.

We answered no, and said that we were only wearing masks out of self-protection.

She said something along the lines of "are you sure?", with a suspicious look on her face.

Puzzled at her doubts, we assured our answer.

She then asked who we were seeing, and I said the nurse.

Then she said, slowly, with a face of half-belief "well, thank you for being honest", as if we were trying to hide something.

Out of all the people sitting there, we, even though we've clearly taken great responsibility for the extra gears, got grilled.

I get it, wearing masks make us really stick out in a crowd. But that at least should show that we have a sense of responsibility, either for ourselves since we are healthy, or for others, suppose if we were really coming down with something.

There were a couple of people seldomly coughing in the waiting space. It would make a lot more sense to go to them and ask if they'd like to wear a mask instead.

I felt flustered by the experience, and a bit embarrassed. I'd rather see more people exercising extra caution than not, even when they are not sick. But if that's the attitude people have when seeing others wearing masks, I don't know what kind of message it delivers. 🤷‍♀️

 Surgical Masks for general citizens I don't have a sewing kit, elastics, or sewing kit.

I'll wear something on my next trip out for my biweekly groceries but I have to ask.



Where can we buy masks and not take from healthcare workers?


I see the tides changing and now all of a sudden the government is pretending like they've told us masks have always been important and we're stupid for not wearing them.


Does anyone have any links for surgical masks or even homemade? I don't want to be barred by a grocery store when this policy knee jerk switches.

It’s been established now that wearing a mask can help protect those around you from you, but is there any evidence to suggest that wearing a mask can help protect you from particles from the outside?

 Are the masks being sold in stores "surgical masks"? I am a teacher heading back to school this week and I would like to wear a mask that protects me as much as possible. N95s are out because the students won't be able to hear me clearly when I talk. But I found some information that said that surgical masks are more effective against COVID than cloth masks. Only problem is, I don't know if the masks that \*look\* like surgical masks being sold in places like Costco and Walmart are actually the right kind. Does anybody know the answer? My family doctor didn't know. lol

 Shopping at T&amp;T with mandatory masking policy Last night I shopped at the T&amp;T grocery store in Waterloo. If you aren't familiar with T&amp;T they are a Chinese grocery chain with stores across Canada and they have a mandatory masking policy. 

To enter the store, you had to have on a mask, submit to a temperature check and sanitize your hands. It was not optional. Outside the store in the lineup to get in, two people did not have masks and they were informed they had to have on a mask. The male started to complain but the female with him told to be quiet and went to their car and got masks for them both. Surgical masks were available for sale for $1.00 at the door. 

Inside the store, everybody was wearing their masks properly. I saw nobody pulling down their masks to talk and I saw no noses sticking out of masks. Social distancing was maintained as much as possible. The aisles were narrow but people were not crowding and were passing each other as quickly as reasonable. 

Most of the customers were Asian so I think that they have much better awareness of proper masking than Westerners. My takeaway is that the with proper education people will wear masks properly. They don't get reckless and disregard social distancing.

I felt very safe shopping there. I didn't have to worry about somebody sneezing in their hand in the parking lot and handling the produce. I didn't have to worry about somebody coughing or sneezing and leaving a cloud of viral particles hanging in the air inside the store. I didn't have to worry when people accidentally or unavoidably got too close.

I am an advocate of masking and what I saw last night convinces me that a sane, well thought out masking policy can be easily implemented and presents no serious difficulties for adherence.

 i know my rant is 7 months late, but it still bothers me that Ontario garbage'd all those expired n95 masks that were sitting unused after SARS old thread about this: 

background: 

how about giving them away to homeless? poor people? 

yes i get that they are far less effective due to age.....but damn , even now lots of people are still wearing surgery masks which we know are even LESS effective....and now, those expired n95s are all rotting in a landfill. LOL.

how can our health authorities be this incompetent? **and why are they still so mask-skeptical (or at least mask-hesitant)?** why continue dismissing the advice from their East Asian peers, whose governments are very publicly pro-mask? 

why do our health authorities &amp; health experts in power continue to play into the hands of anti-mask conspiracy theorists?

 Hospital wouldn't let me wear my n95 mask when I went to emergency The other day I needed to go to the emergency of a local hospital for a non-covid matter. I arrived wearing a nice genuine 3m n95 mask that fit me well hoping to avoid any covid. The triage nurse made me take it off and use one of the cheap surgical masks they all wear. I mentioned that I had a very good mask and wanted to keep it on but she insisted saying I wasn't allowed and that nobody could wear an outside mask as they weren't tested. What the ? Is that allowed? As I was in pain and not feeling the best, I didn't have much of a fight in me or normally I would have questioned her, and asked for a manager etc. to have it resolved. It just seems ludicrous that I would need to take off safe protection to have to wear something of lesser quality and not as safe. She also later told me that the virus is not areosolized so no need for a higher level of protection.

 The major cities in Alberta have decided to go the route of mandatory mask - this should now mean there does not need to be any distancing precautions, correct? Since the very beginning it was said "Masks should be worn, when it is not possible to socially distance."  


Now that we are all wearing masks, there should no longer be a requirement for having to stand 6 feet away from someone, all self-checkout tills should be open, and there should not be a reduced capacity of store fronts.

&amp;#x200B;

If the above precautions continue - why did we mandate masks?  


I find this whole situation frustrating.. Never in the history of mankind has any governments ever been considered about the well being of people. Now all of a sudden, they do not want people to die. Would they be this interested if this pandemic didn't come with a side of citizen control?

 #Masks4All: Wear a homemade mask to slow the spread of Coronavirus

 I cant believe theyre still telling people to not wear masks If as a culture we all started wearing bandana/patient masks/homemade masks we would reduce spread significantly.

We have a weird cultural boundary around doing so, however weve always put patient masks on febrile patients before going into the hospital or on contact in EMS. 

I know for a fact that government agencies are pushing the “dont wear a mask” agenda purely to avoid panic due to many people not being able to get a legitimate mask.... anything is better than nothing.

 Pretty masks So I am all for wearing a mask to protect myself from Corona, but I’ll be honest they are very tacky looking. 

Is there anywhere in Toronto I can buy some N95 with maybe a floral pattern or something cute? I like bright colours and flower patterns and these masks don’t match anything I wear! 

I am practicing social distancing but I still want too look cute when going for walks on the waterfront!

 Funny how the residents in Cottage country Ontario (Muskoka, Haliburton) were all 'don't come up here' in the Spring/early Summe, but those same locals are actually the ones not wearing masks. Dimwits. Just made my grocery run from our cottage into town, all masked up as I have always been, and I was impressed with all the cottagers wearing masks in town. What was shocking was how many locals were not wearing masks properly, and many not at all.

 Uber Makes Face Masks Mandatory for Drivers [

"Our new technology will verify if the driver is wearing a mask by asking them to take a selfie. After we verify the driver is covering their face, we’ll let the rider know via an in-app message. (Unlike our [Real-Time ID Check]( this technology detects the mask as an object in the photo, and does not process biometric information or compare mask selfies to driver photos in our database.)

In the United States, Canada, India and most of Europe and Latin America, drivers who are not wearing a mask or face cover will not be able to go online beginning next Monday, May 18. We will maintain this policy through the end of June, and then reassess based on local public health needs. We’ve designed this feature to adapt to changing public health guidance and regulations as the pandemic evolves."

"If a driver shows up without a mask on, the rider can cancel the trip without penalty, too, and report the issue to us via the app. Uber’s two-way feedback system has long helped ensure both riders and drivers uphold certain standards by requiring feedback on issues like vehicle quality, navigation, and speeding. Now, we are adding new options for feedback including having no face cover or mask. Drivers and riders who repeatedly violate mask policies risk losing access to Uber."

 We are now 6 months into this pandemic. How and why is proper PPE (masks that provide actual filtration) not in the hands of every citizen ? I appreciate cloth masks are better than nothing and do not discourage their use whatsoever - I’m probably the biggest masking advocate out their from all the way since February. I likely  one of the first non-asian people in Ontario voluntarily wearing one in public before covid was declared a pandemic. 

My concern is we have taken a band aid approach to masking (cloth masks, bandanas, ect) and let them become the norm. This is especially concerning with workplace and schools reopening. 

In Korea / China for example, the gen pop mostly wore N95 / KN94 / Kn95 from the onset of the pandemic. They clearly help. Look at the recent Starbucks outbreak in Korea where none of the staff wearing Kn rated masks contracted the virus, while 56 restaurant patrons all unmasked did. 

At mask with particulate filtration qualities costs less than $1 pre pandemic. They only cost about $2 now with inflated pricing. 

We are handing out $2000 / month for people to sit at home, huge wage subsidies, ect. Not denying these measures are necessary, but how can we not provide each citizen a couple of proper masks to wear in public settings ? Masks that are effective to the wearer, as well as those around them. 

I feel like I’m howling at the moon in my own thoughts about this. It’s so simple, yet never surfaces. It was one thing when we weren’t prepared in March, but it’s been 6 months. If we wanted to stockpile, and have adequate supply, we could have / still can? 

It seems like the best bang for your buck option to slow this thing down and reopen effectively (apart from massless settings like indoor gyms and restaurants which contradict science head on and are a pure health gamble for the sake of $$...but that’s another conversation altogether).

 HK Mask | Homemade mask with replaceable filter for reuse. Hello/Bonjour fellow Canadians,

I know that it's not the norm for people in NA to wear a mask if they feel like they are not sick, but this virus could be asymptomatic meaning you could be spreading the virus without having any common symptoms. However, for people who want to wear them, I think it's close to impossible to find them in your local pharmacy and Hong Kong people had the same difficulty and a Hong Kong chemist, [Dr. Kwong]( has developed a homemade mask called HK Mask (only needs basic sewing skills, newbies can make 1 in 3 hrs) that can use kitchen paper(s) as a filter and still reach an acceptable particle filtration efficiency (up to 91% @ 0.3um particle with 2 kitchen tissues). 

Notes:  
1) The mask needs to be sanitized by iron it every day. 

2) You are supposed to replace the filter (and the mask if possible) every 4 hours because of moisture from your breaths.

 Hospital: "Remove your mask or do not enter." As of April 6th, hospitals in Alberta, Canada **refuse entry unless you remove your own mask.** They will supply a basic surgical mask, which offers less protection than an N95. There are no exceptions if your are elderly, high risk, a healthcare worker, wear their mask on top of yours, or bring a new mask in the package and open it in hospital. It's their mask or no mask.

The fallowing was sent to me from a hospital supervisor, copy/pasted from an alleged memo by the senior practice lead and physician of infection prevention and control in the Calgary zone.

&gt;With regards to individuals at triage screening:  
&gt;  
&gt;o **If they screen ILI positive**: they should be asked to clean their hands and given a new mask and asked to wear it unless instructed by a healthcare provider to remove it during their stay. They should be asked to remove their gloves and clean their hands.  
&gt;  
&gt;o **If they screen ILI negative:** but want to wear the mask/gloves out of concern from what they have seen on the media, they should be  asked to remove their home mask, and  gloves and clean their hands and give them a hospital mask, to wear for their stay, and they should not wear gloves but clean their hands when entering and exiting the hospital/ unit if they are coming to visit an existing patient.  
&gt;  
&gt;o **If a member of the public comes in wearing a cloth mask, respirator, other mask ppe device, or even a hospital grade mask:** they should be asked to remove their mask and clean their hands and be given a hospital grade mask to wear in place of their own mask while in the facility.  
&gt;  
&gt;o **If any member of the public or staff comes in wearing gloves:** they should be asked to remove their gloves and clean their hands. They should be asked to not wear gloves while in the facility, the only exception may be in instances where the individual has draining wounds or other challenges when they cannot cover their hands with a dressing or where they cannot contain the drainage, then gloves may be valuable in assisting in containing drainage.

Is this right, or is this putting more healthcare workers and vulnerable people at higher risk?

 Wore Mask Incorrectly Please don't judge me—I got a new mask, Formedica surgical mask, and wore the first one out today but I am an idiot and wore it the wrong side out.  
I still kept my distance as much as I could. I was at an outdoor market in Montreal, so of course I was around people for about 20 minutes. How badly did I screw up? What are my chances of getting covid, or passing it on (I don't have any symptoms but we can never be 100% sure of course)?  
I am a bit panicked now as I have always been careful with my mask wearing and hardly ever go into public spaces.  
Thank you so much!

 Flying within Canada. Can you wear a full face mask? I’ll have to fly from Toronto to Vancouver for an urgent matter - probably. I don’t have n95 respirators or anything with good quality. I do have a 3M 6800 which is a full mask respirators with P100 cartridges. I used it 3 years ago when staining the house. Can I use it on the plain? I know it looks ridiculous. Would I have to take the mask off at the airport? Maybe when going through security? Alternatively I can buy a cloth mask with a filter (saw plenty of them in Amazon).

 I'm flying into Ottawa for the USports Basketball tournament? Should I cancel my flight and take the train or use lots of precaution at the airport? Hello everyone,

I am traveling to Ottawa on Fri Mar 6th in the AM...I booked a flight because the trains got canceled mid-February and I used 15K of my AMEX points to book the flight. With the coronavirus popping up, I am wondering is it smart to cancel my flight, which is 1 hour and 10 mins for a four-hour train ride? 

I spent around 600 on this trip already so I don't want to cancel. For the airport, I was considering buying a gas mask (like half-mask respirator), balaclava, hand gloves and wearing those to the airport. I also have some spare N95/N100 masks around and I am considering wearing those. I don't even think I can cancel my flight because of Air Canada apparently taking 3 weeks to respond to you. 

What seems like the best course of action?

 Opinion on wearing a mask? Hi all, as we all heard on the news with Dr. Bonnie Henry and the WHO, they have done a 180 on wearing a cloth mask. From No, to it doesn't hurt but does nothing, to well maybe, to now we recommend you wear a cloth mask to protect others around you. Many people will say this was common sense from the beginning.

Still though I still see most people not wearing one at the grocery stores here in the Metro Vancouver area. I see both sides on this one.

Firstly i'ts useful if and only if you wash your hand and face, them put it on properly, don't touch the mask as you wear it, later wash your hands, take it off, then wash your hands / face again.

Ok so obviously most people don't do all of this because it's tough and we've all seen people put their mask on their chin and even on top of their head / hair while they eat / drink. Then put it back on at that point it seem more just for show to wear a mask if you don't want to be seen not wearing one.

On the other hand the mask isn't to protect yourself but for others around you so even worst case if you dirty your own mask and still wear it the point is every breath you exhale, cough or sneeze, it's there to block it. So maybe it's still worth it in that sense?

Guys let me know what you think. Countries like Taiwan and China wear masks all the time and they say that was part of how they beat it and you have to think they are not all able to wash up before and after taking it off and not touch the mask so maybe either way it does work?

Edit: For those asking if I wear a mask.  Yes I do when I'm out for grocery shopping. I don't when I'm jogging alone in a nearby park. I don't go out for any other reasons. With that said I'm just looking for other people's thoughts on the subject and not really whether their opinion is different from my situation. After all I see people who wear a mask all the time and others who never do. Maybe each side knows something I don't so I'd like to hear from both. Thanks.

 For those who went to Patio's, what safety regulations did you follow? Might go to my local restaurants' patio tomorrow. There has been only 1 case in my area within the last 21 days, and the restaurant I am thinking of heading to is right on the cusp of a neighborhood that hasn't had cases in the last three weeks, so I am thinking ok, its probably safe to go to a patio. For those who went to patios what safety precautions did you take?

 For safety precautions I was thinking this:

1)  Wear a face shield, goggles, KN95 mask with a TrioMed face mask over. I have the triomed face mask which kills 99.99% of Covid as tested by UOFT

2)  Use Gloves, and bring Lysol Wipes along with alcohol swipes

3)  When giving order and when server brings food, step away and keep 6 ft distance

4) Eat with the face shield on

5) Replace mask after eating, and maybe wear a KN95 on my nose to block particles, but outside is pretty safe no?

 New mask restrictions The new restrictions say that in workplaces if you are able to maintain a 2 meter distance you don't have to wear a mask. 

If you are not able to maintain 2 meters and have to be next to someone closer than two meters are masks required? Employees are not within two meters 24/7, but it happens often. 

I wear a mask. I'm under the impression that maintain means.. well maintain... So if you go within two meters you are not maintaining it.

 Mask VS No Mask. We NEED TO ALL WEAR MASKS!

 Petition for Mandatory Masks in Saskatchewan I hope it's ok to post this here.  To me, wearing masks seems like such an obvious, simple way to lower the risk of transmission of Covid-19.  [It's what Health Canada recommends.](  I've been thrilled to hear about other countries, states, provinces and cities mandating masks in public indoor spaces.  But here in SK, that isn't happening.

We've had a brutal couple of days in terms of our numbers.  [Our number of known active cases have increased by 400% in less than 2 weeks.](  I'm not trying to sound alarmist, but it sounds like community spread is on the rise in Saskatchewan and things are going to get worse before they get better.  And yet masks have not been mandated.

Some people are diligently wearing their masks, but most people aren't.  People are blatantly ignoring the arrows in stores and are failing to physically distance - I've experienced it firsthand.  Some people are ignorant, some are oblivious and some are unwilling to subject themselves to a little inconvenience and discomfort to save lives.  Some just plain don't care.  Hell, my neighbor spews bullshit conspiracy theories about Bill Gates every chance he gets and has actively tried to talk my spouse and me out of wearing masks.  Because it's "not as bad" here as in other places or no one they personally know has caught it, a lot of people seem to think Covid-19 isn't a threat.

**Bottom line: most people here aren't going to wear masks unless they're forced to.**

The Saskatchewan Nurse's Union [has been begging for a mask mandate](  The Saskatchwan Medical Association [is calling on people to wear masks]( Countless people who work with the public wish masks were mandatory.

I decided to start a petition.  My hope is I can take it to decision makers in this province and use it to apply a little more pressure to them to mandate masks.  Maybe it will help or maybe it won't, but I have to try.  I'm hoping to reach 1,000 signatures, but I'll be contacting those in charge on Monday regardless as I don't want to wait too long.

**If you live in SK and care about reducing our number of active cases...**

**If you don't want people from SK spreading Covid-19 to your area when they travel...**

**If you care about sparing other human beings from preventable illness and death...**

**Please sign and consider sharing on social media.**

Thank you and stay safe!

 Can someone explain why Dr Bonnie Henry (BC's top doc) is going against not only some of her colleagues, but also an increasing body of scientific evidence that shows the crucial role that Mandatory Masks play in diminishing infection? 
she gives her reasons why masks shouldn't be mandatory, 







&gt; However, Henry maintained that wearing masks for a long period of time like a full school day is “**not recommended by anybody in any situation,**” and is “**not what keeps people safe**." 

...


&gt; Dr. Henry says she wears a mask indoors and strongly encourages others to do the same, **but because Metro Vancouver’s COVID-19 numbers are much lower than Toronto’s, she doesn’t think it needs to be mandated.**

...

&gt; Henry says the province has stopped short of mandating the use of masks out of concern for those who would have difficulty wearing one.
&gt; 
&gt;  "There are some people for whom mask wearing is not a viable option," she said. "**(Such as) anyone for whom it is difficult to take it on on themselves, young children, people with disabilities, it can very much a challenge."**



but then seems to contradict herself: 

&gt; Henry said while the number of COVID-19 cases in B.C. doesn't warrant a similar law, it may be needed in the future.

&gt;  But with a second wave expected in the fall, that doesn’t mean masks won’t become mandatory at some point down the road. 
&gt; 
&gt; "We may, if we end up during respiratory season with a surge, it may become more of a directive that we will require people to wear masks in some indoor situations, if we we start to see a lot of more transmission in our communities," said Henry. "But we are not at that point right now."




&gt; As BC continues through Phase 3 of its restart plan, more people are using transit to get where they need to go. And this week, Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said **“absolutely everybody” on transit should be wearing a mask.**
&gt; 
&gt; “**I absolutely think everybody on transit should be wearing a mask – everybody who can,**” she said during a press conference. “If you are taking transit right now, you should be wearing a face covering unless there’s a very valid reason you can’t.”

ok, i have to ask: firstly, if the concern is "some people have breathing disabilities" , then how does that concern disappear (or become less important) just cuz the transmission gets worse than present? 

secondly, shouldn't people who already have breathing difficulties have a GREATER motivation for masking?  



...and it seems like she's increasingly one of the lone holdouts:


&gt; On Tuesday, Toronto City Council approved a temporary bylaw to enforce the use of face masks and coverings for indoor public spaces in an effort to reduce the spread of COVID-19.

...

&gt; BC Ferries says passengers will be required to travel with a face mask on most routes starting June 15 and must wear the mask while on board if a physical distance of two metres cannot be maintained.

...

&gt; In just over 10 days, Calgarians will be required to wear a mask or face covering whenever they enter an indoor public space within the city, and Mayor Naheed Nenshi is encouraging people to get on board ahead of time.




Finally, it looks like there are docs who disagree: 





&gt; Even though B.C.’s COVID numbers remain low, **a Vancouver-born doctor with a nationwide group called Masks4Canada would like to see an indoor mask requirement, suggesting a province-wide rule would work better than the city-by-city approach in Ontario.** 
&gt; 
&gt; "Dr. Henry’s done an amazing job, as has all of British Columbians," said Dr. Amy Tan. "What we would like to see is, because the numbers are so low in B.C., we want to keep the numbers down, especially now as you guys are in phase three now and reopening the economy." 


...and also (just like elsewhere), the vast majority of BCers support making masks mandatory, including parents: 



&gt; B.C.’s top doctor says face masks will not be mandated at schools in September
&gt; 
&gt; A number of other Canadian jurisdictions have implemented mandatory mask policies for indoor public spaces.
&gt; 
&gt; There appears to be growing support for mandatory mask measures in B.C.
&gt; 
&gt; **A recent poll found 73 per cent of B.C. parents support a mask mandate for their children, when they return to school.**




and really, some of her reasoning sounds like something out of a Trump supporter's mouth.  I am really surprised. 


are we (me, you, all these other doctors &amp; other cities) missing something, that Bonnie is not missing?  And when i say "other doctors", i'm also thinking about the health experts in Asia (SK, VN, SG, TW, JP, CN, etc etc) along some Western cities &amp; jurisdictions, who chose to mandate masks .....what are they all missing, that Bonnie is not missing?

**Where can you buy surgical masks ?**

These days so many people are so anxious, scared of the COVID-19 or novel coronavirus that’s quickly spreading around the world. It has already infected hundreds of thousands of people. While people who have recovered from the disease far outnumber the deaths, the number of infected people continues to rise.

People now have a new appreciation of medical protective gear like medical face masks to help prevent the spread of infection, and of medical devices like infrared thermometers that help detect infection. The demand for these items is so high that there appears to be a worldwide shortage at the moment.

So, where do you buy these face masks and infrared thermometers? Where else but China, of course.

**Where to purchase medical face mask and infrared thermometer in china**

**Alibaba: Online**

Known as the Amazon of China, Alibaba is the leading wholesale mobile marketplace for global trade.

**Xiantao: China’s main production center of masks**

Xiantao is a city in Central China’s Hubei province known to be the country’s leading production center of face masks and a significant local medical equipment manufacturing base.

The city is a major industrial hub for non-woven products used in surgical masks. Among the manufacturers are Xiantao Yinhong Protective Products Co. Ltd, Hubei Safeway Protective Products Co., Xiantao Zhongtai Protective Products, to name a few.

**Sourcing agent**

At this time, there’s an urgent need worldwide to source medical masks and infrared thermometers in large quantities. No one has the luxury of time to do thorough research on each supplier they read on a list.

The best and fastest way to find trusted suppliers is to hire a sourcing agent from China.

A sourcing agent will help you find quality face masks and infrared thermometers at the best factory price. Your sourcing agent will act as your representative in China, executing your orders and negotiating with suppliers and shipping companies, and taking care of needed documentation.

&amp;#x200B;

**What is the best type of surgical masks**

**N95**

Commonly used in healthcare settings, an N95 respirator is a “single-use,” disposable respiratory protective device that blocks at least 95% of tiny (0.3 micron) test particles when properly fitted. The N 95 respirator is usually worn by healthcare professionals during procedures to protect both patient and healthcare staff from the transfer of microorganisms, body fluids, and particulate material.

Respirators come in various sizes and must be individually selected to fit the wearer’s face and to provide a tight seal.

&amp;#x200B;

**Surgical Masks**

A surgical mask is a loose-fitting, disposable medical device that serves as a physical barrier between the nose and mouth of the wearer, and possible contaminants in the immediate surrounding.

When worn correctly, surgical masks help block large particle droplets, splashes, sprays, or splatter that may contain germs (viruses and bacteria), keeping it from reaching the mouth and nose.

 Dr. Horacio Harruda's opinion on homemade masks #maskfor all A journalist brought up the question of masks to Dr. Harruda in the context of #masksforall.  This is a loose translation of what he said.

Can you guarantee that masks for all do not have a benefit?
Do you discourage people from wearing a mask?

* This is an interesting question that is being discussed at the moment

* The context is important. Since we are short of masks, here and elsewhere masks must be put to use where they are most useful.
* Even if we had millions of masks, they should never replace proper hand hygiene.  If you are wearing a mask and touching contaminated objects, but feel protected, this is harmful.
* But this idea is being analyzed at the moment.  This is very new.
Mask can be useful to increase social distancing as people do not know if you are sick or not.
* What will we do when we have millions of masks to give away we will see, but right now we cannot.
* Would a mask made of thick fabric help decrease the spread of droplets.  Potentially yes, but not at the same level as a surgical mask.
* We are going to look into it, but one thing is for certain, this will never replace social distancing.
* Will masks worn in public be a crucial element in the fight against this virus? maybe it can contribute, in various ways both physical and psychological 
* *Then he forgets that the question is about homemade masks and reiterates that they need to be reserved for the front line medical staff.  The journalist reminds him that the question is about homemade masks that would decrease transmission of droplets.*
* If someone wants to make homemade masks, he sees no issues with it, if that makes them feel more protected.  As long as that person remembers to practice perfect hand hygiene and keep up the other measures which he considers more important than masks.

 G&amp;M: Dr. Tam’s about-face on masks damages trust at a crucial time Last week, Canada’s top doctor said that if we’re not sick, or haven’t been around someone with a confirmed case of COVID-19, we shouldn’t wear a mask. “Putting a mask on an asymptomatic person is not beneficial, obviously if you’re not infected,” she said.

This week, Dr. Theresa Tam did a complete about-face: actually, the use of non-medical masks can help to control the spread of COVID-19, she said. “Wearing a non-medical mask, even if you have no symptoms, is an additional measure that you can take to protect others around you in situations where physical distancing is difficult to maintain, such as in public transit or maybe in the grocery store.”

In normal times, a week is not a long time for a public health official to totally reverse a previous policy recommendation. But when the world is in the midst of a deadly pandemic, when a cough from one unknowingly infected person can lead to exponential numbers of infections, a week is a painfully long time.

Countless Canadians have been taking transit, working essential jobs or stopping into stores for necessary food and medicine – all with their mouths and noses uncovered, heeding what was then the advice of Canada’s Chief Public Health Officer. There’s no way of knowing how much virus was shed during that time.

Dr. Tam’s earlier contention that masks are useless on asymptomatic people was outdated the moment she said it. (To be fair, the World Health Organization still maintains masks are only necessary for healthy people when taking care of a sick person.)

A letter published by a group of physicians in Germany in late January outlined a case of apparent transmission during the incubation period. A case study from February chronicled an asymptomatic 20-year-old Wuhan woman who infected five of her relatives without ever developing symptoms. Research published in March suggested that undocumented infections (meaning not-yet-diagnosed, mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic carriers) were the source of nearly 80 per cent of documented COVID-19 cases. All of that material was published before Dr. Tam said, in late March, that “there is no need to use a mask for well people.”

The purpose of a mask on an asymptomatic person is less to protect the wearer from everyone else than it is to protect everyone else from the wearer. That’s why, in a public health emergency, widespread adoption of masks is so important. It’s also why other countries, including Austria, South Korea, Slovakia, Czech Republic, to name a few, began coupling physical distancing directives with recommendations to wear masks in public weeks or months ago.

There are handfuls of studies of varying scopes and methods that suggest that even homemade masks (which, importantly, preserve medical masks for front line personnel) offer some benefit in mitigating viral shedding. And while it is true that precise characteristics of the virus is not yet fully understood, a weighing of available evidence – on the nature of COVID-19 spread, on the efficacy of masks and on our recent proclivity toward adopting as many preventative measures as possible – should have made a recommendation for face masks in Canada a no-brainer.

When pressed by journalists Monday, Dr. Tam attributed her reversal to a review of evolving evidence. Yet it is unclear to which precise evidence she refers, and why that evidence was more compelling than the collection of previous published research.

There may have been some concern from public health authorities that recommending masks for general use would have sent people snapping up medical masks, depleting supply. Dr. Tam also alluded to the idea that masks can confer a sense of invincibility; that mask-wearers might feel “protected” enough to ease up physical distancing guidelines. But both issues can be neutered with clear, unequivocal public health instructions: Here’s how you wear your mask. Here’s how you take it off. Here’s what you don’t do while wearing a mask. And please, homemade masks only.

In a time of crisis, the public’s faith in those calling the shots is absolutely critical. Health authorities are asking a lot of people – to stay home, to avoid seeing friends and family, to eliminate so many simple, easy pleasures. If people can’t trust the individuals issuing the directives, they will be far less inclined to follow their instructions.

Dr. Tam has backtracked before – on the risk posed to Canadians by COVID-19, on the usefulness of travel restrictions and, now, on the efficacy of masks for asymptomatic individuals. And while we can’t expect health authorities to be omniscient, we can expect them to be direct, to explain their work, to produce their evidence and to offer some humility when they get things wrong. That can go a long way in establishing, or repairing, trust. Dr. Tam has some work to do.

 "They really try to talk people out of buying the mask, because they’re not recommended. People are much better off getting their flu shot, because they’re at a much higher risk of getting influenza" - Barry Power Feb 13th 2020

“Wearing masks when you’re well is not an effective measure. Sometimes it can actually present some risks, as you’re putting your fingers up and down on your face, removing your mask, putting them next to your eyes,” - Dr. Tam


“Rising demand for face masks is something health-care workers in Canada are carefully tracking. Any of that can change if we start seeing a large volume of cases, so that’s why it’s important for people not to be using masks and supplies unnecessarily,”  Dr. Susy Hota

 - Hota noted there is currently no problem with the supply for surgical masks in Canadian health care facilities.

- Similar advice has been given by the World Health Organization, which says healthy individuals only need to wear a mask if they are caring for someone who is sick.

- Earlier this week, Health Minister Patty Hajdu told reporters that Canada does have a stockpile of masks for domestic use, saying her department is monitoring the rumblings of a supply chain shortage.

 For gods sakes, can someone confirm if we’re supposed to wear masks? So I was basically just attacked by two “friends” I game with who claim were not supposed to wear masks. One of them even screen shared a link that showed someone had “debunked” non medical professionals wearing them. But now a bit of googling and the closest thing I could find was Theresa Tam recently said “you can wear a mask **if you want**”. Not exactly a ringing endorsement. Yet at the same time apparently Los Angeles is now recommending **everyone** wear one. So what the hell is the takeaway here? My anxiety is already through the roof here, in completely torn going outside whether I’m being paranoid, irresponsible, something in between, etc. **Please HELP!**

 Coronavirus FAQs: Is A Homemade Mask Effective? And What's The Best Way To Wear One? 
++++++++++
 Everyone, let's make and wear homemade masks. Hear me out. This works. There is evidence that wearing masks stops or at least reduces transmission both from infected people and helps stop people from being infected.

Obviously an infinite number of N95 masks would be ideal, but ANY MASK made of suitable material is better than nothing. 

There are many online tutorials showing what works for homemade masks. It's better than nothing.

If everyone wore them, EVERYONE, in public, it would reduce the spread by asymptomatic carriers, and make everyone safer. 

Why doesn't if have to be perfect? If a mask on an asymptomatic carrier is 80% effective, and the mask on the potential newly infected person is 80% effective it virtually ensures the transmission will not take place. 

This is being done in the Czech Republic they went to 100% adherence of wearing face masks and it really seems to be working.

To me this is our best chance of flattening the curve. But if people agree we need not just government directive social media influencers and famous athletes and actors and famous people to make it cool and we can change this.

 My take on why the public should wear masks. 1. Because masks protects against the corronavirus, otherwise why would health workers would wear them?
2. We are told that if the public wears mask they might have greater chance to infect themselves due to manipulation. I don't know about you, but if there is virus on my mask and i risk infecting myself while touching my mask, its because if i didn't have a mask i would have the virus in that same area around my mouth, in which case it is quite obviously worst. Instead why don't they teach the public how to safely use a mask?
3. The only valid reason we are told not to wear mask is because there is not enough masks for our medical workers. I believe this to be true, but then if that is the case, why don't your government pass a law to make mask selling to the public illegal and at the same time force theses sellers to sell all their stock to the government? By now, mask rationing is already in place in healthcare facilities, and if the government had the intention of really fixing the problem by buying all publicly available mask, they would have done so already. They would have built up a team of buyers to scour shops and internet to get all theses mask. So basically any mask you do not buy to protect yourself is simply a lost mask, a public protection lost.
4. Mask might seems unuseful if we all self isolate, but the truth is that it is yet a soft lockdown, people are still going at the very least to grocery store and pharmacies, and these are infection vectors. Our usage of mask at this moment should be very low as it is required only if someone goes out for theses reasons. Also if you have an infected member of your family at home you'd better have some mask pre-available, because you sure wouldn't want to infect other family members and at the same time bring the number of infected vectors up.
5. It is true that in a perfect world only infected peoples would wear masks, but do you live in a perfect world? I don't. The problem with that theory is that infected persons do not show symptoms right away and it ca take up to 14 days for symptoms to show up, in which case that person is an infection vector until then. And the moment they do realize or not that they are infected, you have to trust that person judgement and capacity to avoid contact with others, easier said than done. Some infected people will still need to get out for food and medicines, or even their family members which again could have become infected unknowingly. And again, the infected person will need masks, where will they get it if they haven't bought it already? The health care system will give them? But aren't they already low on stocks? Which bring us back to buying the stock the healthcare does not have hold of, the one in store or online that our needing government have not taken measure to get a hold of.

Until our government show its intention to buy all theses publicly available stock, and god knows they had the time to do so, i suggest everyone should have a few available masks, and not stockpile them, think of others, mask sitting in your home unused is a waist. Do not be let down by the stigma imposed on us that, if you wear a mask, you must then be infected. At the same time see the positive effect of this current stigma, if you wear a mask, at least you have good chances that strangers will keep physically distant.

Regarding mask usage, make your research on what are the medical guideline for their safe usages and manipulations.

According to some study the use of homemade mask is better than no mask at all, we are talking of possibly 60% effective compared with 95% effective for N95 types. Do not take my word for granted do your own research.   


Personally i am contemplating reusing my few mask by doing a rotation, where i use mask #1 and once done put it out in a dry sunny place for a period of 10 days so that UV rays can cure them, then go to mask #2 and so on. But don't follow my advice, do your research!  


Also, UVC lights and microwaves could be field of research on how to reuse masks. There is limited information out there, but it really worth exploring.

Get informed, many countries which use mask happens to have a better control over the infection rates, but that could be due to other factors, but using common sense i am pretty sure it help them to some degree, although in itself it cannot be THE only strategy.

First and foremost practice physical distancing, but when you have no choice to go out for essential needs, protect yourself and others by any means.

 They’re talking about needing to wear non-medical face masks for when we go back to school. So does that mean we can’t wear the single use blue ones you get in a pack of like 50 because they don’t qualify as “non-medical”? So only reusable cloth face masks are allowed? If this is the case then why? Aren’t the medical ones more effective? Why are we asked to wear the non-medical ones?

 2nd hand smoke and the mask mandate I just read that 1.2 million people die of 2nd hand smoke every year.     I understand the governments good intent with the mask mandate.   But does anybody think we might be going a bit overboard?    How many homeless people are going to wear masks?   Are we going to throw them in jail?       They won't even stay in shelters...what makes us think we can convince them to wear a mask?      And for that matter...smoking kills 4 times more people than covid.   Yet nobody is going to throw a smoker in jail.    For that matter, alcohol as well.    The government actually makes profit from selling alcohol and cigarettes.    Also, there are people that just don't have the same beliefs about the virus, that the main stream people do.    Can we really dictate what they are and aren't supposed to believe?   I don't agree with the conspiracy theories.   But can we say some one can't buy food or clothes because they don't agree with us?

 COVID-19: Why We Should All Wear Masks — There Is New Scientific Rationale 
++++++++++
 Can we reconsider the dialogue on wearing valved masks? The argument is that the valved mask doesn't do enough to protect others around you. The highest quality safest masks though tend to be the valved ones, they do a great job at protecting you but in the interest of breathing comfortably there is a way to expend the air when you exhale. They are overwhelmingly better at protecting you though, and as this is primarily an airborne virus, they are basically the best and easiest ways to protect yourself.

Let's say that  
`p` is the chance of you getting infected  
`q` is the chance if you infecting others  
`r` is the chance of you not knowing you are sick  
`y` is the severity of the damage you cause by infecting others in situations where you would wear a mask  
`z` is the severity of the damage you would cause infecting others regardless of typical mask use, such as passing it on to family and housemates because you don't wear a mask at home  

The damage you cause then, is something like:  
`p*r*(q*y + z)`

With a non-valved mask, q is reduced compared to with a valved mask. The thing is though, that only applies when you are sick and don't know it, so most of the time that you are wearing a surgical mask you are only signalling that you aren't spreading it 'in the event that you are sick'. Non-valved masks reduce q a reasonable amount, but valved masks reduce p a very significant amount, possibly by an order of magnitude.

With a typical valved mask, p is a very very small number. It brings chances of you getting sick in the first place so low, that it minimizes any sort of damage you could cause from getting sick. It's not a question of "my mask is there to protect you, your mask is there to protect me", it's a matter of practically eliminating the chance of you getting sick from that sort of interaction. Since the chances of you getting sick are so much lower, you are still doing more good than the 'harm reduction' you are doing by wearing a surgical mask to signal that others are safe from you.

Does that make sense? I think that the best masks out there happen to be valved masks, so we shouldn't tell people not to wear the valved ones, they're the absolute best at protecting you, and therefore the best at protecting others by extension of you not getting sick in the first place. The net effect seems overwhelmingly better.
