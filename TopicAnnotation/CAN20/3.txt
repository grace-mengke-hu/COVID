 What do I do?! I’m at a loss right now with how to handle my situation. I’ll lay the facts out point blank. Any suggestions and/or fact based info would be really appreciated. 

- 38 year old Type 1 diabetic
- Live in a basement suite connected to the main floor via open stairwell.
- Mother and Her partner live in the upstairs suite. 
- Very family oriented and still eat meals together. We drink coffee together, etc. 
- Mother has several diseases that fall into an Auto-Immune deficiency spectrum. 
- Both her and I are more prone to the fatal aspects of the Coronavirus.
- I share my son every second week with his mother. 
- I am currently on my 3rd day of vacation which was planned before any of this had exploded. 
- My boss called me today and asked me if I was going to go on Employment Sick benefits or come back to work. 
- I am the frontline go-to guy for our business which is Musical Instrument retail. Even with our prevention guidelines, more people are wanting to buy instruments while self isolating or in quarantine. 
- NO MATTER WHAT YOU TELL PEOPLE THEY STILL HANDLE ITEMS. AND COUGH!!!!
- If I go on EI I will make significantly less than I do with a paycheque from work, but will then be even further in debt and may not be able to hold out for very long

If I follow all of the precautionary ways of prevention, am I making the right call.

 What happens if gym member is positive? What happens if someone tests positive at a gym that I attend and was there while I was?

If I am contacted by the local health unit, will I be required to get tested? Required to isolate?

 My 3-year-old niece decided her best friend is one of the cashiers she sees at Safeway all the time. The cashier had been sick and this was the first time they had seen each other in 2 weeks.

 Quarantine Questions from US My fiancé (from Toronto) is planning on visiting me in the US from Sept 1 - Sept 21st. We have a couple questions about the 14-day quarantine plan for visitors into Canada. See below:

1) right now, it just says the mandatory quarantine is until August 31st. While he still plans to quarantine immediately after coming back to Canada, will the mandatory quarantine be extended beyond 8/31? 

2) He lives with his parents but has his own room where he will be staying for most, if not all of the time he’s in quarantine. However, there is only one bathroom in their apartment, is this okay if he cleans and disinfects the bathroom after every use? 

Thank you in advance

 We all have that "one" friend who is a little slow to understand what #StayTheFuckHome actually means.

 PSA - Federal government have no jurisdiction or power over education or healthcare - they can't close anything down including businesses not federally regulated Ive been reading posts on here and it seems majority of posters do not understand that we have two tier of govt (feds and provincial, municipal are created of provincial). People seem to be under the impression the feds can close schools or work places or businesses etc...

The feds can't do it because they don't have the power to. Things like schools and healthcare are provincial jurisdiction. School closures can only be done by province or local school boards. 

I highly suggest supposed Canadians get educated about the various levels of govt before posting

 Majority of BC residents worried about coronavirus, but few making big changes to habits Article from local news site in BC:

*"British Columbians are increasingly worried about the new coronavirus pandemic, but few have changed their behaviour much since it arrived in the province.* 

*That’s according to an updated poll by Insights West, which asked a representative sample of just under a thousand residents about the virus last weekend.* 

*Nearly half (48%) of the people in the province are now following developments of the virus closely, compared to 34% in February.* 

*Only 10% are not following the story, according to the poll. "*

Poll is linked below:

Also from a local news source, The President of Doctors BC, Dr. Kathleen Ross said that the flu is currently worse, but how does she know? As far as I know we aren't even testing for it...

*"Ross says B.C. Doctors have been busy dealing with the end of flu season and now have their hands full with questions from patients looking for answers about the coronavirus.*

*"There's a lot of unknowns in the public right now and that has led to more fear about this, but the reality is, we have way more cases of influenza in B.C. right now than we have incidents of coronavirus."*

[

I think the chances that it is running rampant in our city are high, and no one is getting tested so we just don't know. I would think in the next week or so we will start seeing more cases locally and everyone will have wished they were a little more cautious instead of just buying up all the toilet paper! It doesn't help when we have health professionals saying that we have more cases of the flu right now.
