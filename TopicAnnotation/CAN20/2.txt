 Need help with company I work for I currently work for a tool and die company and if anyone knows anything about how some small shops work they believe they are above the law. My company is looking into making respirators for Canada. I think this is a great idea and am ready to work as much as necessary. Information is starting to come out that this will only take up 5% of the shops operations. So they are doing this just to stay open and continue to work on their tools. What can I do?

 To those who are now working from home - be as productive as you can and maybe after this is all done employers will realize WFH is a great option! I suspect many employers begrudgingly allowed their staff to work from home due to the virus. But this is our opportunity to prove to them that it can work! (Well, in many jobs, not all obviously) but if you're one of those, remember that this is your time to make a change! Imaging if after all this more people were working from home! It would be great!

 What qualifies Patty Hajdu to be health minister and in charge of handling this crisis, also why isn’t a Canadian infectious disease specialist in charge? Shouldn’t we give the reigns to the expert instead of a graphic designer!

 Registered with ArriveCAN app, but told I do not need to quarantine. How to proceed? Registered with arrivecan app, but told no need to quarantine.... what to do?

So I picked up a rescue dog from the US border. We met volunteers that picked the dogs up from the airport. The dogs came from from Mexico.

Note we met in the park, and at no time did I go through the US border. Never even entered a building or was within 6 feet of anyone.

Well we were told we would have to quarantine ahead of time just because we were in the park and had to take the dogs to the Canada Customs. So I filled out the ArriveCAN app. But I guess it’s entirely depends on the border agent. Border agent seemed pissed we were at customs because were never in the states. He said No Quarantine. I even confirmed with him.

The problem is that because I was proactive I’m now getting notifications to Quarantine from the App. Fuck me for being proactive! There is no way to cancel my arrivecan submission now. Also the app barely works. Some of the buttons like the Get Help button are inactive.

So my question is: do you the border agents give quarantine paperwork if you are required?

Essentially if I get caught not in quarantine, all I have is the word of an angry border agent. I called a corona virus number and she confirmed I don’t need to quarantine... but again I only have the word of someone not super knowledgeable on the phone. I’ve since sent an email hoping to get some written proof.

BTW: please note I’m not being irresponsible. I work from home and have been extremely covid safe. I don’t have any plan to travel. I just want to know I can go to a park, grocery store, etc.

TLDR: does the government give/keep quarantine paperwork to those required to quarantine when you entered?
