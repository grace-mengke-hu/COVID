 Childrens' COVID severe outcome tracking in Canada I understand that this is not a very positive topic but I wanted to create this thread as there are some worrying trends in the data that point to more cases than we know about.

Firstly, there are sporadic reports of MIS-C and there doesn't seem to be anyone tracking these cases.

Secondly, the deaths are not being reported officially in a timely manner.  We know one death occurred in August a [19 year old in Quebec]( however, that death is not reflected in the official numbers.  Data from [ shows an additional 2-3 deaths in Quebec in 2-17 year olds from April/May posted in the past week and 1 MIS-C case in Alberta.  Ontario has a report of a child who died [with COVID but not of COVID](  There have been reports of children drowning in the bathtub from febrile seizures in the US with diagnosed/undiagnosed COVID.  There is also [an official death in a child with COVID in Ontario]( the only death in the National system and the report goes to great lengths to ensure all we know is the child was under 10.

With all this data, there could be 4-6 deaths in children under 20 in Canada with close to 11,000 positive tests.

The public needs to know what the real story is here so if anyone has any further insight or links to articles, please post it.
