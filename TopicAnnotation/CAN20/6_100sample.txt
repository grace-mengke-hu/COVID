 Looking for a good One-Sheet / Infographic Hey guys, I'm looking for a good sheet of info on covid-19 that emphasizes the importance of social distancing and the risk to older folk. My 85 year old grandmother is a little bit confused and also hates being cooped up in her house, and will probably go out to the mall or grocery store either out of boredom or routine. 

Maybe this is not genuine of me but I want to post a sheet on her apartment building bulletin board and put one in her mailbox as if everybody got one. She worked as a nurse for years and although she is very strong willed, she does take doctors' medical advice seriously, and having an info sheet on her fridge would help greatly!

 Can I travel to move? So I currently live in Toronto and looking to move to Oslo, Norway this year. If, let's say, by end of the year we are still being told that "all non-essential travel is prohibited" can I still make my move if Norway opens up its borders? I guess I want to make sure that if I pack up my stuff, buy a one-way plane ticket and give my landlord notice and my employer notice that I'm leaving, I don't want to be turned away at the airport. Does anyone know if I'm allowed to leave at any point?

 Lost my job in February So..I got fired due to my mental health in late February. Since I was fired I do not qualify for EI. I'm concerned about applying for CERB as it states you need to have lost your job due to the virus or due to reasons out of my control. 

Would anyone consider mental health a reason out of my control? I was on the verge of ending my life and missed alot of work..

 CERB is a failure. We don't need more bureaucratic political bullshit. 

I understand that the Government had to make a quick call in a time of crisis. However adding another administrative regulatory social program is utterly a step in the wrong direction. Arbitrary cut-offs, awkward timelines, random eligibility rules, non universal coverage, etc. Disorientation is not what we need during a crisis.   

Now Trudeau is looking at options for those that are not eligible under the CERB criteria; students, low income, gig workers, etc. So I fully expect to see the SCERB and LICERB and GWCERB coming shortly; all with their own political administrative bullshit. I don't even want to think about the administrative costs associated with the CERB and the subsequent "auditing" that will need to be completed. Administrative waste of tax dollars in the hundreds of millions. 

Just cut all the bureaucratic political bullshit and implement UBI already. Roll all the goddamn social programs into one. CPP, EI, CERB, OAS, CCB, VDP, QPP, QPIP, you're running out of acronyms Canada. Cut this shit out. 

This is a golden opportunity to LEAN our social operations. Instead the Government has decided to maximize waste and increase unnecessary processing and activities that don't add value. Let's convolute. Let's impede. Let's confuse.

 Could cruise ships be repurposed as coastal quarentine locations or field hospitals? So we all know that the cruise industry has pretty much grinded to a halt and that would mean there should be a lot of ships just sitting idle.  What if cruise ships were leased to governments to be used as field hospitals? 

&amp;nbsp;

I read a lot about other countries that are in a further state of spread and how the lack of beds force people to be crowded close quarters into hospital hallways.  China decided to build a 1000 bed hospital in 10 days and convert gyms and large spaces into field hospitals just to try and cope with the amount of patients.  If Wuhan was on the coast would a ship have been ready to accept patients sooner? 

&amp;nbsp;

I know cruise ships don't have a good record containing spread but it seems like it could work if infection control specialists were put in charge to make necessary modifications instead of regular staff running things. 

&amp;nbsp;

 A large cruise ship can have ~3000 cabins so say they only used every third room to keep people spaced out.  That would still be a lot of beds. 

&amp;nbsp;

Thoughts?

 Might not be eligible for COVID benefits program due to unique situation, what are my best options? I've got a bit of a unique situation and was hoping someone could weigh in on what my best options are. I was working a part-time minimum wage job while going to school, and as I was set to graduate this April, I voluntarily quit a week or two before COVID really started to pick up steam, in order to give myself more time to apply for full-time positions in my field for after graduation. If anyone has been on the job hunt for computer science/software development related work, you'll know its practically a full-time job in itself. Obviously if I had foreseen the current situation I would never have quit, but now I'm in the tough position of potentially not being eligible for the benefits program while also not being able to find any work since many companies have stopped hiring, especially for entry level and new grad positions. I have yet to apply for either COVID benefits or EI as I don't strictly fit the eligibility criteria for either, and I figured that having a denied application on my record would not do me any favours. It'd be nice to talk to someone knowledgeable, but since the hotlines are flooded and there are no physical locations open, I'm resorting to reddit. Any suggestions on my best course of action? Thanks!

 Well, there goes my internship... I'm a student due to graduate in April. I recently nabbed a very competitive paid internship at a development firm and started there part-time two weeks ago. Today they released a voluntary work from home policy for their employees, and they sent me a 'heads up' email letting me know they:  
\- expect business as usual next week and to come in for my hours  
\- but should the situation escalate and they have to implement a company wide work-from-home strategy, my internship would be suspended.  


As a student this is my only income, besides being a tutor to fellow students (and with the social distancing, THAT income is definitely going away too). My career is about to be derailed, I'm completely crushed because I've worked extremely (I am also a young parent) hard to get to this point. I really hope Trudeau introduces measures to help with rent/bills/food and that they don't just apply to people who qualify for EI. Besides my monthly childtax benefit, I will have no other income and I don't want to be homeless on top of everything else.   


I'm very worried and anxious.

 I am a healthcare worker, here is my plea Over the next few weeks, the *majority* of us are going to get the virus.  Thousands will panic and go to the hospital when it is NOT A TRUE EMERGENCY.  By doing this you will be exhausting staff and supplies. 

The truth is what you can expect when going to the hospital is to have your temperature taken before being seated in a room for 12-24 hours, all while feeling miserably ill, and being exposed to all the other sick people before you are evaluated. If you are not actively dying from respiratory distress or febrile seizures, you will be told to go home and self-isolate.     If you are not seriously ill, you may not even be tested.    There is little point going to the hospital unless you are experiencing a medical emergency (uncontrollable fever, seizure, trouble breathing, etc)

If you think you have COVID-19, the safest thing for you and everyone else to do is stay home.  Tell your employer and friends that you are experiencing symptoms and are self-isolating as a precaution.  Stay home unless you are experiencing a medical emergency.   We need all staff and supplies available for those who cannot breathe on their own, we need staff and supplies for the everyday emergency patients who are having heart attacks, car accidents, and strokes.  


TL; DR:  STAY HOME. Do not go to hospital unless experiencing a medical emergency. You will be sent home anyways.  Try to cope at home as long as you can. 

Am happy to verify my identity privately to mods.

 Someone asked to me explain why social distancing is important, and why they should bother if they aren't "afraid". This was the best I could come up with. They said I should put that on the internet or something. So here I am. Steering from the back window! The best analogy I can come up with to help understand ‚Äúwhere we are at‚Äù with the COVID-19 crisis on the Earth is this:

Imagine you are riding in a car.   You can not see out the front window of the car.   You can only see out the back window.

Now imagine that car is driving very quickly into a forest fire.

There is a narrow, winding road though the fire, and we‚Äôre all on it right now (in the car) but we don‚Äôt know which way to turn the car - one bad turn and we‚Äôre stuck and in the ditch, burning instead of getting through it.

Everyone in the car has a tiny little hand brake that slows the car by only a few km per hour, a fraction of it‚Äôs current speed (FAST!).

The numbers we keep reading about?   The new cases?  Deaths?  Growth rates?...all of that?

That‚Äôs what we see out the back window.    

But, where we are now is the front bumper of the car (the present)!

We can‚Äôt see out the front windshield, but you know damn well the front bumper is infinitely worse than what you are currently seeing out the back of the car.  

You just know you‚Äôd rather be at the back of the car, than the front, right?

Now, each of those ‚Äúmini-brakes‚Äù I mentioned?    

THOSE are YOU social distancing yourself.   Specifically, STAYING THE FUCK HOME!  Traveling and interacting with others only when there is just no other way!

Now collectively, we can all slow the car down, so we can effectively steer (by looking out the back window) through this forest fire called COVID-19.

The slower we go, the quicker we can respond to trends in the road, and surrounding area, or to the spread of the infection, and the treatment of the ill, and very ill.

By not pulling your brake and allowing the car to move quickly, then the more chance we have of crashing the car into the forest fire itself instead of staying on the road and getting through it.

So do your part, pull on your tiny hand-brake as hard as you can and help us slow this car down so we can drive it through this horrific event instead of right into it, okay?

Together.

As a species, not as countrymen.

 Reactivate an existing EI claim or start a new one? I'm sure there may be other people in this situation. Looking to provide a little help to those in need and hopefully someone has 

I have been working contracts. I finished a contract in the middle of October and submitted an EI claim. I found a new contract pretty quickly which I started at the beginning of December. I only collected four or five weeks. They ended my contract early last week because of the virus. Gave me fair severance so I am ok for a little while. Just trying to figure out next steps. 

On the EI website they state:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;If you started a new EI claim within the last 52 weeks and there are still weeks payable on that claim, **we will automatically reactivate (renew) your existing claim.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**However, in some cases, it may be to your advantage to cancel or end your old claim earlier and start a new claim, because this may increase the amount of your benefits or the length of your benefit period**.  
&gt;  
&gt;You must decide whether or not to cancel or renew a claim based on your own personal situation. 

For me the question is whether or not applying again would lengthen my benefit period. 

There isn't really enough information provided on the site to make an informed decision on this. 

The site states that once you have started a new claim you cannot reactivate your old claim. So I have reactivated the old claim for now. My employer isn't submitting my ROE until Tuesday. I know I could have demanded the ROE and final payment more quickly but waiting a few more days won't hurt me. It also buys me some time.   


Smarter to reactivate the old claim until sure a new claim is the best route to go because:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Your decision to terminate a claim is final and cannot be changed.

 My credit is maxed, and rent is $1500 now. I will probably need to work at the hospital to fix this... I have been out of work for 5 months due to injured hands. I am almost healed enough to go back to work but the clinics I am working in are now closed (I do all the same stuff a physio does basically, I am an RMT). I think working at the hospital is the most natural continuation. I suspect they will be nice to me if I get sick for helping them and take good care of me probably as there will be no questions whether I am an asset. Edit: I am 25

I am self-employed. I fear the government will forget about contractual workers and give us nothing. They have given benefits to those in quarantine with the disease...great. What about all the rest of us? Isn't the point to keep non-sick people away from work, so that 'nobody has to worry about rent'? I hope something is coming, or people will just have to keep working and it defeats the whole purpose of social distancing ffs. They keep talking about buffing the hospitals, but so far they seem to be missing that they won't have to do that as much if they enable (pay) people to stay at home and REMOVE incentive to go out (close nightlife/bars/cafes/restaurants). I am sure they will not help us until they are really eager to cut the new case rates, and it will be too late then. They are probably hoping that many of us will be able to skate along without getting evicted for a few months with no income. So what, because I can't work from home I will be homeless then? I don't know what I expect from this government to fix that, if anything. They must understand that if people are evicted left and right, this is a way bigger issue all of a sudden, or so I hope...talk about an actual apocalypse.

Nervous personally about situations where this outbreak lasts longer than 4/5 months in Canada (it will, but seems like the spike of daily new cases could very well be in decline or at least plateau by then IMHO). The real miracle will be if 3mo from now we are in decline like China, but I have real suspicion that attempts to reduce hospital load will draw this whole thing out close to 2x longer as many will only delay their sickness by trying to evade the disease and isolating. I think it all depends how fast people change their behavior. It *seems* from other countries with fast reaction, once society gears itself towards preventing/isolating spread, the hospital load does go downwards and it's a better outcome for everyone. But if my clinics are closed for 4/5 months, I am fucked if I don't work at the hospital now aren't I...

 The future of Ontario What triggers this post I'm making right now is actually news out of the United States.  Three food sector retail workers have died of COVID-19.  With two grocery workers in the Toronto suburbs having tested positive today we can expect infection rates in the grocery supply chain to increase over the next month or two.  Apart from the potential tragedy of people dying of illness, each positive test requires a store closure and deep cleaning as well as self-isolation for other workers who might have been infected.  The cascade effect on the food supply chain is potentially significant.

In addition to that grocery workers have spoken out saying that being thanked doesn't do them much good when they're overworked for shitty pay.  Not all of them want to be working the long, hard hours they're working now, but they have little choice if they want to eat.  Apart from positive tests for COVID-19 you can expect burnout, workplace injuries, and other problems associated with a sector full of overworked and underpaid employees working in conditions in which maintaining good health and safety practices is a challenge.  Throw in bad-tempered frustrated customers and a postal incident is not out of the question despite the fact that most urban Ontarians don't have firearms.

All of which adds up to a return to labour organizing same as in the good old days of Tommy Douglas.  I'm not seeing the weak and corrupt Andrea Horwath or the self-indulgent existing large trade unions helping food sector workers organize to fight for better pay, humane working conditions, enforcement of proper health and safety practices, and other labour protections.  I'm also not seeing the traditional high-income high-status unionized sector, such as Toronto Teachers, lifting a finger to fight for the rights of essential grocery and transport workers, as those traditional unionized workers are more known for competing with non-unionized lower-paid workers to get ahead.  So at some point there will be a renewal of the labour movement from fresh grassroots rather than the complacent entitled high-paid existing unionized sector.  It will be full of conflict, the mainstream media will demonize it just as the old 1930s unions were demonized, people such as Toronto Teachers will complain about being personally inconvenienced by the new labour organizers, and good men and women working in grocery and food transport will lose their jobs, their families, and maybe everything they ever had.  It happened last time and it will happen again.

But I also feel that today's elected leaders will see the justice of what those low-wage essential workers are fighting for.  Sure, they will be hampered by today's high-income middle class of administrators, educators, software engineers, finance people, and assorted other sit-arounds-for-money, but those who lead will have their hearts in the right place and wil fight those self-interested high-income sectors as best they can without losing their support and therefore losing positions of leadership.  It'll be an interesting time for us observers, but I look forward to living through it and hope COVID-19 doesn't rob me of my popcorn opportunity.

 Question about relief measures for workers who are paid in cash I'm just wondering if there are any relief measures for the following situation:

Workers who are working illegally for cash in certain supermarkets who have been exposed to someone who tested positive (cough, roommate), may have mild symptoms and are hiding it, refuse to get tested because they won't qualify for relief money if ordered to isolate, have no savings, and continue to work because they desperately need money....

 Ethics, morals, and legal issues aside for the way they go about their lives, is their relief for them so that they can just stay home and not potentially spread?

Let me know and I'll be sure to spread this good info along...

 Applied for EI for now negated reason, how should I proceed? I've been employed part time for over a year and in early March I was offered a 72hr work week job with a different company from approx. March 25 to June 1. 

I informed my current employer of this new temporary opportunity and asked if I could take a leave of absence starting March 25. They agreed to the leave of absence but they started it and issued the ROE on March 10 instead of the 25th (with Leave of absence as the reason).

I didn't want to be without any income between the 10th-25th so I applied for EI using the ROE they filed and reason being leave of absence. I was expecting to only be without work for 2-3 weeks max. 

On March 16th I received an email from the other company saying the job has been delayed indefinitely due to COVID-19. I called my current employer on the 17th to let them know I no longer need the leave of absence and was told I should file for EI because they also have no work and I'm laid off now.

I applied for EI on March 13 but for a now nullified reason. I'm no longer on leave of absence but am laid off due to this virus. My application is still under review and it's been over 2 weeks.

I understand that EI applications before March 15 are not entitled to CERB but my actual layoff was put in place on March 17 and it was directly because of COVID-19.

Do I need to get a new ROE issued with "laid off" as the reason? Should I terminate my current application and make a new application? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

WHO has continuously mentioned ‚Äúsolidarity‚Äù as a key component in overcoming COVID-19, however I believe  WHO are not exposed to the realities of humanity and how cultural diversity can play a part. Thus, creating possible false hope, among WHO members, that as humans with agency we could contain the spread of COVID-19.

Tried calling the toll free number all i get is a busy-tone sound?. Been at it periodically every 15 mins for the last 3 hours. Im applying for ei sickness benefits due to being Quarantined. Please view description and link below for information: they are suppose to waive the 1 week waiting period. 

Off their page:
If you have already completed the application for EI sickness benefits whether you are sick or quarantined and would like to have the one-week waiting period waived, call the new toll-free phone number below. It is important to note that no other request will be actioned on this phone line. We will take action only for sick or quarantined clients affected by the COVID-19 for which the application for sickness benefits has been filed.

Telephone: 1-833-381-2725 (toll-free)



Still have to get my employers to submit an ROE if they already havent. I wont know until I get a Personal Access Code to My service canada since I didn‚Äôt have an account with them prior to this. If Anyone has begun receiving EI benefits due to quarantining or they are in same process please let me know and detail your experiences. Iv read directly from their website that payments dont start until about 28 days after you apply if you‚Äôre eligible and have submitted all required information. So if this telephone line starts to work then i will start getting paid in 21 days. So for the next 3 weeks Il have no income when this is the time its critical for most and if I finally get approved im lucky if I receive 55% of my weekly wages. This is the first time I applied for ei in my life I really hope that they approve compensation and backdate it for the 21 days you waited to hear back from them.

 Im canadian and my relief benefit just dropped by half, why? So I applied for EI on march 15th, before they announced CERB (the financial relief program). Apparently EI and CERB are run both run through the same government division and they decide what you receive. So the first month I got 1500, not the 2000 they promised even though I fit the requirements, I didn't worry too much its only a 500$ difference and I felt lucky I am receiving anything. Just today I got my second payment, 740$..... Not even enough to pay my rent, let alone food and utilities. I am wondering if anyone has any answers, or solutions for me. I cant get through on the phone lines as they are too busy and I have been searching online to no avail. Thanks in advance, I really hope someone can help me.

 Am I eligible for CERB? Hi all, 

Just wondering if anyone can provide some insight as to whether I am eligible for CERB. My situation is strange and I can't seem to find information to clarify whether I am eligible or not.. 

I worked for the summer season at a winery and was laid off in November 2019 due to the end of the season. I did not apply for EI as I was traveling to the USA for a few months to visit my partner. My plan was to travel over the winter and return to the winery at the end of April for another summer season. My return was never written in a contract agreement between my employer and I, however we had been emailing back and forth about my summer start date. 

Due to COVID the winery has of course closed until further notice meaning the work I have been expecting to come home to is no longer available and may not ever be available this year. 

I am currently still in the USA and planning on returning soon (there are still a few airports open with flights to canada for canadians) Long story short, my partner and I were sick for a few weeks and then we had family (who live with my partner) return from overseas and as a result we all had to quarantine for another 14 days. (Also I don't live in the usa / have dual citizenship, I am just on a visitors visa) 

Side note: I also am not sure if returning at the moment is a good idea despite the governments call to come home, I am safe at the moment in quarantine and have been in quarantine now for the required time to know that we are all covid free. Traveling at the moment would mean exposing myself in the airport and on the plane. I would have to isolate at my parents home upon return (they are over 60 so at higher risk). 

Any help would be greatly appreciated! 

Thank you!

 Can you receive EI or the relief fund if you're cut down from full time to part time hours? Trying to help my parents get themselves situated. My dad is laid off and getting the relief fund but my mom is being cut down to part time. (her work can't close because of a military contract even though they aren't doing any work for the contract right now) Can she qualify for any type of relief pay or EI, or does she have to make due with part time and hope for a lay off so she can get the relief fund? I tried looking on service Canada but couldn't get a clear answer.

 Alerted to potential exposure hi there - question for anyone w knowledge about the covid alert app.

yesterday evening I was notified by the app that I was exposed to someone w covid in the past 14 days. this was around 7ish. so i booked a covid test and then before i went to bed around midnight i checked my app again and it no longer said anything about exposure. instead there was a thumbs up and it said 'no exposure detected' or something. anyway, i got a test done this morning so ill know my results soon enough but i was curious to know if anyone else had experienced this? my first thought was that maybe that the notification was a mistake...

 I have access to high quality PPE Hey everyone! My name is Javier, I grew up in Spain but went to study in Canada and am now living and working in Vietnam. 

After seeing all the issues governments were having with importing Chinese PPE, I started looking into what Vietnam has to offer. 

For the past month and a half I have used my network here on the ground to find the most reliable sources for PPE. Right now I have access to: 

- Non Powder Nitrile gloves 
- 4-Ply Medical face masks
- medical gowns (level 1 and 2)

At this time, I can only supply for those looking for large quantities.

If anyone is interested, please send me a personal message I‚Äôm happy to provide my LinkedIn profile and more information.

 Covid Alert app stopped exposure checks. Still working? I was at a gathering with others who I know have the app so I was curious if my app did exposure checks. Zero.  It hasn't checked an exposure since August 8, even though it should be checking my husband's phone a few times a day.  My husband's app hasn't checked since August 5, and he's out at work near other people.  Is the app still working?

 Exposure checks in Google Settings of COVID Alert app I was flipping through my exposure checks and came across an exposure check from a couple weeks ago where I had 1 matched key. However I was never alerted as exposed through the app. 

Does this mean I was possibly near someone who later confirmed positive in the app but the exposure wasn't close enough to warrant an alert?

 Emergency care benefits, part time workers? Anybody have any idea how the emergency care benefit is going to work? 

Are part time workers such as students elligible? Is it going to be a fixed amount of money?
It's so weird because i just found myself a new job as a cashier to make ends meet during the crisis, also while being super unconfortable with working in a grocery store right now. I was laid off of my part time job temporarily.. It just sounds odd to me that i could suddenly get $2000 /month when it's more than what i would usually make as a part time worker.

Some of my friends were barely even working before the covid crisis and are saying they're going to apply and it just sounds unfair to me that they would get this money while i struggle to make ends meet in a grocery store? Idk.

Or do you think it's going to work like EI? Are students elligible to EI?

 A question I haven't seen answered about CERB vs EI My workplace is still open with a skeleton crew producing orders (manufacturing). Many employees were laid off in the last 2 weeks due to the pandemic. 

Now we are receiving some emergency orders and calling some people back to work, at least temporarily. 

With EI, I have a very good grasp on how working effects your payable amount. People can work, and it is advantageous for them to do so. 

With CERB, the eligibility is different. You must be without work for 14 consecutive days in a 4 week period. 

My question is, if these people come back to work for one week, will they now have to be unemployed for a further 2 weeks before being eligible to apply for CERB? That's the impression that I get. In that case, would they then move to regular EI benefits? Or nothing at all? 

Obviously these people applied for EI when they were laid off, not CERB, but they'll be moved to that program instead.

 RCMP Misconduct regarding an at-risk person for Covid-19 I am seeking help and any advice or links to help resolve a difficult situation that arose yesterday.   


&amp;#x200B;

My mother, who is 63 years old and immuno-compromised, is currently living with her sister and brother-in-law because her disability money doesn't cover enough of her monthly expenses to afford paying rent on her own. We are looking into other living options but for now, this is how things are. It's an uncomfortable situation for all three of them but they make the best of it and generally have a cordial relationship.  


&amp;#x200B;

As the Covid-19/quarantine situation continues, the isolation, anxiety and fear has been really hard on my mother as someone who suffers from a debilitating illness. She is terrified of catching the virus and has her ups and down emotionally. Yesterday morning she was having a particularly bad day and made a vaguely suicidal post on facebook. Some one then reported this post to the RCMP. The RCMP contacted my sister, explaining the situation and asking for the home address of my mother. She complied and gave them all the info they needed. The RCMP also contacted my mother directly and spoke with her over the phone, and they were insistent on meeting her in person to confirm she was ok. My mom explained that she was fine and that a meeting was not necessary, she was safe at home with her sister and brother-in-law. The police refused to accept this and showed up at their house. The RCMP demanded that my mom come with them to the hospital and for obvious reasons my mom refused. Going anywhere near a hospital right now is out of the question for her. Her sister also confirmed that due to my mom's illness it is a bad idea for her to be brought to the hospital, and that it was unnecessary.  The police then used force to handcuff my mother, put her in the cruiser, and bring her to the hospital. Her sister was there the whole time fighting for my mom, and telling the police that this was completely unnecessary.   


&amp;#x200B;

I drove to the hospital to meet my mom's sister and to make sure my mom was ok, because this is an extremely traumatizing situation and honestly just completely ridiculous. So because the RCMP deemed it appropriate to bring an immuno compromised 63 year old woman to a hospital with confirmed COVID-19 cases, they also were indirectly bringing 2 other people there (me and my aunt) and also putting our respective households at risk.  


&amp;#x200B;

My mom was deemed mentally sound and was dishcarged within 30 minutes. The doctor couldn't believe she had been brought in and we are all at a loss for how to proceed. I have filed a Access to Information request regarding all info on the case and we are submitting a formal complaint to the RCMP. I want to contact a lawyer but I'm unclear on what angle is best. Is this a human rights violation or what? I just don't understand how the police thought this was the most responsible course of action and how they thought cuffing an already sick and elderly woman and dragging her to the hospital was a good idea given the global pandemic. If she was actively suicidal and her life or someone near to her was at risk then I could understand, but the whole situation was so innocuous before the police arrived.  


&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the wall of text. Any help is appreciated at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

  
tl;dr my immuno compromised elderly mother was forcibly taken into a hospital with confirmed cases of covid-19 on very shaky ground and is now traumatized. we won't know if she has the virus for potentially 14 days and we are now all at risk.
