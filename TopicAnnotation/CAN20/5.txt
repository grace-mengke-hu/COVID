 CERB Eligibility Question I am still employed, but I stopped working on March 14th due to fear of Covid19. I got paid on March 26, and am if I am eligible for CERB? It says '14 days of no income' so should I wait exactly 2 weeks from the day I got paid to apply? Or should I apply on opening day?

 Employer making me work while on CERB So I haven't been paid for the last 4 weeks yet. The company simply doesnt have the money to pay me. They now want me to apply for cerb but keep working for them (at home). What they want me to do is whatever my take home salary is, the 2000 will cover a chunk of it. 

Is this legal? If not, what do I do?

 already receiving employment insurance Meanwhile, those who are already receiving employment insurance will continue to do so and be able to transition to the CERB if they’re unable to find work when their benefits run out due to the health emergency, according to the Department of Finance.

 Friendly reminder. Today the government gives itself a well deserved pay raise. As for the 51 million canadians who have not received a paycheck this month.

Only 6 more days until we can all try to use the website at the same time.

Fools.

 Covid 19 Employment related questions? I have been laid off from my job since October of 2019.  However, I have been able to pick up many shifts since I was laid off from October to March 15th when my place of employment shut down due to Coronavirus.  I have been reporting those earnings to EI and EI have been adjusting my payout.  My employer applied for and qualified for The CEWS and I have been receiving income from them.  I have just been reporting this income to EI as normal and they have been adjusting my EI payout.  Is this ok?  Am I going about this properly?

Would any or all of the combined earnings that an employee receives from the CEWS (75%) and my employer (25%) count towards Insurable earnings and/or Insurable Hours?

Being that the CEWS is retroactive to March 15th, would/should this than mean that any vacation or portion that has been used by my employer would/should be replaced since the subsidy is retroactive to March 15th?  Is the company not double dipping if they do not replace some or all of that?

The Baseline remuneration for Calculating CEWS

When calculating the wage subsidy, you will need to determine an employee's baseline remuneration. Baseline remuneration is considered to be the average weekly eligible remuneration paid to an employee during the period of January 1, 2020, to March 15, 2020. However, you may exclude from your calculation any period of seven or more consecutive days in respect of which the employee was not paid.

​My employer for some reason calculated my baseline renumeration on the average of 6 weeks prior to the shutdown even though I had NO periods of seven or more consecutive days in respect of which I was NOT paid.  Had they used the full period of January 1, 2020, to March 15, 2020 my baseline renumeration would have been more.

 CERB not received? I applied for CERB on Monday April 6th as I am born in March and have yet to receive it. I applied though service Canada though and not the CRA but I did enter my direct deposit information correctly. I have seen others receive theirs but there is a small group of people I know in the same boat as me and we are all wondering why we haven’t received ours when others had? Anyone have any insight for me?

 Shaw Cable Fail &gt;Hi,  
&gt;  
&gt;We continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely and we know that the threat posed by COVID-19 will result in some Shaw customers facing unexpected financial challenges. If you are having any concerns paying your monthly Shaw bill due to the COVID-19 situation, we will work with you to find a flexible payment arrangement that considers your financial and connectivity needs.  
&gt;  
&gt;As of Mar 28, 2020, we noticed there's an overdue balance on your account. Your total balance is $X. Should we not receive full payment on any outstanding balance on your account, it will be fully disconnected in 16 days. As Shaw does not offer payment extensions, you will need to make a payment for the full outstanding balance. But don’t worry, we’re here to help you avoid this potential service disruption. 

Can someone parse this for me because I surely must be smoking crack? Or, is whomever wrote this?

The first paragraph says that they will work with me to find a flexible payment arrangement that considers my needs.

Second paragraph gives ultimatum that X (paid in full) must be done by Y (16 days) or Z (cut off).

If my only option is that I "need to make a payment for the full outstanding balance" or else I will be "fully disconnected in 16 days" - where is the even *potential* for flexibility?

But "don't worry, you're here to help avoid this"? I'm terribly confused by this. 

It almost seems as if the first paragraph was injected on the top of their email template for billing issues; I could potentially understand that, except the last sentence of the second paragraph.

How about offering to retroactively decrease my bill to the current advertised price? Real messed up how adsense and the like always point Shaw ads at me, offering 600mbps for $65 when I'm paying \~$100.

Of course, I will be speaking with them; will see what happens, but I felt like this was a huge fail in public communications. If truly my only option, as it says, is to pay in full by that date then, I don't know, they could try this:

"We understand many customers may be facing challenges during this time and are willing to work out flexible payment arrangements where we can however accounts that are facing disconnection will need to be paid in full before the disconnection date."

At least that's honest, straight forward and professional. Saying you're willing to make a payment arrangement then immediately in the next paragraph lay out the terms of the only possibility is not only confusing but misleading.

Or maybe I'm just being over-senstive.

 Can you receive CERB and IE-ERB same time? I received a $2000 dollar cheque from CERB and a few days later received a direct deposit from EI-ERB of $3000 after doing a report. Is this allowed? If not, which amount would I need to pay back?
