 Reduced working hours increase density and community transmission Businesses including groceries are decreasing hours of service. But given a fixed amount of demand, this means that more people have to be present at the businesses, with longer queues. This increases the density of customers, and therefore community transmission. What is the reasoning for decreasing hours of service? If it is just to cut down employment costs, government intervention for some essential businesses such as groceries would reduce transmission.

 For all of you wondering why restaurants are still open, this is why. Use your head people. If you have been paying attention, even in the US restaurants that provide takeout are considered an essential service. The reason is pretty simple. There are lots of people who have to work  like police, nurses,Dr., Fire, Ambulance  truck drivers etc that need these services to stay open. They don't have the luxury of doing a 9-5 and then making a quick grocery store trip and relaxing at home. They are working 12+ hour days, coming home exhausted and then repeating the next day. They don't have the time to make a trip to the grocery store and prepare meals at home. They also don't need to expose themselves further by going to a grocery store filled with 100+ people. They limit their exposure by getting a take out meal that is handled by a handful of employees. There are thousands of essential workers in every city that need and rely on these services, The risk is a lot less having your food handled by a cook or two and then bagged, compared to hitting a grocery store filled with 100+ people with thousands of people touching items through the day by picking them up, touching carts, using pin pads, using cash, conveyor belts touchin shelving and food products.

&amp;#x200B;

The other reason is it relieves pressure from the grocery stores. That has been said numerous times by numerous officials. Every person buying fast food or takeout is relieving pressure from grocery stores which is an issue right now. Look at the lineups for drive thrus right now. Multiple that by hundreds of restaurants using drive thrus and thousands of restaurants doing take out only. Imagine all those people hitting the grocery stores instead.

&amp;#x200B;

Also why is every thread about Tim Hortons'? It's a mob mentality and its fuki\*ng stupid. Any restaurant that has drive thru is open. Any restaurant that did the majority of their business via takeout is open, if they are not they are an outlier.

 A vaccine by early as September? Oxford University has also mentioned September.

A question for anybody that knows the technology: Is this possible timeline nearly nonsense? I'm just a layman. I have no idea what's possible. People connected to the research go on tv and talk about it and the reporters/anchors are totally useless. The reporters seem to have zero knowledge and they certainly have zero skepticism. It seems to me that true journalism can't exist without skepticism. This article isn't any better than what I've heard on the news.

See the first paragraph...

&gt; [Pfizer begins human trials of possible coronavirus vaccine](
&gt; 
&gt; 2020/05/05
&gt;
&gt; Pfizer and the German pharmaceutical company BioNTech announced that their potential coronavirus vaccine began human trials in the United States on Monday. If the tests are successful, the vaccine could be ready for emergency use here as early as September.
&gt; 
&gt; The two firms are jointly developing a vaccine candidate based on genetic material known as messenger RNA, which carries the instructions for cells to make proteins. By injecting a specially designed messenger RNA into the body, the vaccine could potentially tell cells how to make the spike protein of the coronavirus without actually making a person sick.
&gt; 
&gt; Because the virus typically uses this protein as a key to unlock and take over lung cells, the vaccine could train a healthy immune system to produce antibodies to fight off an infection. The technology also has the advantage of being faster to produce, and tends to be more stable than traditional vaccines, which use weakened virus strains.
&gt; 
&gt; Moderna, Inovio, CanSino and several other pharmaceutical companies are trying similar approaches, some of which began the first phase of tests in humans a few weeks ago. But no vaccine made with this technology for other viruses has ever reached the global market.
&gt; 
&gt; Pfizer, which is based in New York, and BioNTech injected the first human volunteers with their vaccine candidate, called BNT162, in Germany last month. The experimental shot was given to just 12 healthy adults, although the trial will eventually expand to 200 participants.
&gt; 
&gt; In the United States, the drug companies plan to test the vaccine on 360 healthy volunteers for the first stage of the study, adding up to 8,000 volunteers by the end of the second stage. The study will be conducted at New York University's Grossman School of Medicine, the University of Maryland School of Medicine, the University of Rochester Medical Center and the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center.
&gt; 
&gt; Participants will be divided into groups to compare four variations of the vaccine, each representing a format of messenger RNA with instructions to make a distinct piece of the spike protein machinery. Doctors will closely monitor the participants' antibody levels, liver enzymes and other indicators of possible side effects.
&gt; 
&gt; "Vaccines are given to healthy people to keep them healthy, so they have to be very, very safe," said Dr. Mark Mulligan, an infectious disease specialist at N.Y.U.
&gt; 
&gt; Testing multiple candidates in parallel is one way the companies hope to compress the amount of time it takes to gather enough proof to apply for emergency-use approval by the Food and Drug Administration. Once that approval is received, Pfizer and BioNTech could distribute the first few million doses here.
&gt; 
&gt; As soon as pharmaceutical companies can show evidence that a vaccine is effective and has produced no serious harms, they can apply for this kind of approval, which allows doctors to administer the vaccine to those most in need. But more detailed study results may still be needed to persuade federal regulators to approve a candidate for the broader public.
&gt; 
&gt; Given the need to quash the coronavirus, vaccine makers around the world are racing to speed up their timelines for development, a process that typically takes years. But companies are making extraordinary efforts to stagger trials and, in some cases, skip essential steps, such as animal testing.
&gt; 
&gt; Some experts have warned that expecting an approved vaccine within 18 months — as Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading expert on infectious diseases, has suggested — is overly optimistic.
&gt; 
&gt; A group of scientists developing a vaccine at Oxford University in England say that even 18 months is too long to wait for a vaccine. With emergency approval, they say they are aiming to have the first few million doses of their vaccine available in September.
&gt; 
&gt; Pfizer and BioNTech say they hope to have several million doses by then, too, if everything goes well with these human trials.
&gt; 
&gt; "We need to think differently, we need to think faster," said Dr. Mikael Dolsten, Pfizer's chief scientific officer. "If we get hit with a second wave of coronavirus infections in October at the same time as the flu, things will be much worse than what we've already experienced."

 Email from Air Canada 
The airline industry has always been a fast‑changing one and these times are no different. It’s important that we be nimble and respond quickly and effectively to developments around the world while maintaining our commitment to serving you safely and reliably.

Like all of you, we’ve been monitoring the evolving global impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID‑19) and are in constant dialogue with Canadian and international health authorities. At Air Canada our core value is Safety First, Always ‑ for our customers and for our employees. So I’d like to share what we have been doing in our operation to uphold that commitment.


At the airport: To promote a more hygienic airport experience, we have placed hand sanitizers in key areas such as check‑in counters, gates and lounges. We also have constant reminders about the importance of hand washing.


Before a flight: If a customer who appears unwell attempts to check‑in or board an aircraft, our agents will make inquiries of the customer in regard to their health. This can include consultation with our own Medical Desk and/or a third‑party health provider. If they are unfit to travel, they will not be permitted to board.


In the air: Our aircraft are equipped with High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters which effectively capture 99.9% of particulate from recirculated air in the aircraft cabin. This includes microbial organisms such as bacteria and viruses. These filters are similar to those used in hospital rooms and like those in hospital rooms, they refresh the cabin air every 2 to 3 minutes.


After every flight: Coronaviruses are easily eliminated by routine surface cleaning and sanitization. Air Canada uses cleaning products, including hospital‑grade disinfectants which have a wide-spectrum microbial activity and are proven effective against human coronavirus.

 Travelled abroad but you’re an essential worker? You still have to report for duty until you show symptoms of Covid-19 I received this email today....  if my family isn’t sick yet, I’m sure we will be soon. 

Dear,

The Police Association continues to meet daily with the Police Service regarding the COVID-19 outbreak.  Our mandate is and always will be to ensure the safety and well-being of our members and their families.  This situation continues to evolve quickly and the information I'm providing today, may change tomorrow.  

We want to thank the members currently out of the country that reached out letting us know their whereabouts.  It's critically important we know where our members are so we can assess their potential risk of being exposed to COVID-19. 

At present, the Chief has directed that all members travelling and at home should follow the flow chart found posted around the station. The Chief has consulted President — as well as the Senior Leadership team and at this time is not implementing a mandatory 14 day self-isolation period for members returning from abroad.  The flow chart outlines steps that should be taken to self-monitor for symptoms.  

The Chief Medical Officer for —— has issued recommendations for "essential workers".  Everyone employed by the Police Service has been deemed to fit into this category.  As such we are using the flow chart in accordance with these guidelines.
 
If someone returned from out of country and is symptom free, they can return to work if they are an essential worker at their place of employment. If they go on to develop symptoms they stay home from work and begin their self-isolation. 
If a family returned from out of country and no one has symptoms, the children are required to self isolate for 14 days however the parents don’t have to. 
If anyone returns from out of country and they have symptoms that are consistent with Covid-19 they are to self isolate for 14 days

The police service has a plan in place for the issuance of Personal Protective Equipment for officers as well as keeping the front desk open.

 PSA: Criminally Irresponsible Company Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

I   am writing this with the intention of getting advice for my next  steps,  and letting the public know about what is happening at my  workplace,  and how it will affect them.

&amp;#x200B;

I   work at a large commercial moving company based in Toronto.  They have  no intention of  shutting down.  Technically, it has been deemed an  essential business  (transportation), but 90% of businesses also seem to  be essential in  Ontario.  I don't think society will crumble if some  big company can't  move their headquarters from one high rise to  another.  Do you?

&amp;#x200B;

They   have put in place no policies to protect the movers.  There is no PTO.    People are scared of calling in sick lest they receive a cut in  hours.   Full-time workers have no benefits.  We don't receive hazard  pay.  We  don't even get overtime.  There has been no change in policy  to protect  workers.  Nothing.  Well, they did give us nitrile gloves  and a big  bottle of hand sanitizer at the dispatch.

&amp;#x200B;

Now how does this affect you?

&amp;#x200B;

On   a busy day we have around 50 people working.  Those 50 people will   interact face to face among each other throughout the week.  Including   those 50 initial movers, our company also has around 30-40 office   workers, 10 warehouse workers, and a plethora of third party truck   drivers coming in and out and in and out.  Some of these third party   truck drivers are also making deliveries to New York state (20,000 cases   at time of writing).

&amp;#x200B;

Back   to those 50 initial movers now.  We touch random surfaces all day, we   interact with clients, we make deliveries all over southern Ontario.    Imagine if one person at this company was sick.  Imagine how many people   would become infected in a matter of two weeks.  These movers are   people who go to your grocery stores, live in your communities, they   might even be in your social bubble.  If not the movers then someone   they've interacted with.

&amp;#x200B;

Regardless   of all of this, the owner and upper management has been fighting tooth   and nail to stay open, and to take on as many jobs as possible.  And  for  what?  Money.  We are humans, not a pieces of meat.

&amp;#x200B;

This   company is literally risking public health and safety.  The owner   doesn't care about us.  The management doesn't care about us.  People   will get sick, and God forbid die from the actions (or inaction) of the   upper echelon of this company.

&amp;#x200B;

I am very reluctant to share anymore information, but if I can initiate a meaningful course of action I will gladly share more.

&amp;#x200B;

What can I do for now?  Any advice?

* Près des deux cinquièmes (36,5 %) des entreprises ont mis à pied au moins un employé depuis le début de la pandémie.
* Près des trois quarts (74,1 %) des entreprises s’attendaient à ce que leur nombre d’employés reste le même au cours des trois prochains mois.
* Près du tiers (30,8 %) des entreprises ont indiqué que leurs revenus étaient en baisse de 30 % ou plus en août 2020 par rapport à août 2019.

 Home renovation can reopen? I see ontario will reopen essential businesses soon. Does home renovations apply? And I also see quebec opening up some businesses soon as well. Because I live in Ottawa, I want a company in Gatineau to do some In home Renos in my rental unit. And I also have another company in Ottawa to do other part of Reno’s in the home.

 So glad (but still sad) to see that all non-essential businesses in Ontario must close tomorrow by 11:59pm. I am wondering.... is there a list of non-essential businesses? What constitutes "non-essential"? This was the right thing to do.  Yes, its bad for the economy, but that too can be fixed in the future and this WILL save lives.

What is non-essential?  Are there any grey areas to this?  I am amazed that at this moment there are still record stores, clothing stores, shoe stores and other retailers open.  But all that changes tomorrow night.  Thank God.

 Folks with kids in paid daycare or private school- how are you addressing the issue of 'refunds'? I'm in Ontario and we have a 4 year old in preschool to the tune of $1500/month.

At this stage I think it's pretty clear that no provinces are going to re-open schools or daycares this year.  

Has anyone received a communication or plan from their school/daycare regarding payments ie. refund or tution credit etc?

My kid's school is convinced that everything will re-open in Ontario on April 6th and quite frankly I think they're nuts.

I'm a bit peeved as we prepaid the school year up front so they already have the money.

 Two questions I know it's really tough to answer my first question but I'm just looking for some general opinions I guess. How long will it take to see if the social distancing etc will flatten the Curve? I don't mind doing it at all but I'm just wondering when will start seeing some results for our efforts.

My second question is: is there a difference between Clorox disinfecting wipes and Lysol disinfecting wipes? I always assumed they were pretty much the same products. But I keep seeing recommendations to get Clorox wipes. Thanks

 SCHOOL SUSPENDED INDEFINITELY Alberta and Saskatchewan recently suspended schools indefinitely for the rest of the remaining 2019-2020 school year which sucks. We’ve got a bunch of gr 12s in my school having a break down and being really depressed since everything’s cancelled especially their graduation ceremony. They still do graduate but it’s just heartbreaking to see them go to school for years and right when they’re so close to finishing high school they can’t even have the ceremony they’ve been dreaming about. 

I know the suspension is for all of the safety and well-being of everyone. It’s just really disappointing how the start of the year turned out for everyone.

When did italy lockdown and how far away from that are we?
