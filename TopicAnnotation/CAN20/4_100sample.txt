 A death is classified as not known to be confirmed or probable COVID-19if t  he decedent died in New York City (NYC resident or residency pending) had no known positive laboratory test for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) and the death certificate does not list COVID-19 or an equivalent as a cause of death.   


 A death is classified as probable if the decedent was a New York City resident (NYC resident or residency pending) who had no known positive laboratory test for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) but the death certificate lists as a cause of death “COVID-19” or an equivalent.

 Why does COVID-19 seem so much more lethal in Canada?  I am an Ottawa, Ontario, Canada native who currently lives in El Paso, Texas, USA. I have noticed that COVID-19 seems far more lethal in Ottawa than in El Paso.

Ottawa has had 2629 cases and 264 deaths, for a mortality rate of about 10%. El Paso has far more cases, at 16,308, but we have had only 29 more deaths than Ottawa. El Paso has 293 deaths for a mortality rate of about 1.8%

If infected, you are approximately 5 times more likely to die of COVID-19 in Ottawa than in El Paso. The statistics State and Province-wide differ as well. Texas has a mortality rate of about 1.7% and Ontario's death rate is about 7%.

Nation-wide, Canada's death rate from COVID is about 7.5% and the USA's is less than 0.5%

There are far more cases here in the USA, but the lethality is much lower. Did Canada get hit with a much more lethal strain? Is the difference due to health care standards? Is Canada not actively testing? Why is COVID-19 so much more deadly in Canada?

If we assume *30-70% rate of population infection, 1-3% death rate, and \~38 million* Canadians it breaks down as follows;

If the population infection rate is 30% of 38 million Canadians, 11.4 million people will be infected. If death rate is at 1%, that is 114,000 Canadians dead.

If the population infection rate is 70% of 38 million Canadians, 26.6 million people will be infected. If death rate is at 3%, this is 798,000 Canadians dead.

 We created a COVID-19 antibody test interpreter  Dear r/CanadaCoronavirus,

I’m sure a lot of you have seen all of the news articles recently about how COVID-19 antibody testing doesn’t actually tell you much even if they claim to be very accurate. Well, we have decided to create a [site]( that helps anyone interpret their results in a more meaningful way. All you have to do is enter a couple of statistics from the specific test you took and you will instantly be able to see what your test results really mean.

We also try to give a more intuitive explanation for the incredibly unintuitive results which arise out of COVID-19 antibody tests.

If you have taken an antibody test or just want to learn a bit more on what testing accuracy really means, please check out [our site]( and let us know what you think.

Thanks, [the Covid Test Interpreter Team]( (CTIT)

 Covid19 can live for few hours in the air? So news articles say covid19 can live in the air for a few hours after being released through cough or sneezing from an infected person. And if he does release it and we inhale it, we can be infected as well. But what if the infected person just breathes in and out normally. And we breathe the same air as the infected person. Can we be infected as well? Or is it only if released by sneezing or coughing?

 Childrens' COVID severe outcome tracking in Canada I understand that this is not a very positive topic but I wanted to create this thread as there are some worrying trends in the data that point to more cases than we know about.

Firstly, there are sporadic reports of MIS-C and there doesn't seem to be anyone tracking these cases.

Secondly, the deaths are not being reported officially in a timely manner.  We know one death occurred in August a [19 year old in Quebec]( however, that death is not reflected in the official numbers.  Data from [ shows an additional 2-3 deaths in Quebec in 2-17 year olds from April/May posted in the past week and 1 MIS-C case in Alberta.  Ontario has a report of a child who died [with COVID but not of COVID](  There have been reports of children drowning in the bathtub from febrile seizures in the US with diagnosed/undiagnosed COVID.  There is also [an official death in a child with COVID in Ontario]( the only death in the National system and the report goes to great lengths to ensure all we know is the child was under 10.

With all this data, there could be 4-6 deaths in children under 20 in Canada with close to 11,000 positive tests.

The public needs to know what the real story is here so if anyone has any further insight or links to articles, please post it.

 What are the chances of getting COVID at a Covid Testing Center? Hello everyone,

I booked some time at a COVID testing center (the Centenary one) as I had a stuffy nose, felt hot on Friday and had a stuffy nose on Saturday until now. The doctor told me to take a COVID test as precaution, and my dad went to the hospital yesterday for an MRI so I am taking one in case I test positive. I am worried about catching COVID from the Covid testing center, I am planning to wear an N100 mask and a surgical mask over it - along with goggles, is that good enough for safety precautions?

I feel better now but my mom says I am worrying too much. Should I take the test regardless?

This means calculating the death rate in closed cases is more accurate (which would be 18% from [
