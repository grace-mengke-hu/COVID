 CERB + Tax Return Okay I have a question so I did my taxes a couple days  (could be a week) ago before I knew I wouldnâ€™t be able to work anymore due to high exposure ...Iâ€™m currently not working because I have moderate-severe asthma and my workplace refused to lay me off so I had to leave and Iâ€™ve applied for CERB because I couldnâ€™t get e.i . However whenever my taxes come back does that count as income? Because I know weâ€™re not supposed to have any income from working but itâ€™s a tax return? 
Can anyone answer pleaseeeeeeeðŸ˜­

 Question about the CERB Quick question about the CERB. Weâ€™re a family of seven, both my parents are self employed. Myself, one of my brothers, and one my sisters are university students, working part-time hours each to help with bills. 
 
All 5 of us have made over 5,000$ in 2019. Also, all 5 of us are out of work for the foreseeable future. My parents are driving instructors, my brother and sister work at day cares, and Iâ€™m a server. Are all 5 of us eligible for the CERB? 
 
Is the benefit up to 2000$ a month depending on criteria? Or is it a straight 2000$ a month for four months? 
 
So far the only criteria Iâ€™ve been able to find is a minimum income of 5,000$ in 2019 and being above the age of 15. 
 
Any help would be appreciated... stay safe people!
