 Public service workers, if not everyone in the public, should be wearing simple homemade facemasks. This will probably get taken down but at least I tried. 

I know medical experts in Canada and the US have said that healthy people should not be wearing masks and that we should reserve masks for medical people. I agree with that - ALL ACTUAL MEDICAL MASKS SHOULD BE RESERVED FOR HOSPITALS AND MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS. 

However, I believe that public service workers should start adopting wearing basic homemade cloth facemasks or non-medical grade facemasks in public. Basic cloth facemasks are still considered as a last resort for medical professionals if they are stuck with nothing else to use. 

According to the CDC: [In settings where facemasks are not available, HCP might use homemade masks \(e.g., bandana, scarf\) for care of patients with COVID-19 as a last resort.]( ... and yes they do qualify that by saying that a face-shield should be used as well, but it does show that even any kind of mask is useful instead of none. 

Here are a few criticisms by prominent medical professionals on why we should start wearing masks in the US and in Canada: 

  



I think the biggest thing that wearing a face mask does is it is a psychological tool. 

- It reminds the wearer not to touch their face or touch it less often. 
- It distances us from each other because when you see someone with a mask you feel cautious. 
- It reminds everyone that there is an infectious disease spreading everywhere 
- It reminds us that there is a worldwide pandemic happening 

Wearing a mask is also important from the point of view that no one knows who is infected until it is too late. There are also asymptomatic carriers who will never know they had the virus but end up passing on to others. Does it make any sense to allow public service workers to be constantly and daily exposed if we don't know how many people they may come into contact with that may or may not have the virus? 

People are resistant to wearing a mask in Canada and the US because we are not used to it. We associate it to the end of the world and that something terrible has happened. If we all start wearing them now, it will feel panicky for a short while but after a week or so, we will normalize it and it will just be another part of living in a pandemic. In the long run, it will add to the efforts we are doing to 'flatten the curve' or 'plank the curve'. 

Businesses are resistant to seeing people, especially their employees, wearing masks - not from a medical or preventative point of view but from an image point of view. No big company wants their employees in their fancy modern restaurants, coffee shops, grocery stores or store fronts wearing masks. Many employees are reporting that they are discouraged from wearing masks because it will 'scare the customers away'. What business doesn't understand is that at one point, when more and more people are wearing masks, those people will start to avoid places where workers are not wearing masks because they will start to be seen as places where infection control is not taken seriously. 

It is also so very wrong to tell public workers to not wear masks because you want to maintain your company image at the expense of putting your workers at risk. This is going to be weeks if not months or over a year of infection control, quarantining and isolation so we have to do everything we can to protect ourselves, especially our public front line workers who are exposed every single day. 

**To all you workers out there,** you will have to take action yourselves because your government and business owners won't do it for you until they absolutely have to. Wear a mask, protect yourselves and take the initiative because everyone else will wait until enough of you get sick or die before doing anything about it.

 If everyone wears facemasks, that would help right? Since face masks prevent you from spreading germs to other people, then if everyone wore a face mask (even if asymptomatic) we wouldn't have as many issues with spreading the disease right?

So why doesn't everyone wear one even if it's just made out of cloth? I'm so mad that the government was like we shouldn't wear them and stuff.

 Hospital: "Remove your mask or do not enter." As of April 6th, hospitals in Alberta, Canada **refuse entry unless you remove your own mask.** They will supply a basic surgical mask, which offers less protection than an N95. There are no exceptions if your are elderly, high risk, a healthcare worker, wear their mask on top of yours, or bring a new mask in the package and open it in hospital. It's their mask or no mask.

The fallowing was sent to me from a hospital supervisor, copy/pasted from an alleged memo by the senior practice lead and physician of infection prevention and control in the Calgary zone.

&gt;With regards to individuals at triage screening:  
&gt;  
&gt;o **If they screen ILI positive**: they should be asked to clean their hands and given a new mask and asked to wear it unless instructed by a healthcare provider to remove it during their stay. They should be asked to remove their gloves and clean their hands.  
&gt;  
&gt;o **If they screen ILI negative:** but want to wear the mask/gloves out of concern from what they have seen on the media, they should be  asked to remove their home mask, and  gloves and clean their hands and give them a hospital mask, to wear for their stay, and they should not wear gloves but clean their hands when entering and exiting the hospital/ unit if they are coming to visit an existing patient.  
&gt;  
&gt;o **If a member of the public comes in wearing a cloth mask, respirator, other mask ppe device, or even a hospital grade mask:** they should be asked to remove their mask and clean their hands and be given a hospital grade mask to wear in place of their own mask while in the facility.  
&gt;  
&gt;o **If any member of the public or staff comes in wearing gloves:** they should be asked to remove their gloves and clean their hands. They should be asked to not wear gloves while in the facility, the only exception may be in instances where the individual has draining wounds or other challenges when they cannot cover their hands with a dressing or where they cannot contain the drainage, then gloves may be valuable in assisting in containing drainage.

Is this right, or is this putting more healthcare workers and vulnerable people at higher risk?

 Homemade masks I see a sewing pattern going around that claims to be 70% as effective as an N95 mask and was apparently made by a designer working with UofT. 

Does it make sense to start making these and donate to long term care homes? Or is that just making things worse. How do I know if these claims are true? 

Also seeing some people 3d printing n95 masks with a removable filter - how effective are those?

 It has been PROVEN that masks are INEFFECTIVE against COVID-19. This can be demonstrated by vaping while wearing a surgical, cotton/cloth, sponge or N-95 mask. 



The aerosols produced by an e-cigarette (or “vape”) have a size of approximately 120-165 nanometers. The aerosols in the exhaled vape easily exit the mask VISIBLY between the point of contact of the face and the mask. In some masks, the aerosols even go THROUGH the front of the mask.  Consequently, the viral particles also pass around/through the mask; a COVID-19 viral particle is approximately 60-140 nanometers in diameter, which is even smaller than aerosol particles, on average. It is therefore pointless to wear a mask unless you plan on sneezing/coughing in someone’s face because it only blocks large droplets effectively (but your elbow can do this for you) If you walk down the same aisle as someone else in a grocery store or go anywhere remotely near the place they walked (while both wearing masks and keeping a 2-meter distance), you are still very likely to inhale viral particles as they remain in the air for ~ 3 HOURS. 

Let me know why you think I’m wrong, if you disagree.

 Petition for Mandatory Masks in Saskatchewan I hope it's ok to post this here.  To me, wearing masks seems like such an obvious, simple way to lower the risk of transmission of Covid-19.  [It's what Health Canada recommends.](  I've been thrilled to hear about other countries, states, provinces and cities mandating masks in public indoor spaces.  But here in SK, that isn't happening.

We've had a brutal couple of days in terms of our numbers.  [Our number of known active cases have increased by 400% in less than 2 weeks.](  I'm not trying to sound alarmist, but it sounds like community spread is on the rise in Saskatchewan and things are going to get worse before they get better.  And yet masks have not been mandated.

Some people are diligently wearing their masks, but most people aren't.  People are blatantly ignoring the arrows in stores and are failing to physically distance - I've experienced it firsthand.  Some people are ignorant, some are oblivious and some are unwilling to subject themselves to a little inconvenience and discomfort to save lives.  Some just plain don't care.  Hell, my neighbor spews bullshit conspiracy theories about Bill Gates every chance he gets and has actively tried to talk my spouse and me out of wearing masks.  Because it's "not as bad" here as in other places or no one they personally know has caught it, a lot of people seem to think Covid-19 isn't a threat.

**Bottom line: most people here aren't going to wear masks unless they're forced to.**

The Saskatchewan Nurse's Union [has been begging for a mask mandate](  The Saskatchwan Medical Association [is calling on people to wear masks]( Countless people who work with the public wish masks were mandatory.

I decided to start a petition.  My hope is I can take it to decision makers in this province and use it to apply a little more pressure to them to mandate masks.  Maybe it will help or maybe it won't, but I have to try.  I'm hoping to reach 1,000 signatures, but I'll be contacting those in charge on Monday regardless as I don't want to wait too long.

**If you live in SK and care about reducing our number of active cases...**

**If you don't want people from SK spreading Covid-19 to your area when they travel...**

**If you care about sparing other human beings from preventable illness and death...**

**Please sign and consider sharing on social media.**

Thank you and stay safe!

 Shopping at T&amp;T with mandatory masking policy Last night I shopped at the T&amp;T grocery store in Waterloo. If you aren't familiar with T&amp;T they are a Chinese grocery chain with stores across Canada and they have a mandatory masking policy. 

To enter the store, you had to have on a mask, submit to a temperature check and sanitize your hands. It was not optional. Outside the store in the lineup to get in, two people did not have masks and they were informed they had to have on a mask. The male started to complain but the female with him told to be quiet and went to their car and got masks for them both. Surgical masks were available for sale for $1.00 at the door. 

Inside the store, everybody was wearing their masks properly. I saw nobody pulling down their masks to talk and I saw no noses sticking out of masks. Social distancing was maintained as much as possible. The aisles were narrow but people were not crowding and were passing each other as quickly as reasonable. 

Most of the customers were Asian so I think that they have much better awareness of proper masking than Westerners. My takeaway is that the with proper education people will wear masks properly. They don't get reckless and disregard social distancing.

I felt very safe shopping there. I didn't have to worry about somebody sneezing in their hand in the parking lot and handling the produce. I didn't have to worry about somebody coughing or sneezing and leaving a cloud of viral particles hanging in the air inside the store. I didn't have to worry when people accidentally or unavoidably got too close.

I am an advocate of masking and what I saw last night convinces me that a sane, well thought out masking policy can be easily implemented and presents no serious difficulties for adherence.

 Why do people hate the mask so damn much? Why do people hate on wearing a mask so much? I mean, I know that masks are supposedly not all that useful. But i feel like it's better than nothing. We also don't know all that much about the virus so maybe it does help a little bit. Do you think maybe we were told the mask is useless to stop people from panicking during this mask shortage?

And why do people hate and judge others who decide to wear a mask? So what if the mask is completely useless, if it gives people wearing it a sense of security, what's the matter? Why do people judge and stare? Like, let people do whatever the fuxk they want.

 If wearing a mask during a pandemic is a matter of "freedom" or choice, then drunk driving would also be Drunk driving is not allowed because it is not about you, it is about protecting everyone. Mask wearing during a pandemic should also be treated the same, no?

 Surgical Masks for general citizens I don't have a sewing kit, elastics, or sewing kit.

I'll wear something on my next trip out for my biweekly groceries but I have to ask.



Where can we buy masks and not take from healthcare workers?


I see the tides changing and now all of a sudden the government is pretending like they've told us masks have always been important and we're stupid for not wearing them.


Does anyone have any links for surgical masks or even homemade? I don't want to be barred by a grocery store when this policy knee jerk switches.
