 Looking for that site that gave all the cases and their location and history I can't find it but there was a site that gave every single case and it's location. Anybody know what it was?

 Canada had a 35% increase in cases from mar 15 (253 cases) to mar 16 (341 cases).

 Nova Scotia's current number of cases drops for the first time [

To date, **19,032 test results have been reported** in Nova Scotia, or 1.95% of the entire population, or about 1 out of every 50 people. Today marks the first day our current cases went down. 

Out of those tests:

* **18,453** results were **negative** (97% of all tests) and **579** results were positive (3% of all results)
* There are **400** **current cases** (2.1% of all tests), **389** of which are being treated at home
* **11** are currently **hospitalized** across the province (2.75% of all current positive cases)
   * The number of hospitalizations has been stable for the last 12 days despite the number of tests and cases dramatically increasing, ranging from 9-11 admissions,  with no more than 5 cases admitted to ICU units on a given date.
* **176** have **recovered** (30.4% of all positive tests)
* **3** people have **died**: a woman in her 70s and a woman in her 90s, both from Cape Breton and both with underlying medical conditions, and a man in his 80s from HRM.
* Since our state of emergency was declared, an average of **2.8% of all daily tests** performed have come back **positive**

It is *incredible* to see the change in numbers from my update from the start of the month: [

 Canada's "Have Provinces" and "Have not Provinces" of COVID-19 **The "Have Provinces":**

[Nova Scotia]( Active Cases, Hospitalization, ICU admissions slightly off peak. New cases trending up, but flattening. 1.02 in 100,000 hospitalized. Mortality per 100,000 population: 1.23 

[Alberta]( Active Cases, Hospitalization, ICU admissions at peak. New cases trending up steeper than they did in March. 1.59 in 100,000 hospitalized. Mortality per 100,000 population: 1.5

[Ontario]( Active Cases, Hospitalization at peak. New cases trending up after slowing, but shallower than they did in March. 5.97 in 100,000 hospitalized. Mortality per 100,000 population: 4.48 

[Quebec]( Active Cases, Hospitalization at peak. New cases trending up after flattening, but shallower than they did in March. 14.97 in 100,000 hospitalized. Mortality per 100,000 population: 13.28. The situation is by far the worst in Canada.

**The "Have not Provinces":**

[Saskatchewan](  Active Cases, Hospitalization, ICU admissions are all 14 days or more from peak. New cases are flat at just above 3 cases a day. 0.42 in 100,000 hospitalized. Mortality per 100,000 population: 0.34

[Manitoba]( Active Cases, Hospitalization, ICU admissions are all 14 days or more from peak. New cases are flat at just above 1 case a day. 0.51 in 100,000 hospitalized. Mortality per 100,000 population: 0.44

[Newfoundland &amp; Labrador]( Active Cases, Hospitalization, ICU admissions are all 14 days or more from peak. New cases are flat at just above 1 case a day. Had 5 straight days of zero cases. 1.15 in 100,000 hospitalized. Mortality per 100,000 population: 0.58

[New Brunswick]( Active Cases, Hospitalization, ICU admissions are all 14 days or more from peak. New cases are flat and at zero. Had only 1 new case in the last 7 days. 0.64 in 100,000 hospitalized. No deaths. The situation is clearly the best in Canada.

**The odd one out:**

[British Columbia](  Active Cases are back at peak recently after going 14 days off peak. Hospitalization, ICU admissions are all 14 days or more from peak. The 7 days moving average for new cases is flat and off the peak. It is levelled at roughly 33 new cases a day,  comparably higher than the "Have not Provinces" but is not trending up as the "Have Provinces". 2.2 in 100,000 hospitalized. Mortality per 100,000 population: 1.76. Both statistics are higher than some of the "Have Provinces".
