 Studies on how easily the virus is transmitted? This might not be allowed here, I'm not sure where else to put it.  


My current situation is that I live with my best friend, who is an ICU nurse in Victoria, BC. We are being very careful, having groceries delivered and all the hand washing.   
I'm having a hard time convincing my boyfriend, who lives in town too that it's not ok for him to come and live here for a while, lovely as that would be.  


He and his roommate have also been really careful and only go out for occasional runs and walks.  


He just doesn't buy that there is a risk when we have both been isolating for at least a month now. I've tried to explain so many times that there is still a risk from the incoming groceries and from passing people outside.   


My roommate is looking after non-COVID patients in the ICU and is understandably pretty worried about taking it there. He seems to think she is being overly paranoid. I'm hesitant to ask her to talk to him as I fear they would just end up arguing.   


I'm wondering if anyone has seen any studies on how easily the virus is transmitted? Or any other advice. He's a rational person and I think he's just really missing me.

 Domestic Travel (Ontario) Hi everybody, I'm looking for some information as to whether or not I should be traveling within Ontario this weekend. My girlfriend and I (from Toronto) were planning on visiting my parents in a so far unaffected area of Ontario, but are reconsidering given the confirmation of community spread. My parents are both in their late 50s and one of them has a weakened immune system due to a chronic condition. 

Am I being paranoid or should we be staying away?

 Nova Scotia Update: A flattened curve and expanded testing Since  [my last update]( we said goodbye too early to another brave Nova Scotian, Captain Jenn Casey who was killed in the Snowbird crash on May 17th. She left a lot of light in this world and will be remembered with so much love. 

It's **day 64** of our provincial State of Emergency, and **76 days** since our legislative assembly met for question period. 

We have 10 full weeks of data for reported cases in Nova Scotia, and over the last 5 weeks **our** **weekly recoveries have outpaced our weekly diagnoses**. 

The current raw numbers are available at [novascotia.ca/coronavirus]( but here are some highlights and other noteworthy points:

***Infections.*** As of today:

* There are **19 active cases** in our province, **12** are **long-term care** **residents** at Northwood Group's Halifax location, and **6 are hospitalized** (3 in ICU), leaving just one known case "in the community" and hopefully quarantined at home.
* **39 105** test results have been reported. That's the equivalent of about 1 out of every 25 Nova Scotians (4%) getting tested, though I'm still a bit unclear if those results include re-tests. 
* Roughly **2.7%** of all tests have come back **positive.** 
* **974** of our 1051 known cases (**92.5%**) have officially **recovered**.  
* **58 people have died**, with 52 of those happening at Northwood. The crude death rate is around 5.6% (as defined as known deaths/known outcomes).
* May has seen fewer **than 1% of daily test results come back positive**, on average. 
* **The majority of cases (52%) have been in people aged 20 to 59 years old.** 
   * That said, **40%** **are** **60+ years old**, even though this demographic makes up only around 28.5% of the total population.
* **62%** of all cases are classified as women. 

***Social / Gov't policies***. In the last two weeks,

* **Testing criteria have been significantly expanded.** Now you only need to experience one of an [expanded list of symptoms]( to call and get tested. 
* **Household bubbles are a thing.** Your household can exclusively "bubble" with one other household, meaning you can gather without having to observe the social distancing requirements. Bubbles also don't need to respect the five-person social gathering limit, and can gather in public together. The language of the new provision is controversial ("Immediate family household" is the term they use) and required clarification.
* **Home-births and doula services have resumed**. Women can again have midwife-assisted home births where indicated, and for hospital births, they can now have 2 personal attendants for hospital births (allowing for a doula to be present as well as a spouse). Both parents can now visit babies in the NICU together. 
* **Beaches are now open** with social distancing in place, but no lifeguards or change rooms. 
* **Outdoor sport facilities are open** for sailing/boating, golf, tennis, equestrian sports, archery, and paddling.  Playgrounds are still closed. 
* **Camping is still prohibited**. If you own a cottage, or have a seasonal RV camp rental, you can use it. 
* **Businesses and non-profit organizations can operate** **if they can satisfy social distancing requirements.** There are limits in place for unregulated health services, dentists, vets and restaurants/bars. The big exception is personal services (salons) and fitness centres are still not allowed to operate, but the province did provide guidance for how to reopen salons safely in the near future.
* **An Atlantic Canada "bubble" has been hinted at by officials** (that is, loosening travel restrictions between the maritime provinces and Newfoundland/Labrador) given the region's success at containing the virus. But I have no idea how cooperative the other Atlantic provinces are feeling at the moment. My sense is "not very".

 Takeout... to eat or not to eat, that is the question. There is a social media campaign making national news encouraging Canadians to make Wednesday’s “takeout day”. [Global covered it here.](

Currently there is no evidence supporting the spread of Covid-19 through takeout, but also no evidence against it. Considering a growing number of cases are community spread, i.e. with no definitive chain of infection, how is it logical to go as far as encouraging people to order takeout, versus letting people make that decision on their own? 

I’m not anti-takeout by any means, I understand some people do not have the means to cook right now. 

I would like to know if anyone has more information to bring to the table, pros or cons to takeout.

 Science fiction screening Idea 1: A breathalyzer with disposable tips, the machine could have an up to date database of all known viral pathogens, a viral pathogen that doesn't match what's in the database comes out as unknown.

Idea 2: Same as above but using test strips that could possibly react and change color  to what family the pathogen belongs too, example turns blue for flu viruses, green for corona viruses, yellow for rynoviruses ect

Maybe, maybe not but there are alot of improvement that needs to be done after this pandemic and learn from our weaknesses.

 Thoughts for those who are still preparing for COVID-19 Some thoughts I’ve shared with my friends concerning COVID-19. Figured I’d share then here as well. 

If you don’t yet have two weeks of food and medication on hand in your home, go get it now. Don’t wait. Don’t panic, think about what you should have, and intentionally get to the store and buy what you will need. 

If you don’t have fridge or freezer space, then get dry goods and cans. Put them in a box in the corner. Ration out your comfort food (chips, beer, coffee, etc) Store next weeks stuff out of sight or you will eat all your snack and comfort food in three days. 

Don’t let your supplies drop below the two week threshold. At some point, we will all be confined exclusively to our homes unless we have urgent needs. Be prepared and you won’t have those urgent needs. 

Having urgent needs doesn’t include running out of milk. Figure out how to use everything you can afford to have on hand for food and supplies. Canned milk in your coffee is better than nothing if you don’t drink it black. 

Start to think about how you will manage your home if someone who lives there gets ill. Where will the sick person stay/sleep? How do you avoid cross contamination? Two people sick at the same time could be devastating. Think about alternate sleeping arrangements for a time of illness. 

Think about exposed surfaces and clothing. Minimize what will need to be cleaned. Take some clothing out of circulation so that the laundry pile stays manageable. Choose stuff that even your kids can wash for you. Don’t forget about your coats - they are automatically considered contaminated in my house. If they are hard to wash, put them away. 

Start washing sheets regularly. Clothes get washed every day. Change all towels before you go to bed. This is normal for some, but not for everyone. 

Figure out how to cook beans. Think about how you could make cookies. Learn to make soup from chicken bones.  For some of you this is completely foreign. Learn now. You will realize you don’t have everything you need. Then go get out while you can. Remember, minimum two weeks supplies. 

Get your neighbors phone number. Even that guy in the apartment next door you’ve never talked to. Get their number and give them yours. It may become important. 

Do you have a thermometer, acetaminophen and ibuprofen? Do you have cough medication, suppressants and expectorants? FYI, a full bottle at max daily dose only lasts 6 days, so your family of four likely needs more than one bottle.  Are your prescriptions filled? Will they run out soon? Do you have enough refills on the prescription?

There will come a time when most of us will be spending 2-4 weeks without going out for supplies. Build a network with your neighbors so that if they lack something, they can ask you, and you can do the same. 

Don’t delay any longer. 

And most importantly,

If you have excess capacity, consider how you can share. You probably know someone who can’t afford to buy two weeks of supplies above their regular needs. Reach out and offer to help. Support your food bank. Give your tenants and employees the support they need.

 Quarantine Questions from US My fiancé (from Toronto) is planning on visiting me in the US from Sept 1 - Sept 21st. We have a couple questions about the 14-day quarantine plan for visitors into Canada. See below:

1) right now, it just says the mandatory quarantine is until August 31st. While he still plans to quarantine immediately after coming back to Canada, will the mandatory quarantine be extended beyond 8/31? 

2) He lives with his parents but has his own room where he will be staying for most, if not all of the time he’s in quarantine. However, there is only one bathroom in their apartment, is this okay if he cleans and disinfects the bathroom after every use? 

Thank you in advance

 Travel restrictions being eased? So today, the EU announced that as of July 1st, citizens from 14 different countries including Canada can enter Europe without having to quarantine.

These agreements are meant to be reciprocal and they've specifically excluded China becuase they wouldn't allow European citizens to enter China without quarantine.

So, does this mean that Canada has agreed to allow EU citizens into Canada without having to do the 14 day self isolation? Because I've not seen or heard any announcements about it from the Canadian government

 Coworker just came back from Mexico with a slight cough. She did not take any precautions or cover her mouth properly. Should I self isolate after being exposed to her for 3 hours? This all happened on Thursday, literally an hour before they decided to make an announcement that all people who've travelled ANYwhere outside of Canada should self isolate for 14 days. I work in a small retail store that's not too busy and I was supposed to have the day off, but my boss called me in last minute due to a no show. I decided to go in, and half an hour into my shift my coworker (who I haven't seen for over a month) starts coughing around me without covering her mouth. She later reveals that she just came back from a 2 week trip to Mexico with her family and a friend who was very sick with "something" throughout the trip. She seems fine otherwise and told me she's been using natural immune booster to "protect" herself this whole time. She was in very close contact with me and didn't cover her mouth properly whenever she coughed. My boss knew she just came back from vacation, but didn't care to mention anything about it. In fact, he had originally told me I'd be working with someone else so it was a surprise to see her when I entered the store. He has no plan in place if employees happen to get sick. Should I be worried about exposure and self isolate regardless?

 Transmission Dynamics in Kids at an Overnight Camp in Georgia - Published July 31st 2020 I read [THIS PAPER] ( last night in the US CDC’s weekly publication *Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report*. Given the recent publication, it is likely the media will not inform you about this until tomorrow if at all.

The paper describes transmission dynamics of Sars-CoV-2 in an overnight camp in Georgia. 

Background:

* An [attack rate](  is a fancy term for % infected.

* Only kids resident in Georgia attending this camp in Georgia would have had their positive tests counted. Both the numerator of the % infected and denominator of % infected was restricted to only consider Georgia resident camp attendees.

* Camp participants were not required to wear masks but staff were. 

* Overnight camps are an extreme example of a congregate setting with ultra-high exposure. More exposure = higher risk of transmission. Even though they are a bit more extreme than schools, both schools and overnight camps are youth-centric settings with high exposure.

**Key Points:**

*Median age of staff was 17 years. The attack rate for staff was 56%, meaning more than half got infected despite adhering to almost all guidelines (except window opening) and wearing face coverings. 

* In the table, you can see the attack rate for children aged 6-10 was 51%, *not dissimilar* to the staff attack rate. This is despite being a relatively small fraction of kids at the camp.

* There is a pattern showing younger individuals (6-10) were *more* infected than older kids (11-17) {Table 1}.

**My Personal Takeaways**:

Together with the other extremely recent study showing [10x-100x higher viral loads in young kids](  I’m fairly certain returning kids to school may not necessarily harm the kids (although some will undoubtedly be harmed) but will almost certainly turn them in to “super-spreaders”. This is a common pattern with other viruses too. It’s increasingly clear to me that return to school will absolutely increase infections and likely supercharge the epidemiologic curve. My insomnia last night was not necessarily for the kids themselves but for **multigenerational households and older teachers**, who I expect to be a canary in the coal mine of sorts in September. As kids returns to school, I believe mortality can be expected to rise first among elderly teachers and elders living with kids.

 Social contact: How much is too much? My family has been really good citizens the last 6 weeks. Very little social contact with others. One person doing shopping, no friend visits for the kids, etc. Partner and I work from home. 

This last week, we’ve been getting more invites to “get together socially distanced” by sitting on a lawn for a kids birthday (while the kids play...), go for a bike ride with 4-5 other adults, etc. We have declined.

We have gone for a dinner with parents, understanding that we were being monogamous with each other. Both parents are over 70 with history of respiratory issues, though nothing current. Both are healthy atm. 

Turns out that one of the parents has 5 other friends that she walks with during the week. I’m assuming that her friends are also walking or visiting other people too. 

So, what’s too much? I hate being high on my horse, and it sucks telling friends that I can’t go for a ride when I really want to. But what’s the point of all this isolation if I do?
 I’m in AB, by the way.
++++++++++
 Kids are not to blame for the spread of coronavirus we (older Canadians are). I read an article about how students at universities in the states are intentionally getting the virus because it’s just easier and in the long term better for them. I agree with them as a highly educated gen xer who himself is homeschooling children and has been in self isolation since this started in February.

The reason I agree is that this is one of there most important developmental times socially, Feds intellectually, and romantically. After they graduate their job prospect are going to be horrendous and they in all likelihood won’t buy homes or have many kids or be able to afford a reasonable life. A majority will end up living at home working at Starbucks. People will date less and be depressed more. Let them have fun when they can.

Even before the pandemic we created high home prices, low pay or non existent entry level jobs, contract work, high rent. Big debt loads.... as a society we really did a number on kids... they don’t owe us more care than than what we give them.

They are also kids..... government should have been more restrictive from the start and should have prevented creating such avterrible economic system for young people with no assets or parental support

 Here is what comes with self-isolation in Korea My Korean friend sent me these pictures and I thought it was pretty cute so I decided to share them here. He said Korean words on top of each picture just means different cities.

So apparently in Korea, if you've come in contact with an infected person, you are immediately notified and told to self-isolate for 14 days. Then city workers bring you these care packages to your door!! I'm not talking about sick people, these are tens of thousands of healthy people who are self-isolating. How do they have resources to do that is something I'd never find out.

If you happen to get sick with the coronavirus, you get a direct number to the health centre (not 911) where they encourage you to call even at night if symptoms get any worse. No 'busy line' business. Also I heard many people are being hospitalized in Korea and the hospital bill after discharge is somewhere in the $50 range.

Their response is exactly what I'd expect to see from a developed country. On top of that, they are doing a mandatory testing (not just questionnaire/fever screening) on ALL travelers from Europe, while we don't even have the capacity to test symptomatic patients in Toronto. I think Canada can definitely work on improving the health care system. Maybe redistribute tax money to improve health care? We pay more taxes than the Koreans so I don't know how they're doing it when we are struggling so much.

 HWDSB and corona virus How many teachers will not self-quarantine because of reprisal or fear of not getting paid? 

Hello,

Stewards, please forward this email to all HWETL members on your email tree.

 For several weeks, the Local has been trying to get the HWDSB to suspend their Attendance Management Program (AMP) during the Covid-19 "pandemic".  While the board has sent out two memos with advice from Public and the WHO, to remain home from work and self-isolate if you are symptomatic, it has also has the punitive AMP which clearly pressures members to report to work when they are ill.  We felt that these contradictory messages weren't helpful at this time.  Medical professionals have advised the public to remain home if they are symptomatic and not to overtax the medical system with unnecessary visits to doctors (like getting notes for Attendance Management Programs.  The board has so far refused.

However, we do have Collective Agreement Language which states,

L18.03

“The following items are not chargeable to the sick leave plan and shall be without loss of salary:  Quarantine - Any teacher who because of exposure of communicable disease is quarantined or otherwise prevented by Medical Health Authorities from being present for duty.”

 The Local advice is that you follow the advice of your medical practitioner, Public Health, and the WHO.  If you are self-isolating because you are symptomatic, our advice is that you do not feel pressure to return to work.

The Local is working with the board to provide a SFX code for "Quarantine".  If it is not available, please use the SFX code for personal illness and inform your HWETL Vice-President that you have done so.  If possible, please try to acquire some sort of documentation showing that your absence is related to Covid-19.  For example, an email from your medical practitioner.  Please don't go to extreme lengths in order to get this documentation such as violating the advice not to visit a Doctor's office, Urgent Care, or Emergency. 

Of course, if you require medical assistance, HWETL would always want you to access that in whatever manner you feel is necessary.

At some point, the HWDSB may close schools, or have their schools closed.  If this happens, our position, based on the above language, would be that teachers would still receive their pay.  However, as this is uncharted territory, we are not able to guarantee that the board would agree. 

In Solidarity,

Jeff Sorensen

 Ontario doctor rigs up solution to double ventilator capacity in rural hospital An excerpt:

"*In just ten minutes with the help of some extra tubing, Gauthier made it possible to double the number of patients ventilated in the hospital at once, if needed.*

*But there’s a catch: the two patients attached to the same ventilator need to be of similar size and lung capacity. And if one patient declines things will need to be adjusted.*

*It’s not perfect, but as Gauthier put it, “if it comes to last resort, I’m prepared to use it.*”

 Gearing up to restart: Businesses’ need for personal protective equipment / Préparatifs pour la reprise : les besoins des entreprises en matière d’équipement de protection individuelle *\[We are Canada’s national statistical agency. We are here to engage with Canadians and provide them with high-quality statistical information that matters!\]*

Using data collected from the Personal Protective Equipment Survey in July 2020, our new [study]( and [infographic](//www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/11-627-m/11-627-m2020061-eng.htm?utm_source=reddit2&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=statcan_ppd_2020) examine businesses’ demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) and concerns about lack of supply. 

Here are some highlights:

· As of July, a little over two-thirds (69.1%) of businesses operating in the provinces need, or expect to need, PPE to operate in accordance with COVID-19-related public health guidance.

· At least four out of five businesses in accommodation and food services, health care and social assistance, retail trade, and construction require PPE. 

· Of the businesses that need PPE, two-thirds (67.3%) need at least 4 of the 12 types of PPE covered by the Personal Protective Equipment Survey.

.

*\[Nous sommes l’organisme national de statistique du Canada. Nous sommes ici pour discuter avec les Canadiens et leur fournir des renseignements statistiques de grande qualité qui comptent!\]*

À l’aide de données recueillies dans le cadre de l’Enquête sur l’équipement de protection individuelle de juillet 2020, notre nouvel [article]( et notre nouvelle [infographie]( examinent la demande d’équipement de protection individuelle (EPI) des entreprises et leurs préoccupations quant à leur disponibilité.

Voici quelques faits saillants :

· En juillet, un peu plus des deux tiers (69,1 %) des entreprises en exploitation dans les provinces canadiennes avaient besoin ou prévoyaient avoir besoin d’EPI pour exercer leurs activités en respectant les directives des autorités sanitaires liées à la COVID-19.

· Au moins 4 entreprises sur 5 dans les secteurs des services d’hébergement et de restauration, des soins de santé et de l’assistance sociale, du commerce de détail et de la construction ont indiqué avoir besoin d’EPI.

· Parmi les entreprises ayant besoin d’EPI, les deux tiers (67,3 %) ont déclaré avoir besoin d’au moins 4 des 12 types d’EPI mentionnés dans l’enquête.

 Crossing the Border U.S. to CAN - Step-Parent Exemption My question is about the "immediate family" exemption to border crossing. The definition of immediate family member includes "parent or step-parent." (Link including definition: [

My father, who is a Canadian citizen, lives in the U.S. He would like to cross the border to see myself + my siblings (we are all Canadian and live in Canada). Since he is a Canadian citizen, my understanding is that they can't refuse him entry to the country. 

My concern is that his common-law partner, my step-mother, is a U.S. citizen. They have been together for 15+  years, but aren't married, and they do not jointly own any property together.  I'm trying to figure out what documentation they are going to ask for/would satisfy the Border agents that she is in fact my step-mother and would fall under this exemption? Or is an actual marriage a requirement for a person to be a "step-parent" under this rule?

 I live alone in an apartment building and I’m conflicted on whether to stop seeing my friend who lives in my building. Am I taking social distancing too literally? This is a weird situation I’ve found myself in, but it’s been nagging me all week and I don’t really know where to get input without posting here. 

I know that there’s so much we can do with phones and the internet these days, but, I’m curious how people that live alone are coping. I happen to live in apartment building, alone, with no family in town. A very good friend lives on another floor in my building. I’m so conflicted on whether to still hang out when asked to, which came up twice this week. Prior to this, we were effectively roommates, where we’d watch shows together and catch up after work a few times a week. I’ve kept all other friends at distance, resorting to FB/phoning, but I haven’t drawn a line with this particular friend as of today because she’s almost like a roommate (even though we live in separate units). I’ve brought up my concerns, but her rationale is that it will be important to have 1-2 people in our lives that we can see/talk to in person, so long as everyone is aware of the risks, for the sake of mental health. For me, it’s her. However, for her, it’s me, as well as her boyfriend and his roommates (3 total). I don’t disagree - I spent the entire week at home alone aside from my two visits with her, and it was off putting to say the least. However, part of me recognizes that if I’m going to catch the virus, it’s likely going to be through a vector introduced through our visits. 

Should I draw the line and stop seeing her as well? Or is this something I should embrace? I feel fortunate to have a good friend I can see without leaving my building. I just don’t know if I actually should or not anymore.

You are required to self isolate for 14 days.

DO NOT visit stores, family or friends.

Everyone should stay home and stop the spread."

 What's my risk? So our family is me and my wife and a toddler.  Have all been home (in house not appartment) for over two weeks and during those weeks only leave the house once a week (just me, wife and kid stay home) for grocery/pharmacy shop (diligently do not touch face, keep distance, and wash hands upon return) and for daily walks/runs outdoors.

My question is, is this enough?  If we keep this up for as long as it takes will we be ok or are we still going to get it anyways? I've seen estimates that 70% of people will get this, but is my current lifestyle enough to get us into that 30%?

 Can anyone help? Please. I applied for my EI weeks ago, I had to wait for my ROE to come in because there was one last pay period going through. I got the ROE, signed in to do my internet reporting.

My internet reporting is now saying i have to call to verify my identity and when I try to register for MSCA it says i have to verify my identity as well?
All my info matched I didnt do anything different and the lines have been tied up for *days*.

Is there another way I can contact them to get this fixed. I do need the money obviously to sustain my bills and my tuition for school. 

If anyone needs more info please ask. I am bordering  on frantic so if i wasn't clear please let me know.

 Received COVID Alert App Notice - "You've been exposed in the last 14 days". Downloaded the Covid Alert App from Health Canada on July 31, the day it came out.  

Other than my immediate family, I have been close-ish to 8 people, all are close friends &amp; family.  We were always outside, 6 - 8 feet away, wearing masks.  I have confirmed that none of them have even installed the app, and only one has ever gone for a test (was needed before routine surgery). 

The only other possibility is I sat in the car with closed windows while my wife went into a store (only 1 family member allowed in at a time).  There were maybe a dozen people that walked by the car, or drove up and parked and I saw another guy sitting in his car waiting as well.  

&amp;#x200B;

The app says to go get tested, but I truly think this is an error or a hack.

 The family exemption for the US Border is misleading; just wanted to let you all know before you attempt to cross. My Mom just tried to come over the border from the US and was denied. I just wanted to let you guys know why.

I'm a permanent resident. The family exemption said immediate family members can come visit, including Parents. The border officer told my Mom that line means: "If you are visiting your parents". As in, my Mom visiting her parents. I guess having my Mom come visit me isn't considered "immediate family".

They also told her she'd have to quarantine for 14 days upon entry to Canada, inside of Canada, BEFORE she could come to my house. I wrote a letter stating her and my entire family would be doing isolation for 14 days as requested, but they said she has to isolate separate from us before she can come to us.

So yeah. Just letting others know before you get your hopes up. The wording was very misleading.

Best of luck to all of you who are separated from your families....

 Pressure from family to visit, have dinner with and share a cabin for a week as a potentially high risk person. Looking for any insight on our situation I don’t know how high risk I am but I had asthma as a kid/teen but I haven’t had any issues with it for a long long time. I’ve heard that getting sick enough could trigger it again even though I haven’t had a puffer in many years. I was also taking hydroxychloroquine (an immune suppressant) for the last 6 months as of last Sunday I’ve stopped taking it (doctor approved). 

I’ve been treating myself as high risk but my boyfriends family is putting a fair bit of pressure on us to visit which we have done outside and not eating or drinking anything but we get pressured to eat treats like cakes and tea or coffee. It’s uncomfortable having to repeatedly say no we are ok thanks over and over again. We’ve told them why we are being so careful but it hasn’t really helped. 

With Father’s Day coming up my bf and his brothers are taking him to go golfing, which is fine in my book (outside and easy enough to distance from each other) but after they want us to come for dinner. The couple times we’ve been there they don’t do a very good job keeping distance and again we are constantly pushed to eat and drink. Plus I’m pretty sure they will want to be inside (this would likely be a 9 person gathering from 4 households). 

This is where I think I might be being overly cautious but I don’t really feel like they are being careful enough. They are eating fast food, grocery shopping every week, and the brothers with their SO’s are hanging out with friends and family a fair bit. Camping and hiking not really keeping distance from what I can tell from pictures. 

On top of all this before all this went down we were planning on sharing a cabin for a week in July and they still want to do it. It looks like three out of the nine might not be there but still I don’t think it’s a good idea. But at the same time am I being ridiculous? I don’t know I’m high risk.. And the number of new cases in B.C. is continuing to drop... the chances that any of them have been in contact with someone contagious might be pretty unlikely. Buuuttt... my mom recently had their first positive case at her work...  

Basically, we are having trouble dealing with it diplomatically and rationally as someone who may be high risk.

 Drivers license expiring. Self-quarantined can't renew. Need car to help old parents. My parents are old and will die if they get covid.  They both are senile and need help and I am taking care of them.  My household is quarantined so we don't get sick and give it to my parents. They live 20 minutes drive away.  I need to drive so I can help them.  I don't want to go into the thing to renew my licence because I don't want germs.  I am worried about bringing the virus to my parents.  But I need a driver's license so I can drive to them.  If I don't they will starve or try to light a fire or something.

What can I do?

Why aren't they just letting us drive on expired licenses until this is all over?  Or let us do it online?

 I got 9 exposure matches on the same day, all were on sep 23 at different times. Can someone explain what this means? I am so mind boggled. 

- I have not seen my friends physically since the beginning of August. 
- i go to work. But, i work in the stockroom, I almost never come onto the shop floor, and if i do, its not for more than 15 minutes and within 2 metres of anyone
- at work, i work with 2-3 people at the back. 
- when i leave work, I GO HOME. i have not eaten in any food setting. I dont shop around. I do my groceries, but even then, i am never within 2 metres of someone for more than 15 minutes. 
- so I literally drive to work, work in the back, and COME HOME. 
- i have not been to a single gathering, or a single coffee shop or restaurant. When I ordered food, i take it and go. It is never longer than 15 mins let alone within 2 m of someone.

What does getting 9 different checks, all logged in the same day, mean !!!! Please and thank you

 travel from Quebec to Ontario A friend of mines family member has recently passed away in Ontario from cancer and would like to visit her family.. is it possible for her to go? would it be considered essential travel?

 My Family came back from U.S. should I Self-Isolate too? My family came back from states last week. At that time, the airport simply "recommended" ppl who came back to self-isolate for 14 days, and they told the family can still go outside. Now the government is saying self-isolating of those who came back from abroad is a "must", and that there will be fines if violated. Now I wonder if I should self-isolate too, since I'm living one who came back from abroad. Since I couldn't find any article mentioning about the families, I guess it should be fine? I couldn't check my mail for so long u\_u

 Question - what's the rule on meeting up with someone indoors in Ontario? Safe / allowed if 2 metres apart, or is it only if they are part of your 'social bubble'? I'm not sure I'm confused because the most up to date rules I've found say that the max number of people indoors for a gathering is currently 50, but it also mentions sticking with your social group of 10 people. I'm a bit confused.

So let's say me and 4 friends of mine want to meet at my house - would we have to hang out outdoors or would we be able to hang out indoors if we were all 2 metres apart from each other? If so, would we have to wear masks? It's not a big deal to us anyway and we'll probably hang out outdoors just to be on the safe side(our city hasn't had a covid case for a hot while but hey let's not risk it) but I want to understand the regulations.

Sorry if it's a dumb question, I've just been getting a lot of conflicting information from friends and family and I'm getting confused by the stage 3 guidelines, though I imagine I'm just being dumb and it's pretty clear there haha. 

Thanks for the help!

 My Manager just sent a email suggesting to everyone its fine to visit family members and go shopping while on self-isolation. All the health agencies say the opposite.  I work for a major airline, in a fairly busy international airport.  This is part of the email he sent today regarding COVID-19

* *Big differences between self-isolation and quarantine. Please do not interchange.*
   * *Self-isolation is used a precaution. Can usually still see family members, fly back home/drive home, go to groceries when required, etc. Unknown if positive of the virus. Risk is the same as everyone else*
   * *Quarantine means that they have been to the hospital and have been tested positive. They are mandated and kept at a quarantine facility. Separated from family. Cannot leave facility. Not able to fly"*

Everything I've read on various Government health sites clearly states that people on self-isolation should remain at home and avoid any contact with others.  Should i say something to him about this? It feels like this could be dangerous misinformation.

All the gov sites say taking care of a sick loved one is considered essential travel, but as it’s my BFs father, not mine, and me and my BF are not common law is there a chance I would get turned away, most concerned with BC and the Alberta provincial borders? 
The general jist I get is that travel it is “not recommended” and I assume they are using the honour system when questioning folks coming in? 
Anyone traveling by car from Alberta- BC can confirm?

 Is nobody taking this seriously? I don't know anyone who's taking this seriously.

We have friends and family in China not all of them made it.

But we've been following covid 19 since the beginning of January.

In my house if you go to a store and come back you strip naked at the door everything goes into a washing machine you go take a shower all of your groceries are wipe down or washed . 

Your keys your phone your wallet get cleaned.

And our friends in China are telling us that we're not trying hard enough. and that if everyone's not doing at a very minimum what our house is doing this isn't going to change soon. 





Everyone else I know that I've told how we do things has responded with, "I'd rather just get the virus then go through what you're doing."

And these are very educated people.some of which work in the health sector others in education.

 Quarantine the elderly and ill? Now that we have hit our peak, would it be wrong to lift the current enforcements on the young/healthy? Yes I understand the chance for a second wave but if we just force the elderly and those with immune issues could the rest of us not get back too normal? 

I mean we’re all adults here and we should be able to decide if we are ‘healthy enough’ to face the risk of contracting Covid. As long as anybody over sixty or over a certain bmi is ordered too stay indoors than I don’t really see much of an issue.

 How should we explain self isolation to kids? We have 2 kids and live in a basement apartment of a house that has 4 kids upstairs. We have decided to self isolate, on a day to day basis, maybe 2 weeks, maybe just until we sort out new information, etc.
We have a door between units and kids are back and forth all day. Our kids love playing with the kids upstairs and get upset if they can't play with them every day. But there are 4 adults up there, 2 parents and two grandparents. One of the things we want to assess in the coming days, before opening that door again, is what commitment the adults upstairs have in social distancing, how serious are they taking this? I'm sure in a few days most people will have come around and we can ease up perhaps. 
Anyway, tomorrow we have to tell them they can't play with their friends for we dont know how long. Our kids suck at washing hands and social distancing. If adults in either household are/get infected, it'll spread to all of us through kids.
Until now we'd been telling them that we're unlikely to get it, and if we did it would be mild. Things I can't promise them anymore. They're homeschooled and have not be exposed to playground gossip. They are a bit anxious but obviously don't grasp what's going on. 
I know we want to not lie to them. But the truth has us shook.  We want to be just honest enough to have this lockdown make sense, but we also want them not to be terrified.
How are you explaining the need to stay home right now to your kids?

 How to report mass gatherings in Canada? Is reporting mass gatherings still a thing in Canada? If so, how can I do it?

Yesterday afternoon there was a huge gathering on the street right in front of my house. I have no idea what they were doing. There were 36 people that I counted at the start, but more came later. Pickup trucks with families inside kept driving up and down the street over and over, waving signs out the window (they were going too fast and I'm on the 2nd floor so I couldn't read what they said). The trucks were also honking nonstop, which is what made me look out the window in the first place because I thought there was an accident or something. Different families kept pulling up in their cars, parking on the side of the road, getting out and standing there watching the trucks pass by and talking to each other. At some point the trucks stopped in the street and a bunch of the families went up to them and they talked to each other through the window. All these families were standing right next to each other, like almost touching shoulders. No one was wearing a mask. And the worst part, there were like 13-14 kids, all of whom were playing and talking to each other, hugging and touching each other when they were playing. This went on for about an hour. There were so many cars lined up on the street. I don't know who any of them were because I'm not close with my neighbours and also a lot of them came from other streets.

Obviously this is a huge concern with Covid-19 going around, none of them were following social distancing rules or wearing masks. Is there a way to report mass gatherings? What they did is really dangerous and I'm concerned about the health of the kids especially since they touched a bunch of people. I seem to recall hearing on the news that a few weeks ago people were reporting mass gatherings but I can't remember if it was in Canada or the states. I live in Ontario, not sure if there's a specific hotline per province or something.

 Nova Scotia hospital restrictions expanding Excerpts from the Central (CDHA, as was) Coronavirus update #8:

"Updates were provided today in a Special Bulletin from the office of the Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Robert Strang regarding screening and travel. Updates include:

 

·         Information to the screening tool on the referral for COVID-19 testing from a community setting.

·         Returning travellers from Italy, Iran and Hubei Province in China are required to self-isolate.


Anyone who has travelled outside Canada may have come in contact with the novel coronavirus and should closely monitor their health for 14 days after returning to the country. Travelers who start to feel unwell, should stay at home/self-isolate away from the public. Individuals who develop a fever, with a temperature 38°C or higher, and/or cough should call 811 for assessment."

"Visitor Limitations

Today, NSHA implemented a visitor limitation directive at all facilities across the province to prevent the spread of any respiratory illness, including COVID-19. A patient can name up to two people who will be their family or primary support person/people. The person(s) chosen as family/primary support person may change over time as specified by the patient. The patient will be asked to notify the health care team about who their family/primary support people are, and visitation will be limited to those individuals. Special consideration will be made on a case by case basis. Sites have been provided with posters for distribution. "

"Assessment Centres

On March 10, NSHA opened several COVID-19 assessment centres across the province. Two more were opened today, one at St. Martha’s Regional Hospital and the other at Dartmouth General Hospital.

These assessment centres will further support efforts to identify and contain COVID-19 in Nova Scotia and are intended to help lessen current pressures in emergency departments, while also decreasing the possibility of transmission among the public. To learn more, watch Dr. Todd Hatchette, Chief of Microbiology, and Bethany McCormick, Senior Director, Strategy, Planning and Performance in a [video on COVID-19 assessment centres](

 Advice for mid 60s parents with diabetes and other health concerns that is finding it hard to properly self isolate My mom (mid 60s) has type 2 diabetes and needs fruit and veg regularly to manage her blood sugar problems.

She has had a couple health incidents because of her blood sugar levels in the past couple of weeks. My dad has been having to go into the stores to buy her the things she needs. He also has hypertension along with a few other underlying issues. 

They really do want to minimize exposure, but she needs fruit and veg like its medicine.

 Sister in law coming to Canada Hi,

My sister in law booked her ticket to Canada for this week. She’s a USA green card holder. Has never been to Canada. She recently made a plan to come to our house in Canada due to some marital issues with her husband.

I’ve told her that border is closed due to covid and that’s she’s not eligible but she wants to “try” anyways. I don’t have the heart to say anything further as I don’t want to hurt her feelings. I understand she has to quarantine for 14 days which we haven’t planned for yet since we don’t think she can even board the plane. Please don’t give me rude comments about how irresponsible this is as I’m trying to handle the situation the best way I can. I don’t want to put any person’s health at risk. 

What are her chances of getting on the plane? Are they pretty lax about the rules or do they actually enforce them at the airport?

She’s not in the list of family that can come to Canada at this time as per the government website.

 “We’ve run errands for more than 3,000 families”: How a local Muslim youth association is helping people buy groceries and fill prescriptions - COVID Community Support [

"Three days later, on March 24, we launched a volunteer initiative called Neighbourhood Helper to assist people who needed help with errands and couldn’t risk going outside, whether they were elderly, they were immunocompromised, or they had mobility issues.

When a community member needs help—buying groceries, filling prescriptions or any other emergency errand—they can fill out a form on our website or call our hotline number. The hotline redirects to 11 designated volunteers who are on call 24/7. Whoever picks up the phone call first will record the person’s name, their address and what kind of assistance they need, then get in touch with the youth leader in the area where the resident lives. Each chapter has one youth leader and anywhere from 30 to 100 members—a total of some 6,000 members across Canada and over 4,000 members in the Toronto area alone. The youth leader then assigns the task to a volunteer member. Once they’re done, they report back so we can make sure that task has been completed."
