 Advice Needed: moving help Forgive me if this is off topic but I’m fairly certain this is allowed here.

I live in Ontario, Canada. In two weeks I will be moving to a house 40 mins away to a very rural area. Currently I live in a rental townhouse in a suburb (not in the city). 

I’m honestly extremely worried about this. Worst case scenario if movers aren’t available, will I be able to just move myself over the course of a few days... right? Even if we do go on lockdown, will I still be able to leave my house and drive to the new one?

A lot will be changing in the coming weeks. I just need reassurance that I will still be able to move. Or will I not be able to move?

Thoughts?

 A new found respect for Premier Ford Like him or hate him, the man is doing a good job. When he first came to power, I, along with others, thought he, like his brother, was a joke. "Buck-A-Beer" fiasco. He thought the job would be a walk in the park, pursuing his own agenda. But his tough stance on COVID-19 these past few months has proven him to be a tough leader. Is he or his cabinet perfect? Of course not. Tell me one politician in the last 100 years anywhere in the world who has been fault-free and perfect. There aren't any. He may be brash and offensive to most, but when things got tough, his true identity emerged and the man got things done, the best they could. 

I'm well aware that there are those who complain for the sake of complaining. They have always been around. They simply hate and disagree with the existence of the entire universe and everything in it. And now, thanks to the Internet, they have a voice. Doesn't mean they are right. It won't matter who is in charge, the same vocal minority with **always** find something to BMW about. (Bitch, Moan, Whine). I fully expect them to assault this post with their usual tirade.

Getting back to the topic here. Ford surprised me and many others, and if an election were to be held tomorrow, I'm sure many that didn't vote for him the last time would change their mind. He is doing his best to keep us safe. It's a difficult decision, the loss of jobs and income and livelyhood vs. the safety of us all. \mess up, he will come after you. This is where the tough Ford family excels. It's as if the door bouncer has become the manager and is running things better.

 If your looking for hand sanitizer try the retailer Yesstyle Yesstyle is a korean beauty website but they sell stuff like hand sanitizer too. They all small ones but they aren’t super jacked up in price. They also sell hats with face shields (like clear plastic attached to a hat). I’m not sure how effective the hat thing will be but I bought one for an elderly family member.

Just pay attention and make sure the items you add to your basket are in stock/ship in 24 hours because some of there stuff has to be sent from another place to their western shipping department, so select in stock/ship in 24 hours items.

They have free shipping over 50$.

 Can you decline returning to work Ontario citizen here the reason why I'm asking is because well I'm afraid, I have people close to me that have  compromised immune systems and some respitory issues

 Not allowed working from home even with high risk illnesses I work in hearing healthcare. I'd say like 95% of our clients are 80+ years old. We are not closing down - we all received an email saying we are expected to continue working:

&gt;You are expected to continue to work in the same manner. Working from home is not permitted without an accommodation, as per our current Human Resources Policies.

This is in Toronto. Every employee commutes. I sent HR an email asking if they had any sort of TTC plan for the employees who are on twice a day five times a day. They responded saying so long as Toronto Public Health keeps running the TTC, we are expected to continue getting to work that way.

I have multiple health issues and my immune system is compromised by multiple medications I'm on. I have two chronic illnesses as well as allergies and asthma. If I get sick, I will suffer. This is an awful plan and my work does not care. Trudeau does not care. The government does not care. Ontario is doing absolutely nothing. I messaged my manager last night sending her the CDC's list of high risk pre-existing conditions, showing her how every health issue I have is listed on there. She said she messaged HR but they still expect me to come in.

I called in sick today. I cannot leave the house. I cannot use public transit anymore. When I come home from work I've been immediately showering and Lysol down everything I own and have brought out in public. I'm using rubber gloves on TTC. But I can't do this anymore with the rate of people being infected - for all I know, I already have this.

Hearing healthcare is non essential, I've been told this as long as I have worked there. With the amount of high risk clients, commuters, lack of support from my workplace - what can I do? I'm totally out of sick days and today is an unpaid day. I know that Trudeau will be making his 1pm announcement today, but I'm expecting another "let's wash our hands lols" statement. We learned nothing from SARS and I expect nothing from our government.

Does anybody have any suggestions? What can I do? I am considering Uber-ing, but I don't have the money to do that daily. My work is doing nothing beyond giving us a lot of Lysol to clean with (ourselves) and telling us to wash our hands. It is my job to screen every single client who comes in by asking if they've been to whatever country, but at this point, that is way too late. If they say yes, I'm exposed. Since this is a place for Deaf/HOH people, we scream in their face and/or sign, and there is no way we are 6 feet apart. As seen in that email from HR, they won't let anybody work from home, and even though I tried to get accommodations, (seemingly reasonable to me, I have four high risk diseases listed by CDC) and they won't allow me to. Is it time to quit? Is there anything I can do to protect my health?

 I work in construction, and we shouldn't be working As a worker in the industry, I can say we are not able to follow the hygiene and social distance measures recommended by health officials. We have two washrooms with hand washing stations, and the rest have no sanitizer. We have no masks. No one can order more of these supplies....they don't exist. 

I'm scared to go to work on Monday. I'm scared for everyone else who has to go to work in any non essential industry. We are actively spreading disease. 

How do we get our sites shut down? Can someone start a petition? I'm bad at computers and don't know where to start.

 I'm having a moment I feel like we've all had our moments in this crazy ass time, and I'm definitely going through a moment right now. I am currently 27 weeks pregnant at home awaiting my Covid test results. I'm in a highly Covid-affected city. I work at a school with 7 confirmed cases, and many students out with results pending (and yet the school ins't shut down...). I don't feel safe at work. It is not because of a lack of PPE, or a lack of admin support. It is because that, even with all of the hard work and money that has been put into making schools safe, it just isn't enough. As much as I try, the exposure is still very real. And I know there are SO many people working and exposed - I feel for all of you. I just am so sad that I feel like I have no choice but to expose myself and my unborn baby. I don't understand how we went from a 100% lock down in the first wave, to being forced back to work in the second (and what will definitely be a worse) wave. My mind just can't comprehend it. I know it's expensive and will do ridiculous damage to our economy to shut down again, but I just can't wrap my head around the risk. Anyway, I don't want to debate. I don't want this to be political. I just am struggling emotionally, mentally and physically and am not sure what to do.
++++++++++
 Hypothetical Question: What are the chances of a second shutdown? I’m asking this as I always hear that a second wave will surely cancel school in Alberta. I always make sure to ask everyone I know and they all say before Christmas it’ll shut down again. I personally think that if it does it will be around March 16th like last time. What do you think? 

This question is open to not just Albertans, but to every other Canadian! Have a safe back to school!

 Construction a part of “critical infrastructure”? Is construction considered an essential service or “critical infrastructure” at this time? My SO is in construction and is planning on visiting next month. He told his boss he would have to quarantine for 2 weeks upon arrival, which works out because there was a permit issue with the next project, so he won’t be needed until that gets sorted. His boss said that the permit might come through sooner and that he should come to work if so because he is exempt from the quarantine mandate since construction is considered an essential service. Can anyone confirm? Does the boss have to “register” the business as an essential service?
++++++++++
 I need to vent. I'm so sick of hearing rich people, or even the highest of the middle class complaining about being in this quarantine while being lucky enough to be paid for doing absolutely nothing and/or work from home or even get full EI pay check even if it is not THAT high. I'm sick of hearing influencer getting paid to do what they do while staying home complaining about being "sO bOrEd" and saying how hard it is. 

This is really taking a toll on the poorest and the homeless people. I'm so scared that they're gonna let them die on the street. It's taking a toll on small business owners who had to close permenantly because closing for 3 weeks was not an option they could afford.

Please people, we're all in the same boat of isolation, but please, stop complainigng when you have a roof over your head, when you have enough money to feed yourself and your children, when you are healthy enough to not have to worry too much about it taking your life and make permanent damage. When you don't have to worry about your landlord kicking you out and becoming homeless. 

And please if you have a yard and a big house above all of this. You have no right to complain, some people are going to die because they could not afford to live through a pandemic. Some people don't even have enough money to have the internet.

But please, still stay safe, stay home, everyone is important but don't forget some people are less fortunate than you are...

 #FlattenTheCurve and Employer non-responsiveness? I've been debating something and wanted to get other opinions. I'm in the Greater Toronto area and my wife works in one of the tallest office towers in downtown Toronto, taking the bus and subway each day to get there. 

As we see Italy warn others to distance 'now', and cities getting caught repeatedly behind the curve, I'm able to take us from Toronto to a remote town, but my wife's employer is still sitting on their hands. They are likely waiting for Toronto Public Health or Ontario to tell them to start social distancing before acting. My wife's job can 100% be completed from a remote computer, as with all her colleagues. The firm has not planned ahead as far as laptops or VPN and a few weeks ago a senior partner advised "the flu kills more people", which I'm sure is clearly being rethought at this time.

Dilemma: I am debating anonymously emailing the HR department to politely suggest that their staff are in fear of losing their job by asking, but very concerned about their safety and asking them to move as a company before they are caught with positive cases in the huge building.

It's likely not my place, but I've patiently waited and no action is unfolding. If we really have a chance to #flattenthecurve it doesn't happen if everyone waits too long.

I know many other good working people are in the same boat and stressed. Am I over-reacting? Is this not a risk that could be reduced now? Isn't what we see globally enough of a warning to urge proactivity?

What are others thinking? Thank you folks.

 What are some of the impacts of Covid-19 on your industry that most people outside the industry wouldn't know or think about? I've seen a few posts from farmers, educators and health care workers, and spoken with friends and family about some of the impacts to their jobs or industries. It has made me curious what some of the lesser known impacts are across these and other industries. 

If really love to hear from people across a wide variety of industries - farming, manufacturing, trades, energy, retail, commerce, finance, forestry, education, tech, business... You name it! 

If you're able, it would also be interesting to hear your take on what can or should be done to address those impacts. And if you're comfortable, share what your role is in that industry (corporate exec, small business owner, management, journeyman, labourer, admin...)

 EMS radio scanner chatter reveals the true horrors of COVID-19 pandemic I downloaded the "Scanner Radio" app yesterday after hearing a lot about the "Brooklyn Fire and Hatzolah and EMS dispatch" channel. It was just nonstop calls of "patient having difficulty breathing" (COVID) with dispatch reading out a steady stream of addresses. It's absolutely tragic what's happening. 

I tuned into the [Ottawa Area EMS, Fire &amp; OPP]( channel for a couple of hours overnight to hear what was happening locally and holy shit. Its worse than I imagined. Nothing but "shortness of breathe" calls back to back. I must've heard at least 12-15 calls, some horrifying : "patient is coughing blood with trouble breathing", "25 year old patient has high fever, shortness of breathe and losing feelings to arms" and dispatch kept repeating  "covid positive" after describing these calls. 

Ive been reading about this historic crisis almost everyday for the past month but listening to it unfold in my hometown last night was truly sobering. It gave me a whole different perspective and appreciation for what first responders and front line healthcare workers are up against while I'm safe at home.

 To those who are now working from home - be as productive as you can and maybe after this is all done employers will realize WFH is a great option!

 Traveling from Europe to Canada in July Hey there. This will be kinda our of the loop a little bit but it refers to coronavirus so I'm sorry if I'm totally off topic. I fell in love with a Canadian woman and she fell in love with me. The thing is, we met while she was in Europe, than she flew back to Canada before everything closed down and pandemic broke off and then fell in love through calls and texts, now we're unable to meet until at least July as Canada doesn't allow any foreigners to enter the country. Does anybody have any info if there's a possibility that they could extend the travel ban further than July or possibly knows someone who came to Canada from Europe and how did they manage to get in the country or if I could expect that July's travel will be possible?

 Volunteer work during covid 19 Hi, 

I'm a 24 year old chef who is currently out of work due to the pandemic. I've been at home for about two weeks now and it's getting the best of me. I saw an article with the Quebec premier basically calling on all healthy young people to donate their time and go volunteer. I am sure I could be very helpful at the local soup kitchen, but I am also concerned about getting the virus. There are a lot of cases in Quebec and a lot of dumb people who have been caught going around town after being tested positive. 

Just wondering, would you do it? Are you doing it? What's it like?

 Awaiting PR approval, how does this affect me/those like me? Hello! Sorry if this question has been asked, direct me to a previous post if need be!

I’m currently awaiting PR approval, it’s due in January. I’m also awaiting my work visa renewal, which I was told in April it could be quite some time. I’m from the UK originally, lived here for 3+ years, have phone plans and addresses and such.

With these new loosened restrictions, what are my options for visiting my sister who lives in the US? Is she able to come here? Or do the restrictions not apply because I’m awaiting PR status? Am I able to visit the US and come back? Or will they not let me back in? I’m nervous of that for a few reasons, namely because it’s very much at the discretion of the border officer I’m dealing with, AND I’m still doing my required amount of time in Canada for PR approval. But surely they can’t just leave me/others with ZERO options for visiting family during a worldwide pandemic?

Any information/firsthand stories/links are very very welcome, thank you!

 Larger construction sites need shut down now I am an electrician.  On construction sites you can multiple trades, up to a few hundred people, depending on site size, working in close proximity, sharing portable lavatories with one and other.  Those WCs are already disgusting at times, though it depends upon which rental company they come from.  


I have spoken at length with many people who work in this field.  A lot of them don't give a damn, think it is over blown, some actually still think that this is a some conspiracy.  Construction workers are notorious for not giving a shit about their health.  We are asking for trouble.  For their own protection and the protection of others, it must be shut down.  


Today I convinced the general contractor on my job to limit the site to one trade at a time.  I told him straight that he opens himself up for potential liability issues if he does not have a cogent COVID-19 policy and take steps in order to ensure the health and safety of his trades and the sub-trades on site.  He was quite receptive to the idea and understands that the job will take longer, but honestly the building owners will understand due to the extenuating circumstances.  


If you work in construction, conversations need to be had with GCs and site supers.  If there is no written, coherent plan then there needs to be.  Unfortunately, we risk spreading this disease to others in the community, and to vulnerable family members.  Often times if we don't work we do not get paid, and the job protection legislation within our province is terrible (no paid leave, paltry vacation pay etc, hopefully further conversations open up regarding this in the future as it is a serious weakness within our economy).  But this is bigger than us and it is our civic responsibility in order to prevent a further catastrophe.  We can all get back to work if we suffer in the short term.  Everyone is going to suffer.  


TL:DR: The government should just shut construction to fuck down.  It's not essential.

 Unable to work So I really don’t know where to post this and if anyone could redirect me I’d appreciate it. So I was on unemployment because I was sick for a few months.

 Registered with ArriveCAN app, but told I do not need to quarantine. How to proceed? Registered with arrivecan app, but told no need to quarantine.... what to do?

So I picked up a rescue dog from the US border. We met volunteers that picked the dogs up from the airport. The dogs came from from Mexico.

Note we met in the park, and at no time did I go through the US border. Never even entered a building or was within 6 feet of anyone.

Well we were told we would have to quarantine ahead of time just because we were in the park and had to take the dogs to the Canada Customs. So I filled out the ArriveCAN app. But I guess it’s entirely depends on the border agent. Border agent seemed pissed we were at customs because were never in the states. He said No Quarantine. I even confirmed with him.

The problem is that because I was proactive I’m now getting notifications to Quarantine from the App. Fuck me for being proactive! There is no way to cancel my arrivecan submission now. Also the app barely works. Some of the buttons like the Get Help button are inactive.

So my question is: do you the border agents give quarantine paperwork if you are required?

Essentially if I get caught not in quarantine, all I have is the word of an angry border agent. I called a corona virus number and she confirmed I don’t need to quarantine... but again I only have the word of someone not super knowledgeable on the phone. I’ve since sent an email hoping to get some written proof.

BTW: please note I’m not being irresponsible. I work from home and have been extremely covid safe. I don’t have any plan to travel. I just want to know I can go to a park, grocery store, etc.

TLDR: does the government give/keep quarantine paperwork to those required to quarantine when you entered?

 Waited on hold for 20 minutes for the hotline, here’s what they said. So I called the ‭1 (833) 784-4397‬ hotline, this morning as I started feeling a bit of a chest discomfort and mild cough Monday with it developing into a cough, upper chest pain, and a mild fever, I’m 19 years old and work across typically 4 different grocery stores per work day 4 days a week. At each store I’m exposed to at least 200 people per store. Plus I’m a student and have been in large class gatherings. Deciding to take the necessary precautions I told my supervisor my situation who thankfully immediately stated to go home. I waited for 20 minutes on hold and when they finally answered they said to call 811. However 811 isn’t accepting cases for people who haven’t been out of country in the last 14 days.

I really don’t know what to do now, both my parents are compromised in some way and the last thing I want to do is spread anything to them.

I’m really hoping it’s just allergies or I’ve scared myself into thinking I’m sick but I’m worried for the worst.

 Sobeys Hero Pay (what they didn’t tell you) Sobeys announced in their press release stating all employees would get an extra $2 an hour, and $50 extra dollars a week to anyone who works over 20 hours, including full timers who work just as much or more as their managers.

What they DIDN’T release to the public was that the department managers are all getting $500 per week. 10x more what a full timer in that department will get for working the same amount of hours under the same amount of risk. Does Sobeys value the lives of their department managers that much more? Is this right and I am missing the point somewhere? I could get fired for posting this, but what’s a job worth anymore these days. My manager hasn’t been in my store since cases were announced in my province and he will be getting 10x more than what I will be. And I worked well over 130 hours.

But this behaviour has left me crying and fearful I dug my own job into the grave for doing, what i believe, is the right thing.

 Driving to Vancouver from Toronto Hi guys
I have been asked to commercially transport someone's car to Vancouver start of June.
I'm trying to consider taking the job, it'll be 7-9 days to drive there. 
I'm in a lowrisk category but obviously would be extremely careful not to come into close proximity with others.

Just wondering if it would be incredibly stupid to take this job at the moment?

Also does anyone know:
- do I need to self quarantine at Vancouver for 2 weeks?
- do I need to self quarantine when I return for 2 weeks?

 Wtf is wrong with this government, why not AT LEAST encourage people that can to work from home? I work for a government agency. Our office is in the middle of downtown, right by the Eaton Centre. We’ve gotten two vague emails about washing our hands and staying home when sick. Even though I would like my organization to take steps on their own, I know they are relying on the government to tell them what to do. There are soooo many jobs that people COULD work from home, some already work 2-3 days from home, why not encourage those that can to do so? Why not even start thinking about this possibility and make sure everyone has the right tools to work from home efficiently? Has our government learned nothing from the cries of help from other nations? Will it take someone to fall ill from our office? I don’t understand why we’re being so reactive as opposed to proactive, it’s disheartening to say the least :(

 How persistent is the COVID cough? Hey guys.

So I'm living with someone right now.. We have seperate rooms. They haven't been out (neither have I) much since the pandemic except to buy groceries (their last trip was about 13 days ago, I ordered mine).

They've been having this cough all week. But it was just once or twice every few hours. But this morning, their sibling (who's now staying with us bc school closed) has been coughing more frequently. They've been coughing like once or twice every 5 minutes.

How persistent is the COVID cough? How do I know if I'm overthinking or not?

We live in the scarborough/markham area for reference.

 Should I apply for CERB?? Should I still apply for Canada emergency response benefit if I don’t qualify, or go to work?

I’m a student who worked a few jobs here and there and made about $4300 in the last year. I’ve been struggling to find a permanent part time job (worked many seasonal or temp positions) and I got laid off from my job back in February for reasons unrelated to covid. 

My family keeps breathing down my neck to apply because apparently the government is accepting all applicants. However, I heard that next year when tax season hits, the government will make you pay it all back if you didn’t qualify. I have a job lined up where I’ll be working full time starting next week, and I’m thinking of just working instead of trying to finesse the cerb system, but my family keeps discouraging me because it’s not safe. 

What should I do? Realistically, if I apply for cerb- would I get the money? And how much would I have to pay back next year?

 Job is putting all of us at risk and more because of COVID I work at a fast food restaurant here in Canada and my job is putting myself, all our employees and customers at risk. Recently we were told if you traveled anywhere outside of Canada you were not to return to work and to quarantine yourself for 2 weeks in case you may have COVID and spread it around. 2 of our employees have traveled to the US and have since returned to work. The reason is pretty simple, we aren't getting paid if we have to quarantine ourselves so they feel like they have to return to work if they want to be able to pay bills. Many of us don't qualify for EI because our business isn't closing due to the virus so we can't get any support. Many of us are being pressured to take extra shifts as anyone who calls in sick is not allowed to return to work for 2 weeks and their shifts are posted. Many of us are working more than 50 hours a week with little sleep and are scared of not coming in and not being able to survive. Many of our rights are being ignored. Today I didn't not recieve a break after working for over 5 hours straight and decided to just leave as no one would allow me my break. Many people are working 12 hour shifts and expected to go home and come back in for more work without the legal 8 hour downtime. Employees are scared of getting sick and they are scared of coming to work. 
Is there anything we can do as a group to maybe pressure the company in giving people some paid time off or maybe some hazard pay for coming in? We all make minimum wage but it doesn't feel worth risking our health and safety and those around us just so people can have fast food instead of cooking.

 To Doctor or not to doctor? For Pete’s sake I can’t find any clear answers about whether to go to the doctor or not. Got a cough and fevery/achiness feeling last night after work. No fever. Was in Phoenix for a week and back in Van for last week. Don’t have a compromised immune system or severe symptoms but not sure if I’m supposed to go to a clinic which I’m sure are all slammed. Should I just shelter in place or hit the clinic? If the former for how long (presuming I don’t worsen or recover, that is). Assuming I start feeling better how long should I avoid the office and work from home? 

Been waiting on hold on the health line for an hour don’t think I’m gonna get through.

Thanks all.

 Emergency care benefits, part time workers? Anybody have any idea how the emergency care benefit is going to work? 

Are part time workers such as students elligible? Is it going to be a fixed amount of money?
It's so weird because i just found myself a new job as a cashier to make ends meet during the crisis, also while being super unconfortable with working in a grocery store right now. I was laid off of my part time job temporarily.. It just sounds odd to me that i could suddenly get $2000 /month when it's more than what i would usually make as a part time worker.

Some of my friends were barely even working before the covid crisis and are saying they're going to apply and it just sounds unfair to me that they would get this money while i struggle to make ends meet in a grocery store? Idk.

Or do you think it's going to work like EI? Are students elligible to EI?

 Cleaning surgical masks So the US government is finally coming around and maybe recommending everyone wearing masks when outside. Successful governments that have the epidemic in control, especially in Asia, have been recommending this all along. So I got my hands on a few, but they are still in such short supply. I’m not in any situation where I’m around sick people like a hospital where their masks are for sure contaminated but I do work in a close space with people and I’m essential so I have to go. I also go shopping for the family. I am in my 30s and not immune compromised. So I’m asking about cleaning facemask.

I was going to dunk them in soapy water, let them stay for a bit and the. Gently wash them off. Would this work to mostly clean off the masks? Would this cleaning reducing the effectiveness of the mask by causing small micro tears? Wandering if cleaning the mask since no new ones are in stores is better than nothing?

 ELI5: What's the hold up on provincial adoption of the Covid tracing app? Despite issues with compatibility with older hardware, I believe that this technology can offer a benefit with minimal privacy risks.

[Grumbling]( from the Quebec opposition politicians talking about technology is frustrating to hear, especially when it seems that they aren't able to compare the privacy implications of using an app like Waze.
 &gt; Rizqy added that she wouldn't download a tracing app if it was available in Quebec. "You're speaking to a woman who never downloaded the Waze [traffic] app," she told reporters in Quebec City.

Are there other bases for resistance to implementing the app? Why has only Ontario jumped on board so far? September and the return of school and a possible substantial [fall peak]( is just around the corner.

 Covid Alert App: Deanonymising Question Attention techies:

I have the Covid Alert app, and for the most part, I don't have any privacy concerns (I mean, there are more concerning apps than Covid Alert, with regards to privacy). But I did read [this article]( and have some questions about it:

&gt;To break this down, if you have Bluetooth turned on, your phone will broadcast its MAC address, as well as other device information, alongside the payload. A MAC address is a unique identifier used by networking devices, and is physically set in the Bluetooth chip in your phone. However, the app that uses Bluetooth technology can seek to anonymise the identity of the phone by only storing a UUID instead of the MAC address.  
&gt;  
&gt;To further try and obscure a single phone over time, the UUIDs broadcasted by the app may be regularly regenerated. i.e. you won't always have the same one. In order to keep track of the changes whilst still being able to tie them to an individual device, these UUIDs are either generated centrally — pushed down by the app's central server to your phone — or are generated on the device itself, and registered with the app.  
&gt;  
&gt;This doesn't, of course, stop the people operating the app (in this case a Government) — who have the database linking UUIDs to phone numbers — from deanonymising individuals. Indeed, they may consider this a feature rather than a bug, but it's important to think of the scale involved.

Is it possible the government could deanonymise a specific UUID? The article is from March 31, so I'm not sure if it's outdated, and the Canadian covid app is different than what is described in the article. [I read a breakdown]( of what's in the app by a rooted Android user, and it's also [completely open source]( which means the code can be combed through by anyone. But (of course), I have some tinfoilers that I am debating with who are claiming that the government will use it to track people. So I just want to put this to rest and find out if the government indeed could deanonymise bluetooth devices; if Covid Alert links the UUID's to phone numbers somehow.

 Part time work and CERB Hello friends.  


I have a question, and I'm hoping that somebody here would know the answer already.  
I am currently working for an "essential service" in Alberta but as I am a part timer I am only receiving 4 hours a week down from my minimum agreed 20 hours.  


I am trying to figure out how I would go about applying for the CERB as my work is not able to give me 20 hours a week.  


As far as I know, if one of these two ideas work then I would be eligible for CERB.  
1. Ask for my work to cut my hours down to 0, but retain me as I would like to work for them again when they are able to give me 20 hours.  


2. Ask for my work to lay me off, so that I can claim the CERB come April 6  


Thank you for your help &lt;3

 Boss making me work back at office. I have been working from home for the last few weeks. Everything has seemed to be fine and I am still getting the same amount, or more, work done. My boss now feels that having some of us return to the office to work will help keep our shop having more work to do. I have been back a few days since working from home to measure some of the stuff I was required to draw so we can remake the parts.

There is very little being done on site to keep us safe. Most people are not obeying social distancing in the shop and there is no PPE provided for us.  We have been deemed essential since we manufacture and install equipment for the agricultural industry.

Is there anything I can do to keep working from home. Also he is not having all the office staff come back only a couple of us for what seems like no real reason. He sent me an e-mail to inform me of this change today (Thursday April 9) and he expects me back Monday morning.

 Job still gives us hours even if we’re closed to customers but refuses to pay us if we decide not to come in.... Title pretty much says it all. I work at huge internationally known retail company that decided to close it’s stores to the public (except  online order pickup) but decided to still honour our schedule for the next couple of weeks. We will be doing some cleaning, etc. That seems like a good deal but I will still be around my coworkers and I fear getting the virus and transmitting it to my old father who lives with me. They give us the option to not come in but they won’t pay us ( I don’t have sick days yet). With the new budget and financial relief program from the Federal gov, I could technically stay home and get paid while keeping everyone around me safe. But I feel like they got us trapped with their agreement. I can’t go on EI because they still give us hours and haven’t laid us off, and if I decide not to attend they won’t pay me. What do you people think about this? I’m talking about a huge multinational company so I’m very much confused if they are doing this so we can keep getting paid or because they want to still run their business and make money.

 Traveling by car from Ontario to Vancouver Hi all, hoping someone may be able to help me, but I’m moving to Vancouver from Ontario area for work and will be driving across the country in my car as I need a car for work. 

As far as I can tell I am able to cross all the provincial borders if it is essential, which it will be. I intend to have my work write a letter that I can print confirming I am traveling / moving for work. My only concern is Manitoba as it seems to be the only province with a mandate to self isolate for 14 says upon arrival, however I will not be staying in Manitoba. I intend to drive straight through on the same day. 

Looking for any tips anyone can provide about route, accessibility, towns to stay in at night etc. Or if anyone knows what government website or contact info may be best to reach out to for confirmation I can for sure travel. 

Thank you in advance!

 I live with my grandparents and work at a grocery store. If I stay home will I qualify for the CERB? I worked at a restaurant that did not pay me correctly and then refused to fix it. So I quit and filed a claim with the labour board. The next day the NBA was cancelled, the NHL, almost every big event. I started freaking out that I wouldn't get a job so I applied at a grocery store. They hired me the next day and after my first day I started reading more into coronavirus. I live with my grandparents who are both over 70 and one of which had cancer last year. Also my wife works with high risk medically fragile clients.

I am now worried about bringing the virus home. I don't know if I should self isolate or just try to do my best to sanitize and wash my hands and not touch my face and not get too close to my grandparents. I feel stupid for leaving right after starting and like I should have thought of this all before applying but the fact is I didn't and I can't go back in time so now I'm not sure what to do. If I quit I won't get hired back in the future and it's a decent job. But I don't want to bring something home. I also don't know if I will qualify for the CERB or not.

Any help or advice appreciated. What would you do in this situation?
