 Ontario still waiting on feared Covid-19 surge.."That's a Surprise" [Report](

“In my centre, we have still a lot of empty beds in the ICU,” said D’Aragon Thursday. “That is a surprise. We changed all our schedules, our ICU schedules three weeks ago, to be on call. We cancelled all the teaching classes, all other administrative activities … So far, today, I’m at home. It’s not what we expected.”

 Self-innoculation with surgical and non-medical masks? It seems like something that our top doctors keep saying, and on a smaller scale, my company (retail store focusing on pharmacy, stores in most of Western Canada) keeps saying retail workers don't need surgical masks, if someone wants to wear a homemade mask go ahead but remember the risk of self-innoculation - aka rubbing virus with your own hands into the outside of the "mask" and then inhaling it.

The way they've been talking about it it seems like the risk of self-innoculation if even higher than not wearing a mask at all. Now that's been seen as an excuse to not recommend buying of medical masks, and something our leaders have mislead us with. 

What's the actual science behind this? Is risk actually higher than not wearing a face covering?
