 COVID-19 disease / SARS-CoV-2 infection / Coronavirus infection: Timeline of Symptoms, What to Do, When to Get Tested, When to Visit Hospital and When to Start Normal Activities **I. COMMON SYMPTOMS of COVID-19** (you might have one or more of these)

**I.A. Symptoms in MILD CASES** \- If you have only these, then you DO NOT need hospitalisation

1. Gastrointestinal symptoms - diarrhoea
2. Loss of sense of smell
3. Loss of taste
4. Mild fever
5. Cough
6. Tiredness
7. Body ache
8. Runny nose
9. Sore throat
10. Nasal congestion
11. Red eye (whites of eye become red)
12. Headache

**I.B. Additionals Symptoms that are present ONLY in SERIOUS CASES** \- If you have any of these then you NEED hospitalisation WARNING: These symptoms indicate that you might need to be hospitalised immediately. You MUST visit the nearest hospital WITHOUT DELAY as soon as you experience any of these symptoms.

1. High fever
2. Continuous cough
3. Difficulty breathing
4. Mental disorientation or confusion
5. Coughing up blood

**II. DISEASE PRESENTATION** (you can be Asymptomatic, that is not have any symptoms or Symptomatic, that is have one or more symptoms)

**II.A. ASYMPTOMATIC CASES**

People who do not exhibit any symptoms and don't feel unwell even after being infected.

Different studies show that the proportion of asymptomatic cases may be somewhere between 25 % to 50%

What to do: All those who do not have any symptoms should take the following precautions

1. Self-isolate - stay at home and go out only when urgently needed to buy essential supplies.
2. Wear masks - always wear a mask while going out. In case N95 and surgical masks are not available, then make masks at home from household materials. Instructional videos for DIY masks are easily available online. Homemade masks are also at least 50% as effective as surgical masks and their efficacy can go up to that of surgical masks by using the right design and materials. In case you have vulnerable people staying at home then those going outside should also wear masks inside the house. Before using masks, learn how to use them properly. Instructional videos are easily available online. Do not use masks with vents because if you are infected then they do not provide any protection to others.
3. Practice good hand hygiene - Do not touch your mouth, nose, or eyes before washing or sanitizing your hand. Hands should be washed at least for 20 seconds. Instructional videos for proper hand washing can be easily found online. As much as possible avoid touching surfaces when you go out. Use hands sanitizers liberally to sanitize your hand after you touch any surface outside.
4. Practice physical/social distancing -  Try to stay at least six feet away from others when you go out.
5. Do not worry - Worrying will lead to stress and lower your immunity. Take all the precautions possible and it will minimise your chances of getting infected by as much as 90%.

**II.B. SYMPTOMATIC CASES**

People who exhibit one or more symptoms following infection.

**II.B.1. MILD DISEASE**: About 95% of symptomatic cases experience a MILD disease. They experience a mild FLU like condition and DO NOT need hospitalization. You will have one or more of the symptoms listed under "IA. Symptoms in MILD CASES" mentioned above.

DAY 1-6: You will have one or more of the symptoms listed under "I.A. Symptoms in MILD CASES" (above). DAY 7: You will either start feeling better DAY 8: Feeling better - You need not worry. Your body is successfully controlling the virus. DAY 9 Onwards: Fully recovered - Your body has successfully controlled the virus. A dry cough might persist for as many as 14 days after full recovery.

DAYS 1-10 AFTER FULL RECOVERY: You may continue to SHED the virus for as long as 08 DAYS after full recovery. Therefore, continue to follow all precautions as if you are still infected BOTH inside the house and while going outside for AT LEAST another 10 DAYS after becoming all right. DAY 11 ONWARDS AFTER FULL RECOVERY: You can return to your normal activities.

IMMUNITY: All fully recovered cases become immune to the infection and remain so for a long period of time (for months - although information about how long immunity lasts is still lacking because it is a newly emerging disease so adequate data is not available). Fully recovered cases can go out and HELP run essential services.

**II.B.2. SERIOUS DISEASE**: About 5% of symptomatic cases will experience a SERIOUS disease. These cases WILL need hospital care.

DAY 1-6: You will have one or more of the symptoms listed under "I.A. Symptoms in MILD CASES" (above). DAY 1-6: You may also start expereincing one or more of the symptoms listed under "I.B. Symptoms in SERIOUS CASES" (above). IF YOU HAVE ANY OF THESE SYMPTOMS THEN YOU SHOULD REPORT TO A HOSPITAL IMMEDIATELY.

DAY 7 Onwards: If you had only mild symptoms earlier, you migh start feeling worse or start experiencing one of the symptoms of the serious cases - You should IMMEDIATELY go to the nearest hospital to be tested.

**III. REQUIREMENT OF HEALTHCARE FACILITIES**

95% of those infected need 2 weeks to recover without any medicine; 5% of those infected need hospitalisation; 2% of those infected need ICU care; and 1% of those infected need ventilator support.

 Mild symptoms, labored breathing, stuck at home with no answers I had a mild fever Sunday and Monday with labored breathing, and my husband had the same symptoms a couple days after me. I got the flu shot this year so (unless the flu shot is terrible) I can rule out a seasonal flu. While most of my symptoms are gone, I'm still having labored breathing today and a lot of exhaustion. I didn't want to believe it was the coronavirus but my partner and I are starting to think we might have it, because of the breathing. Neither of us have asthma or any prior breathing issues. We're both in our 30's. Opinions? Is anyone else experiencing mild symptoms of covid and are stuck in limbo wondering if it's true or not?

We're definitely too mild to get tested but we are still quarantining, of course.

 What "mild" means You often hear "80% of cases are mild", but what does that mean? How sick will you be if you have a mild case of COVID-19?

Please correct me if I'm wrong, but from what I can tell, it comes from this report from China: [

&gt;Among confirmed cases, most were aged 30–79 years (86.6%), diagnosed in Hubei (74.7%), and considered **mild (80.9%)**.

How do they define mild?

&gt;The severity of symptoms variable was categorized as mild, severe, or critical. **Mild included non-pneumonia and mild pneumonia cases.** Severe was characterized by dyspnea, respiratory frequency ≥30/minute, blood oxygen saturation ≤93%, PaO2/FiO2 ratio &lt;300, and/or lung infiltrates &gt;50% within 24–48 hours. Critical cases were those that exhibited respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure.

Now, I can't speak for you, but for me, I have never had an acute condition on the level of mild pneumonia. So, **I could have a "mild" case of COVID-19 and yet be the sickest I've been in my entire life**. I believe this is probably true for a lot of people.

Is this reason to panic, no, you become very sick but you get through it. It's not a death sentence (like the disease in Contagion, for example). But it is a reason to take COVID-19 seriously and not just wave it away like it's nothing.
