 Small business owner’s struggling with staff applying for CERB? Any small business owners here? Anyone’s struggling with staff not wanting to work but demand to apply for CERB? 

I have a small cafe and 80% my staff has voluntarily quit working during the pandemic - which I totally respect their decision. We have reduced hours with strict sanitizing procedures and we provide masks and gloves for staff so we are doing everything we can to provide safe environment for customers and staff. Also I’ve given staff who are working now a raise $3 dollars per hour plus bonus (if we get the 75% wage subsidy) we are quite open with it. 

What bothers me the most if a lot of my staff are bragging about receiving the CERB money even without ROE and is telling everyone that how easy it is and they don’t need anything and now I’m losing my remaining staff who were willing to work. I’m frustrated at people who abuse the government aids which is designed for people who need. The loose policy now really creates obstacles for small business to continue operating during the difficult time. I’ve told people that they won’t qualify and will have to pay back but it seems that paying back later isn’t a big deal at all as they only focus on free money now. 

I wish the government could have a better screening system so people can’t abuse the privilege they are given.  Any other business owners out there have the same feeling as me? I’m feeling stressed and defeated.

 Panic Buying in South Western Ontario (not GTA) I've been slowly stocking up on food for weeks as things went on sale. Today I went into my local Sobeys for some cream, and I've never seen it that busy. It was worse than Christmas Eve.

I guess closing the schools has made everyone suddenly realize how real this is. For the first time since this all began, I no longer wonder if I'm just going crazy for preparing as much as I have.

Stay safe everyone.

 How to apply for benefits Trudeau promised yesterday? My husband and I own a small brick and mortar in a tourist town. The town relies on a lot of Americans and Europeans in the summer months. There's about 50 small businesses just like ours around town and things are starting to look pretty grim here for tourist season.

This week was supposed to mark the beginning of that tourist season but I've already seen a huge drop off in sales since the beginning of March. This is coming after our first down season, which we prepared for and saved up to get us through but now that money is running out. 

Our eggs are not all in one basket, of course, but the other job my husband was to get paid for in April has also suffered delays with the government (through simple bureaucracy at first and now because of the virus)

We also had a family emergency this winter that dipped into our personal savings even more than we expected.

Needless to say this is a perfect storm for us financially. Does anyone know how we can we get ahead of the curve for when shit hits the fan here in Canada and we go on lockdown too? 

I realize this probably makes us sound like we've made bad business decisions, but please understand we are young and only 8 months into our first year as a small business. Our first summer was very successful and we were looking forward to this summer since we could hit the ground running. We planned for a lot of things, including the worst case scenario of zero business over the winter months, but we didn't plan for a pandemic. 
 

Does anyone here know what can we do? I checked the CRA but it doesn't say anything about what Trudeau said yesterday. It even says you have to wait 12 months after registering before you can apply for special assistance EI. When I call them I get disconnected after being on hold for over an hour. I'm at a loss on what to do here.

This is a shot in the dark but I'm hoping someone can point us in the right direction?

 Flying Canada to Germany - Looking for Advice Hello all.  I'm new to this subreddit so I'm not entirely sure how it works.  Apologies if this is out of place.

My long-term girlfriend had been living in Canada with me for 2 years (she's now a permanent resident) when COVID came around.   She lost her job back in April and decided to travel home to Germany, and has been there ever since.  Work has prevented me from going to see her, but now I have my employer's blessing to take a month off for a trip.  

Our plan was for me to go for Christmas and New Year's, then come back to Canada in early January.  But obviously the COVID situation has only been getting worse world-wide in the past few weeks/months, and it feels less reasonable than ever to take any risks right now.

I've been taking the situation very seriously all year.  I work from home and barely leave the house, wear a mask when I do, etc.  It feels like a total abandonment of my principles to fly right now, and all advisories clearly state that non-essential travel is a bad idea.

So it feels stupid to even ask this, but...  how safe ARE flights at the moment?  There is very little information out there because the government obviously does not wish to provide reassurance for anyone considering air travel.  If they did, they'd have a flood of fully booked flights on their hands again.  

I am just wondering whether there are statistics available anywhere as to how commonly COVID is contracted during flights, and whether or not taking all precautions can mitigate risk effectively.

 The Story Between Humans, Animals, Nature, Life In The New Corona Virus NCOV Event **The Story Between Humans, Animals, Nature, Life In The New Corona Virus NCOV Event**

If you are looking for another view and want to understand more about what exactly going at the moment on planet Earth during the NCOV event, then this is a story you should read.

From the ancient times, humans are the hunters and going to hunt all kind of animals in the wild forest. But most of that animals are the invisible one, so there is no big deal for them.

And by nature, there are a lot of new clans, new groups and including the authority was setup for “more productive”.

Suddenly one day, the invisible beast like a lion appear but this is a legendary lion have wings and can fly.

The authorities who are only stay at home in the city do not know exactly what is going on.

Some hunters tell them they are the dangerous just like a lion, some say they are just the cat, and a hidden legendary hunter say they are the unstoppable beast from ancient textbox.

The authority know the dangerous of that new animals, but instead of telling the truth to the people, they are keep telling the hunter that “they are just a big cat, not a big deal”.

After hearing that message from the authorities, many hunters still keep doing what they are doing everyday without any fear or any prepare. The time pass and many many hunters passed away mysterious.

And now the authorities instead of asking all the hunters to seek real information, they only ask the “scout” group called the scientist who their jobs is just using microscope, camera to capture the actions. Many governments are refuse to talk any theory about that legendary beast unless you have photo or videos like the scientist.

Ask yourself simple question: if you think hunters or any scientist can easily using camera to record that beast in details, then you are an absolutely idiots !!!

And those idiots are the government &amp; authorities are controlling you guys in this NCOV battle.

They are having no clue what is going on, they only want to enslave the people and keep the regime.

Instead of seeking new information from all people, they only rely on the “media, scout, scientist”.

For you know that the science is only for kids and stupid people. They are no much different than the media, they only describe and telling what was happened.  
 

What people need now is the solution, the way to solve the NCOV problem, they do not need some stupid statistics or image/video. The governments better wake up before too late.

**It is very easy to solve the problems if you seek help from all entities either online or offline. Just give a chance for whoever claim able to handle to problems, instead of gambling on only the “science”.**

What is the winning condition in this battle with the new corona virus NCOV, can any so called world leaders or any secret societies, elders can answer?

No, because they have no clue, just look at their actions.

People need a real leader who can lead them through this chaos, they do not need a “gambler, politician, businessman” who do not sure whether or not can solve this problem.  
 You will have more chance to survive if you follow and listen to any entity who claim have cure &amp; solution for the problems than the “not sure” one.

I am the legendary hunter who know that legendary beast and the forest map very well. But because almost nobody listen to me, then I still keep the best and waiting the right opportunity to reveal it.

Best Regard,  
 **The Savior**

 Coronavirus outbreak: Trudeau to announce Canada/U.S. border closure, Morneau on economic aid | LIVE 
++++++++++
 My credit is maxed, and rent is $1500 now. I will probably need to work at the hospital to fix this... I have been out of work for 5 months due to injured hands. I am almost healed enough to go back to work but the clinics I am working in are now closed (I do all the same stuff a physio does basically, I am an RMT). I think working at the hospital is the most natural continuation. I suspect they will be nice to me if I get sick for helping them and take good care of me probably as there will be no questions whether I am an asset. Edit: I am 25

I am self-employed. I fear the government will forget about contractual workers and give us nothing. They have given benefits to those in quarantine with the disease...great. What about all the rest of us? Isn't the point to keep non-sick people away from work, so that 'nobody has to worry about rent'? I hope something is coming, or people will just have to keep working and it defeats the whole purpose of social distancing ffs. They keep talking about buffing the hospitals, but so far they seem to be missing that they won't have to do that as much if they enable (pay) people to stay at home and REMOVE incentive to go out (close nightlife/bars/cafes/restaurants). I am sure they will not help us until they are really eager to cut the new case rates, and it will be too late then. They are probably hoping that many of us will be able to skate along without getting evicted for a few months with no income. So what, because I can't work from home I will be homeless then? I don't know what I expect from this government to fix that, if anything. They must understand that if people are evicted left and right, this is a way bigger issue all of a sudden, or so I hope...talk about an actual apocalypse.

Nervous personally about situations where this outbreak lasts longer than 4/5 months in Canada (it will, but seems like the spike of daily new cases could very well be in decline or at least plateau by then IMHO). The real miracle will be if 3mo from now we are in decline like China, but I have real suspicion that attempts to reduce hospital load will draw this whole thing out close to 2x longer as many will only delay their sickness by trying to evade the disease and isolating. I think it all depends how fast people change their behavior. It *seems* from other countries with fast reaction, once society gears itself towards preventing/isolating spread, the hospital load does go downwards and it's a better outcome for everyone. But if my clinics are closed for 4/5 months, I am fucked if I don't work at the hospital now aren't I...
++++++++++
 A couple easy things to improve. I am overall happy with the response in Canada, it is a little late and not as tight as I might have hoped, but it could be a lot worse.  But there are a couple of things that I feel are not made very clear or are easy fixes:

-If you are coming in from outside of Canada you should be in strict self-isolation immediately.  I don't think this is made abundantly clear.
-I have seen several articles that downplays the ability for an asymptomatic person to spread the illness.  First of all I believe this information may be false, and second it gives people too muh confidence to carry on with their daily business.
-Grocery stores have seniors hours in the morning which seems to draw crowds of them in a small area at the same time.  I fear this is not a wise choice.  The message instead should be to STAY HOME.

With many Canadians (apparently there are 3 million Canadians abroad now) returning home, including snow birds who are then going to special grocery hours with their peers, we need to be as tight as possible.
++++++++++
 Question for fellow people that work in regulated health professions during COVID I'm sure most of you have rules and protocols set in place at your clinics, and I had a few questions for how you handle certain situations.

At the office I work at we make it really clear : You MUST wear a mask, you must come ALONE to your appointment (unless you absolutely need a caregiver or 1 parent) \*\*don't get me started on people who try to bring their spouse, "just because"\*\*, wait outside until someone gets you, and **NO WALK INS- If you do not have a scheduled appointment you are not authorized to come in and must call from outside the clinic for assistance.** 

The last one especially peeves me when people don't listen to it.

We have these rules in place to protect our patients and staff. And because we have to screen and temperature check every person that walks in. You could be walking in off the street while another patient is leaving, causing you to bump into one another. Also, because you didn't call ahead, I wasn't able to screen you before you came in- I don't know where you've just been, who you've had contact with, if you've gone outside the province recently or are awaiting COVID results, etc. etc.

Why is this hard to follow? Any other people out there in the health care industry that can relate?

 Possibly exposed, Management won't shut us down. My (non essential) workplace is dropping the ball. 

On Thursday, we were gathered together and told to go home and self isolate for the rest of the week &amp; weekend due to possible exposure (coworker showing symptoms after tertiary contact). If we don't have symptoms, we are expected to be back on Monday. 

Since then there has been no communication and I don't expect any before I'm due to report back. The only details I have are hear-say from coworker's.

If there really was an exposure, shouldn't we all be required to quarantine for 14 days? Is there any higher authority I can get into contact with about this? 

I understand my managers are people too and are fallible, I just want us all to take the proper precautions. 

Stay safe folks.

 The Government seems to have forgotten people with Disabilities at all levels. Now I realize normally programs like #ODSP are province level, but the point still stands we been forgotten. Living around 50% under the poverty line and a crisis like this hitting has been very very scary for us. 

All the Social Groups are blowing up quite worried, wondering if they will get extra assistance, stock running out, prices too high, etc.

Lot of people depend on the day after day social programs as well like libraries. Most of us don't own TV, many don't even have the Internet, and a heck of a lot of us can't pay for Cell phones, etc.

It's really been hard for everyone and I think were lucky (in our home). I'm full time caregiver for my spouse and what you call an able body. So I'm able to keep looking after her, but financially we been ruins since her disability and will be in ruins after. 

I guess the point is I wish the Media and Governments would spend a tad more effort remember that we exist. I see so many people crying bloody murder on missing out a week pay and I understand people live paycheck to paycheck. But imagine getting a little under $500 for shelter allowance a month for a single person.

Ugh sorry I just needed to vent a bit. I'm so worried about my brothers and sisters around Canada who don't have much of a voice.

 Just a friendly reminder to limit the number of people you go grocery shopping with (ideally, only one person) Of course there’s situations when going alone isn’t possible and that’s understandable, but when you’re a family of 4 with teenage children in line to get into costco, that’s not cool. Not only does that increase the risk of spreading/contracting, but as many stores limit the number of customers allowed in the building, you’re taking away spots that could help the line move faster. Stay safe out there :)

 Does anyone think they got the coronavirus weeks ago? It's very likely I'm projecting here but I've read people's descriptions of what the coronavirus feels like, and it's identical to what myself and two other people in my home got back in mid-February.

A sore throat and scratchy feeling at the top of my lungs that turned into a persistent dry cough, I maybe had a bit of a fever but very minor if so. I felt EXHAUSTED. I would be overcome with fatigue and tiredness. One of the other people in my home got very minor symptoms and they went away after a few days. The other got more severe symptoms than me and is a smoker. She developed a more severe cough and it lingered for a couple of weeks.

I get a cold on average about once a year,  but what I got back in february was unlike anything I've caught in my adult life (I'm 35).

The doctor who treated the first coronavirus patient in the US thinks it was circulating for weeks before it was first diagnosed there in January ( 

There is also a study out of Washington state where genetic sequencing shows it had been circulating in the state for weeks before the first cases were confirmed (

I know without actual testing theres no way to be positive, but does anyone think they may have already caught it weeks before the lockdowns and closures began?

 Question - what's the rule on meeting up with someone indoors in Ontario? Safe / allowed if 2 metres apart, or is it only if they are part of your 'social bubble'? I'm not sure I'm confused because the most up to date rules I've found say that the max number of people indoors for a gathering is currently 50, but it also mentions sticking with your social group of 10 people. I'm a bit confused.

So let's say me and 4 friends of mine want to meet at my house - would we have to hang out outdoors or would we be able to hang out indoors if we were all 2 metres apart from each other? If so, would we have to wear masks? It's not a big deal to us anyway and we'll probably hang out outdoors just to be on the safe side(our city hasn't had a covid case for a hot while but hey let's not risk it) but I want to understand the regulations.

Sorry if it's a dumb question, I've just been getting a lot of conflicting information from friends and family and I'm getting confused by the stage 3 guidelines, though I imagine I'm just being dumb and it's pretty clear there haha.

 Has the Pandemic , changed our society? What a difference a couple months make.

Prior to that we were living our life accordingly, we had no choice. We were conditioned,  our societal behaviour ingrained in us from birth. A working society where the majority of the workers were living from pay cheque to pay cheque in order to keep the bills paid, a roof over thier heads, and food on the table. Accumulation of stuff equated to wealth. 

That's the way its supposed to be. It keeps the capitalistic society running like a fine tuned engine. We are simply the grease to the machine.  Money is the fuel. Eventually social anxiety and hopelessness is the end result. Another by - product looks like it could be image unconsciousness. Just check out the vanity posts. 
Markets tank, socialism creeps in to muddy the grease. Or to enhance its performance depending on how you see it. This is usually when peak democratic capitalist society comes to a grinding halt.

Remember that last sentence.

This was the trajectory society was on. Like it or not. Just not knowing how to enact that change. It had to get better,  right?
Socialism scares the  hell out of Democratic Capitalism.

Then the Pandemic arrived. Things changed.

In a few short months, weeks even, the Pandemic  modified our social behavior patterns like nothing we have ever experienced before. 200 years of societal behaviour evolution, altered beyond recognition in days. On a global scale. A behaviour that goes against all of our standard norms; social interaction, large gathering places, world travel, and physical contact that up until now humanity belived it had to have to survive.

We may have been wrong in making that assumption. I really hope so.

The Pandemic erased all of that. We are now forced into isolation, no physical contact, no large gatherings, no walking the dog, or talking to the neighbor over the fence. This goes against everything we are. Seemingly an overnight 180 degree turn in the expectation of our societies behaviour. Literally days.

It got worse.

World wide death, uncertainty, panic, closure of  borders, schools and non essential businesses, travel bans,  overwhelmed Medicare systems, and financial market chaos. Currency devalues as its the perfect delivery system for a Pandemic. Touch it and it could kill you. Online businesses soar. Our infrastructure was not designed for this. 

As a result we now see large progressive cities becoming ghost towns. Martial Law is right around the corner. This makes it harder to spend our hard earned cash. Remember that is the only way capitalism survives.  No fuel for the machine.The Pandemic is not just effecting our social behaviour. It is threatening the capitalism model as we know it. This is usually when the peak democratic capitalist society comes to a grinding halt. Sound familiar.

Governments cant stop a Pandemic, history shows us this.

Governments first response is to soothe anxiety and avoid panic of the people.  Inevitably changing tactics only when they realize that the Pandemic is spreading regardless of their efforts. Then they throw money at it. Too little too late. Again, history has many illustrations of this. 

Good News. 

There was a slow shift to get away from the normal rat race anyway. Our existing model wasn't sustainable.  Younger generations had that figured out long ago. Social media was already becoming the communication system of choice, alowing us to communicate in real time and without  borders. Online shopping, home delivery services, and the ability to work from home and avoid the 5 day a week standard procedure. The overwhelming desire for healthcare which the Pandemic has proven is woefully inadequate. This was going to be a slow process. It's hard to change overnight, and involves  painful job re-creation, and older societal generations must literally die off before the majority of the population can embrace it. Harsh for a free society.Great for a Pandemic.

This Pandemic is devestating, as a society, as a human race. I know I'm living it. Millions will die worldwide.

So, save your money or dont, invest your money or dont, sell your stuff or dont. It won't matter, this Pandemic may have not only triggered the end of the Peak capitalistic society model, it may have shown use what we can accomplish on the other side to make our society more livable.The society goes on. The sun is coming up tomorrow just like it did yesterday, and the day before.

For levity, look no further than Hollywood. At two quotes that are more appropriate now than they have ever been.

 I’m a barber in Toronto with a couple questions. Please help me understand. So I’m a barber in my own small shop. And I’ve been torn whether to keep my doors open or closed. I go by appointment, so there’s never a “crowd” in my waiting room. I wash my hand frequently and disinfect my tools after each customer. I believe I’m taking all the necessary precautions to help “flatten the curve”. 

But I’m a little nervous about contracting from a client and passing it to other clients. I opened today and felt uneasy the whole day. I did two elderly clients in the morning and couldn’t help but think about them. I told my dad who is in his 70’s and works with me to stay home because I don’t even want him to be potentially exposed. 

Should I be closing? How long do I close for? 

Thanks

 How Long Do You Imagine We Will Be Dealing With This? I mean, basically the title. I'm aware that the virus will likely be around for quite some time, but for the sake of the economy and people's livelihood we can't be banning international travel and large gatherings for more than a few months. It's unrealistic.

On a personal note, I currently have a trip booked to Seattle that I very much want to go on in late May, and I am hoping to move to Japan in the fall. Do you think that this will affect either of those?

 Woman without self-isolating hugs my grandmother after traveling from Toronto Hello to anyone reading. I am living in St. Johns, NL. I need to know if there is anything I can do about this situation:

My grandma lives in a rural part of Newfoundland (around 900 population) where I would have thought she would be safe along with my grandfather from potentially getting the virus. Little did I know, she informed me today that on March 20th she went literally a minute up the road to get groceries for the week when she ran into someone she hadnt seen in a long time. This woman ran up to her and gave her a hug. My grandma told me she didn't push her off as she was just taken aback by the gesture. When I heard that I was livid. This woman who knew my grandma had just came back from Toronto the day before and obviously didn't self isolate. (March 19th). God knows where she had been, what she had already come in contact with. I'm just beyond myself. 

Now my grandma and grandpa are truly isolated now for two weeks and we have some folks there to bring them what they need. 

I want to know if there is any recommendations on what can be done about what happened? If this woman was carrying if there is any recourse of action. Was what she did illegal at the date of occurence? (March 19)

 I have concerns about my workplace in a public area. I feel like we are not taking the proper precautions to keep everyone safe and we are facing severe issues with staffing and positions. Our higher-ups appear to not be taking any action about these issues that we are aware of, where can I go to voice my concerns officially? This business appears to not be enforcing any of the regulations asides from placement of arrows on the floor, which are not being followed by customers and not being enforced. We have also not been instructed on what to do when this happens, as we are generally not supposed to talk to clientele.

I am aware this should be put under the Question flair but I am on mobile and it will not let me add more than one flair. I chose the appropriate flair for our local region to better pinpoint where I need to go.

 Canada has been doing a great job on containment, tracking people down, self quarantine and all. So thanks. thank you for being mostly on top of thing and being somewhat proactive and not denying the inevitable.

The quote " the chain is only as strong as it's weakest link" seems to fit well right now where Canada didn't really lose the ball on this... but we can't start controlling million of people coming in and out of the country from every country.

And well as it starts to break out in mutiple countries it will get to a point where it's pretty much impossible to fully contain it.


We had a co-worker come from China and I guess was contacted to do self quarantine which was great cause many people at work were starting to be worried about it. This was back in early/mid January so time has past.

But for the remaining provinces, it seems better to shut down hard and get it over with, rather than let it drag on and on and on. Then all they have to do is maintain things via mandatory and enforced quarantines for inbound travelers. Obviously exemptions are made for essential workers (who would need to be tested regularly as a precaution).

 I no longer feel safe at work So I work in a printing press in a specific city in Manitoba, where the infection rate is apparently among the highest in the country now, and I'm scared to be at work. Of the 5 of us who actually run the press, I am the only one who wears a mask all day, the head guy thinks this is all not a big deal and a government power play, and thinks the fines are stupid. Now thats manageable on its own, I guess, but here's the thing: I'm asthmatic, and have enough trouble breathing in winter normally, we print newspapers that go to several provinces, and apparently some strains of covid can live on paper for up to 5 days? On top of that, my wife works in the library, so even with their pickup only setup, if I get her sick, it circumvents their whole book quarantine process. On top of everything else, a business connected to our shop had a positive case, and that man actually shares our bathroom, I encountered him often, before I started masking up, though he always wore a mask when he came over. I didn't get infected but it contributes to my fear. What can I do here?

 I have not received initial cerb payment from early April due to possible system glitch I applied for CERB through Service Canada on April 8th (my birthday is in August) and have yet to receive a penny through this system. I have not received my first payment. I have also done all my reports for one month and even after that, i have not received a cent.

I was coming off EI, my last week being March 22nd and only getting paid for that one week. Last year I was constructively dismissed from my job in June and suffered ganging up, sexual and racial harassment and discrimination at work. I was interviewing fairly frequently up until the covid outbreak and applied to nearly 2000 jobs.

I have been trying to get through to Service Canada EI for weeks now, after calling the CERB info hotline twice and them not being able to do anything. I did the receive a call back option on the Service Canada site and just received my call over a week after I did that. The person I spoke to brought up my file, first told me they couldnt find my ROE, then once I logged into My Service Canada Account I was able to guide them in finding it. Then the agent told me I had applied for EI March 28th, which I did not. I explained this to her and she tried to fight with me and said "you clearly did". I mentioned it might be a system or computer glitch and she then proceeded to tell me Service Canada doesnt make glitches like that and that I would need to call EI. I then told her that the whole point i filled out request a call back was because I could not reach anyone on EI. Fri and today I have been able to even get into the que on the phone. I had been calling for a couple weeks, often spending 5-6 hours a day on speaker phone redialling. You get through the opening spiel which is at least 5 minutes long and type in your SIN number and access code and press 0 to speak to a human. After this a computerized voice comes on and says "sorry we cannot answer your call, please visit Canada.ca or call again later". This is not really helping all Canadians who qualify and need the help.

I explained this to this Service Canada employee and she said "too bad, thats what you have to do". I then said how is this "helping all Canadians in need like Trudeau said. I need to be able to eat and afford my rent and haven't had anything come in in over a month and did nothing wrong". Then the Service Canada worker said to me "how about all the people working at these phone lines, I feel sorrier for them than you. They have to constantly sift through these calls all day and listen to peoples problems".  She tried to make me feel bad. There is something seriously wrong with this.

 Keep your kids at home! Now, that schools are closed (at least for some of us), I hear that kids are planning to congregate at malls, rec centres, go to parties, and the like. I know many of us have to work, and this might be not a practical move for many. At least try to educate your kids about making wise decisions: washing hands frequently, social distancing, not sharing food etc. Public transport might not be the best idea right now as a recent study from China shows (a passenger got on 30 minutes after an infected passenger got out, and got infected. Passenger 4.5 m behind the infected passenger got infected). You can also encourage your kids to stay home by buying them more books and video games or something along those lines. Of course, many of you might be planning to travel on March Break anyway...

 We must socially shun anyone making unnecessary international trips I know someone who is flying to Europe in a month for PLEASURE.  I know is Canadians are polite, reserved people, but as the WHO says: it’s not them or our health care system that will defeat this virus.  It’s the people.

We need to socially support social distancing, proper hygiene, and proper preparations.  And we must tell those who aren’t doing these things that they are putting themselves and others at risk.  Sure, it will most likely not be fatal for you if you are young and healthy.  But you could transmit it to others who are at risk.  It is negligent to travel outside Canada right now unnecessarily.  Please do not support these people.  They are reckless and we should not be impartial towards this behaviour.

 A specific question on quarantine I’m flying into Canada from out of country, and I will be quarantining at a hotel for 14 days. I’ll arrive at my quarantine place at night (say around 8pm) on the first day. Does that mean I’m only allowed to leave after 8 pm two weeks later? Or is quarantine over once you reach the 14th day? 

I’m asking because my hotel reservation is exactly 14 days. If it is the case that I should stay until after 8pm on the 14th day, I’d have to leave the hotel at night which is kind of unfavourable for me. 

Does any sort of government body care about these timing specifics or am I being too neurotic about this? Thanks

 The Story Between Humans, Animals, Nature, Life In The New Corona Virus NCOV Event **The Story Between Humans, Animals, Nature, Life In The New Corona Virus NCOV Event**

If you are looking for another view and want to understand more about what exactly going at the moment on planet Earth during the NCOV event, then this is a story you should read.

From the ancient times, humans are the hunters and going to hunt all kind of animals in the wild forest. But most of that animals are the invisible one, so there is no big deal for them.

And by nature, there are a lot of new clans, new groups and including the authority was setup for “more productive”.

Suddenly one day, the invisible beast like a lion appear but this is a legendary lion have wings and can fly.

The authorities who are only stay at home in the city do not know exactly what is going on.

Some hunters tell them they are the dangerous just like a lion, some say they are just the cat, and a hidden legendary hunter say they are the unstoppable beast from ancient textbox.

The authority know the dangerous of that new animals, but instead of telling the truth to the people, they are keep telling the hunter that “they are just a big cat, not a big deal”.

After hearing that message from the authorities, many hunters still keep doing what they are doing everyday without any fear or any prepare. The time pass and many many hunters passed away mysterious.

And now the authorities instead of asking all the hunters to seek real information, they only ask the “scout” group called the scientist who their jobs is just using microscope, camera to capture the actions. Many governments are refuse to talk any theory about that legendary beast unless you have photo or videos like the scientist.

Ask yourself simple question: if you think hunters or any scientist can easily using camera to record that beast in details, then you are an absolutely idiots !!!

And those idiots are the government &amp; authorities are controlling you guys in this NCOV battle.

They are having no clue what is going on, they only want to enslave the people and keep the regime.

Instead of seeking new information from all people, they only rely on the “media, scout, scientist”.

For you know that the science is only for kids and stupid people. They are no much different than the media, they only describe and telling what was happened.  
 

What people need now is the solution, the way to solve the NCOV problem, they do not need some stupid statistics or image/video. The governments better wake up before too late.

**It is very easy to solve the problems if you seek help from all entities either online or offline. Just give a chance for whoever claim able to handle to problems, instead of gambling on only the “science”.**

What is the winning condition in this battle with the new corona virus NCOV, can any so called world leaders or any secret societies, elders can answer?

No, because they have no clue, just look at their actions.

People need a real leader who can lead them through this chaos, they do not need a “gambler, politician, businessman” who do not sure whether or not can solve this problem.  
 You will have more chance to survive if you follow and listen to any entity who claim have cure &amp; solution for the problems than the “not sure” one.

I am the legendary hunter who know that legendary beast and the forest map very well. But because almost nobody listen to me, then I still keep the best and waiting the right opportunity to reveal it.

Best Regard,  
 **The Savior**

 Any Canadians living in the US crossed the land border lately? What was your experience? Wondering if any Canadians who currently live in the US have crossed the border to visit family during covid? I'm aware of the discretionary travel ban, but it sounds like if you quarantine for 14 days it's ok to visit? or am I totally misinterpreting the rules here?

I was not considering this in the early days, but if the border restrictions are still in place another six months from now I may try to drive up then. I'm asking about the land border since I'm not  about to fly anytime soon.

Thanks!

 How long is it taking to get results where you live? Curious how this is varying across the country. Looking for stats for right now, or from the last 1-2 weeks. Currently I’m in Alberta, and they’re saying allow 7-10 days for results. Which I personally think is ridiculous.. if you’re in Alberta and have been swabbed recently, how long did it take to access your results? Other provinces weigh in on the times where you are. I wonder if they prioritize positive tests over negative ones, as far as sending out result notifications. 
Please keep this post constructive.

 Ontario University I am a second year student at the University of Guelph. I feel isolated in my worries as not very many of my friends are taking this as seriously as I am and I find that I am coming across as quite the doomer when I am usually the one to bring up this subject. I would like to know what other information has spread across other Ontario Universities/Colleges as well as those outside of Ontario. We haven't gotten much of an update besides a single email a little more than a week ago. The email didn't indicate much other than "we have a default plan we will enact if shit hits the fan". A lot of my day goes into wondering about what kind of measures will actually be taken. I am sure we will be left in the dark until their actual implementation to reduce the possible worrying of students and faculty. Any answers would be greatly appreciated! This is my first Reddit post and am loving the communities that revolve around this subject (wish this didn't have to be my first post on Reddit though).
