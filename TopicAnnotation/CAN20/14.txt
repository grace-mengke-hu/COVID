 I wish each district would disclose the number of cases under investigation. Iâ€™m in an area with no confirmed cases.  Life has slowed down a bit, but it is still busier than it should be.  If each health unit would disclose the number of cases under investigation in their jurisdiction it might encourage people to stay home.  Just a thought.

 Are we heading towards Panic ATM Cash Withdrawals ? The way things are looking with the Covid 19 and the Economy one cannot help but ask this question. Banks are going to be hit hard so it's understandable that people in the USA have already started to cause a shortage of 100 dollar bills by withdrawing money. Wonder if this kind of activity is eventually coming to Canada. I'm really curious to see the extent if things and wonder of everyone is just overreacting.

 Something isn't right here... I live in the Fraser Valley. A friend of mine in Chilliwack has two young kids and a wife. His kids and wife have come down with a cold or flu since school started this week. This is understandably concerning, so they called 811. They were told they aren't testing kids in Chilliwack, and that she shouldn't bother to come in and get tested either. I find this absolutely baffling that this isn't being taken seriously at all. Would explain how our numbers are staying so low. 
  What's worse is my friend explained to his boss what is going on at home, and they told him to keep coming in to work. Something is definitely wrong with this picture. Does anyone else have a similar story?

 Can anyone tell me what the issue is with testing? Why canâ€™t we test way more people? Is it an issue with supply? Not enough medical staff? Why canâ€™t we test 10k people a day like South Korea?

 We need to hold people accountable - Jillian Harris is telling people she won't stop traveling or shaking people's hands I feel like we need to compile a list of these people so they can be held accountable after this is over - either through public opinion or legally. Jillian Harris has started deleting the posts now, but this kind of thing is disgusting. People are telling her she can say what she wants, she's not a doctor, but she influences millions of Canadians. 

I would make a Google doc but I'm away from the PC. Will do later of no one else has.
