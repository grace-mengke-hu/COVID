 Airbnb asks government to bail out hosts in Canada due to Covid &amp;#x200B;

[

Is this really what Canada has come to?  Mega companies who never paid taxes and made life harder for Canadians now want us to bail  out their shady business practices. Socialism for the rich, hard austerity capitalism for the rest of us.

"Airbnb is asking the government to make employment benefits available to Airbnb hosts.

Airbnb also wants the government to defer sales taxes for short term rentals.

The platform also wants the government to defer income taxes for Airbnb hosts "

 Threat: Coronavirus or Global Recession Based on available data, in spite of mainstream media sources, it appears that Coronavirus is mild in the vast majority of cases, and affects specifically elderly people and those with underlying health issues. 

In any given flu season we all take common sense precautions to curb the rate of infection among the elderly and immune compromised. Social distancing, health alerts, and basic hygiene have been the norm for decades, and could be considered common sense. We all accept the collateral damage caused by flu pandemics. 

Does it really make sense to grind the global economy to a hault, and to then promise hundreds of billions in stimulus?

Is the nation not already in debt? Additionally, printing money devalues the savings of everyone. Interest rates are already supremely low. The government earns it's revenue through income tax and tax on goods and services. If the government grinds the economy to a hault, and is already in debt, cannot print money or lower interest rates, and is promising hundreds of billions of dollars to pop out of thin air... Does this not sound absurd?

I'm an economist, an investor, and I have a background in psychology. 

Please help me see where I'm incorrect.

 The question we need to be asking at next elections If nothing else this whole thing has brought to light just how deeply our officials are willing to bury their heads in the sand in response to a difficult global reality. 

When this all blows over, I expect we’ll see lots about how “at least we were better prepared than SARS” and “nobody could have predicted the impact” and a bunch of other self-congratulatory BS.

I think the question we need to be asking at the next elections, Federal, Provincial, Municipal, is:

&gt; It is mid-January 2020. Coronavirus cases are taking off in Wuhan. What is your government’s response?
