 The USA Could Be Disappeared Within The Next 12 Months, Only 2 Options Left **The USA Could Be Disappeared Within The Next 12 Months, Only 2 Options Left**

Fear monger from the East again just like the corona virus?

Corona virus is just a fake news with only politics purpose?

After corona virus touch down America land: Oh shit corona virus is not fake, it is real.

**The truth is now the America USA have only 2 options left on the table:**  
 1 is Death, no matter what they try and do by themselves.  
 2 is Live, only by seeking help from the savior Messiah.

**The option number 1:**  
 – People to work: corona virus will spread, no matter what they will going to do.  
 And the damage and the dangerous of this NCOV you guys already have witness with your own eyes, not just some words from others. -&gt; So they are going to die because of this legendary beast.  
 

– People stay at home: corona virus NCOV infected case will be reduced. Mental health, potential gun fight because of bored. And the most dangerous: what about super volcano Yellow Stone erupt because lack of CO2? -&gt; So they are going to die because of shock life effect, mental health and from super volcano eruption.

An idiot with thought know that too little CO2 is the cause of global warming. And throughout history, the Asia and Europe have already received something like Spanish flu and Tambora volcano eruption. The only continent have not yet receive the natural catastrophe is the America continent.

So it is very likely, the next one it the super volcano Yellowstone.

**The option number 2:**  
 The only way for them to live is seeking help from the savior Messiah.  
 I do not know why they are too stupid, do they even read the Bible yet?  
 

Only the savior Messiah can save them directly, not the God who have created the Earth can save them directly face to face, but “maybe” indirectly way.

I do not want to lie but you guys cannot verify me as the God like what you thinking in your mind.

For each people have their own meaning and own dictionary about God.

And I am not going to help them for free because law of karma.

I am not going to help the “controller, the rich” for free, I want them to die first if they do not wake up.

So if the USA government and patriot do not wake up and use soon to be worthless US Dollar, money and resources to seek help from the internet, from whoever claim able to handle the problems, then they are deserve to be disappeared.

And for American people: you guys better wake up, your government are gambling your life. The smart people do not take risk, but your government is just do not sure can handle the situation but keep going without warning from the savior Messiah.

If you guys think I am just a troll, then you better read many articles at theworld.data.blog from the start. Oh wait, many of them are with big ego and do not willing to accept the fact that there are some much smarter beings exist on Earth as well.

For the normal American people: If you guys cannot force your government listen to the savior Messiah, then get the hell out of the USA land as soon as possible to save your own life !!! Even stock foods is not worth now.

Only the savior Messiah can give you the right direction and handle this apocalypse situation.  
 

Best Regard,

 Visiting Canada from the US Hi, so my partner (we’re in an over 1 year committed relationship and we’ve met in person) lives in the states and I live in Canada. With the new border restriction exemptions we figured she could finally visit here, she’s close enough to drive and we’re fully able to quarantine. Obviously travelling right now is not a good idea, but we’re going to take every precaution, and I haven’t seen her since March. I fully recognize that this is selfish and unsafe, but we don’t know the next time we’d both have 2 weeks off to quarantine.

My issue is that I live in Ontario. Does anyone know if the new Ontario restrictions for travel will affect us? She’s travelling for a non-essential reason so I’m concerned she may be turned away at the border!

 Interprovincial travel over the holidays - Canada Are lots of people going home for the holidays? Do you think you’ll be able to return on time? Or is there a chance you might get stuck due to airports being shut down or banning of interprovincial travel.

What are people’s opinions?

 The 14 day quarantine... Unfortunately now that the unemployment benefits in the US have expired, I find myself having no choice but to move back home to Canada. Please don’t judge, this has been a hard year. 

My questions are this:

Iam getting an airbnb and will be quarantining the 14 days in a private room. Does a private room work or does the gov need you to rent the entire place (I plan to make sure I don’t interact with the owner or other guests)

Also, i have a connection flight from city A to city B where I will quarantine. I land in Canada in city A, iam allowed to continue in my connection flight to city B to quarantine or do you have to quarantine wherever you touched down in Canada. 

Please give real information that the government is using, not how you feel it should be done, I get most here would rather I don’t move back with my parents or atleast quarantine in the airport restroom for a month, I get that sentiment, unfortunately ill be homeless next month.

 Ontario's new Infectious Disease Emergency Leave. Do not go to work on Monday. If you work in a non-essential position, that is a position that:

1. adds no value to the public during a Global Pandemic. 
2. does not allow you to effectively self-isolate or social distance.
3. does not allow you to work from home 

You need to stop working. Do not go to work Monday. You are willfully endangering yourself and you are purposely endangering others during time of crisis. A lockdown is coming regardless, could very well be this week, but don't wait for Government action. Take action on your own and set an example. Personal ethics above all else. 

What do I need to know?

* On March 19, 2020 the Employment Standards Amendment Act (Infectious Disease Emergencies), 2020 came into effect, which added a new kind of leave: Infectious Disease Emergency Leave.

* These March 19, 2020 measures are retroactive to January 25, 2020, the date that the first presumptive COVID-19 case was confirmed in Ontario. They will remain in place until COVID-19 is defeated.

* Infectious Disease Emergency Leave provides job protection for employees unable to work for basically any reason related to COVID-19. 

* Individuals affected by COVID-19 coronavirus should therefore now take an Infectious Disease Emergency Leave from work, not a “Sick Leave”.

**Step 1: Advise your employer your are taking an Infectious Disease Emergency Leave.**

E-mail your employer that you have been impacted by COVID-19 and you will be immediately starting the Infectious Disease Emergency Leave. You have been impacted COVID-19 as you, the "employee", must care for one of the following individuals:

* The employee’s spouse.
* A parent, step-parent or foster parent of the employee or the employee’s spouse.
* A child, step-child or foster child of the employee or the employee’s spouse.
* A child who is under legal guardianship of the employee or the employee’s spouse.  
* A brother, step-brother, sister or step-sister of the employee.
* A grandparent, step-grandparent, grandchild or step-grandchild of the employee or the employee’s spouse.  
* A brother-in-law, step-brother-in-law, sister-in-law or step-sister-in-law of the employee.
* A son-in-law or daughter-in-law of the employee or the employee’s spouse.
* An uncle or aunt of the employee or the employee’s spouse.
* A nephew or niece of the employee or the employee’s spouse.
* The spouse of the employee’s grandchild, uncle, aunt, nephew or niece.
* A person who considers the employee to be like a family member, provided the prescribed conditions, if any, are met.
* Any individual prescribed as a family member for the purposes of this section.

**Step 2: Begin your Infectious Disease Emergency Leave.** 

* Stay home and do not physically go to work Monday. 
* You cannot be terminated for taking this leave. 
* Your employer cannot ask you for any sort of medical note or proof. 
* Your employer does not have to pay you during this leave (this is an unpaid, but job-protected leave). 
* Your employer does have to maintain your benefits during this leave. 
* The right of the employee to not come to work, and be on this leave, lasts for as long as the declared state of emergency (under section 7.0.1 of the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act) lasts.

**Step 3: Apply for Employment Insurance.**

* Your employer will automatically release an ROE (Record of Employment) to Services Canada. 
* Contact Services Canada to apply for EI Sickness Benefits. 
* Employment insurance sickness benefits provides employees 55% of their earnings up to a maximum of $573 a week.
* In applying for EI sickness benefits, employees are not required to get a medical certificate. 
* EI benefits could last up to 15 weeks. 

**Step 4: Self-Isolate and Socially Distance**

* Co-operate with your employer in the event they are able to facilitate some sort of work from home arrangement during the leave to allow you to return to work. 
* Maintain social distancing measures. 

**Step 5: Relax knowing that you morally took the right measure given the circumstances.**

 Need to Vent: Working in a hardware store and facing extreme anxiety I work at Canadian Tire and I been facing extreme anxiety when COVID-19 began.   Its gotten to the point I am having break downs before I ever use the train or bus, in fear of the risk during public transit.  Once I get to work I face the same breakdowns when serving people.  

I am a cashier and customer service representative.  I get paid minimum wage and been at this job for a few years now.  Recently our store hours have changed, we do not accept paper CT money (However, we still take cash if we cannot convict them the idea of using debit or credit) but we are still not taking the same measures as other Canadian tire stores.  For example, the next closest one was only allowing people inside in small numbers, while the rest waited outside with a 2m distance.  Our store has not given such measures at all, in fact the weekend at the cash front was so crowded and full of people it was very hazardous for a social distancing situation. People also do not listen when cashiers aske them to provide distance and there is no authority in the cash front to force these measures into place.

&amp;#x200B;

At first I thought it was corporate that made these choice, but seeing how other CT stores are taking further measures, but my location is not, makes me believe it the the owner/dealer making the choice to implement these changes or not.  The only reason I believe we do not take the same measures is because of greed.  They do not wanton refuse cash because they might not get that money and they do not want to control the amount of people entering at a time because it may reduce them people of people using products.  Additionally, we have no TP or hand sanitizer, the major of purchases is leisurely and non-essential goods.  Therefore, it more than likely contributing to the spread of COVID-19 and enabling non-essessitonal shopping behaviours.

Today when I heard that they were closing non-essential stores I was so happy.  I need the money, but honestly at this point I would take EI just to have peace of mind 9if I quit I don't get EI). My anxiety during COVID-19 is hurting my health (now and in the long term) more than COVID-19 itself.  I thought it was an end to my agony, but that was not the case.  Seeing the list of non-essential stores vs essential stores just means I have to continue commenting and working at an overcrowded Canadian tire for minimum wage with extreme and serious panic inducing anxiety around COVID-19. 

I heard from a coworker, from her friend that works at another store, that they are closing (tomorrow would be her last shift).  I have heard no word from my dealer/owner yet, if we would do the same, but  the assumed greedy behaviour doesn't make it seem that will happen.  If other CT stores close, while other remain opened, how is that fair?  How is it fair that some CT stores take this more seriously than others? How is it fair that some CT stores care more about their pocketbooks than the people working and shopping at their location?

&amp;#x200B;

I am so fed up with all of this and I cannot explain in words the emotions I deal wth daily.  At this point I feel quiting is my only option for my sanity and to no longer work in a hazard setting, due to COVID-19, but isn't a reasonable option for EI eligibility.  I would actually need to get sick it order to leave work and qualify for finical support. All of this seemed so fucked up to me.

I am curious what my dealer might say tomorrow about everything, if anything.

 Question for fellow people that work in regulated health professions during COVID I'm sure most of you have rules and protocols set in place at your clinics, and I had a few questions for how you handle certain situations.

At the office I work at we make it really clear : You MUST wear a mask, you must come ALONE to your appointment (unless you absolutely need a caregiver or 1 parent) \*\*don't get me started on people who try to bring their spouse, "just because"\*\*, wait outside until someone gets you, and **NO WALK INS- If you do not have a scheduled appointment you are not authorized to come in and must call from outside the clinic for assistance.** 

The last one especially peeves me when people don't listen to it.

We have these rules in place to protect our patients and staff. And because we have to screen and temperature check every person that walks in. You could be walking in off the street while another patient is leaving, causing you to bump into one another. Also, because you didn't call ahead, I wasn't able to screen you before you came in- I don't know where you've just been, who you've had contact with, if you've gone outside the province recently or are awaiting COVID results, etc. etc.

Why is this hard to follow? Any other people out there in the health care industry that can relate? 

Sorry for the rant! And unfortunately keeping the door locked isn't an option

 Situation looking bleak in Montreal In the province of Québec, cases have started picking up again in the past week or so, increasing exponentially instead of linearly. Though the increase in hospitalizations have been slowing down, which is a sign that the new cases could be due to better or more rigorous testing. We\`ll know better in a few days.

But today with the beautiful weather, pedestrians are out in full force, taking leisurely strolls and hanging out in parks. Many are ignoring distancing measures as they walk passed each other on sidewalks. About one person out of 20 is wearing a mask.

This is based on me walking my dog, weaving my way from sidewalk to sidewalk in order to avoid incoming pedestrians. And this is in Outremont, one of worst his neighbourhoods in the whole country.

I expect a new wave of cases to hit us in a couple of weeks.

 Poll Results &amp; Mod Applications Hi everyone,

Thanks for taking the time to respond to to the poll that was posted earlier this week. As a refresher, we wanted to see if the community would prefer a strengthening of posting guidelines that would be boiled down to: a) new posts being approved only if they are from government sources or reputable news agencies, and b) containing all discussion in a weekly or daily discussion thread as opposed to allowing for the creation of new discussion posts.

The results of that poll were basically split down the middle. 269 were for the proposal at poll close, with 255 against. This isn't a material difference and isn't one we can act upon given the split between the community - we won't be implementing this change as a result.

That being said, the community has grown significantly in the past number of weeks, and we've been paying attention to comments and posts (such as one's like [these] ( where people are feeling like there has been a shift in the subreddit and its tone. 

We are listening to this feedback. We created the subreddit with the purpose of sharing news and important information while also providing a forum for discussion and engagement between Canadians. Most of the time, this is the case. But we have noticed a slight uptick in uncivil, threatening, or derogatory posts, as well as sensationalism and conspiracy-theorizing. This isn't helpful or productive. As a mod team, we're doing the best we can to balance free speech and expression and this kind of behaviour. It isn't easy, and regardless of the path we go down, people won't be happy with our decision. 

What I will say up-front, as /u/AutoModerator posts in every thread: uncivil, threatening comments, wishing harm on other people or their families, or any other discourse that is fear-mongering, sensationalism, or untruthful, will not be tolerated. We will use our discretion in each circumstance as needed, from removing comments to banning people outright if called for. Please use the report button to bring these things to our attention, and speak with your voting power as users. 

To be clear, we feel as though the subreddit has, and will continue to, do a lot of good for everyone here. We started this forum to help each other during this challenging time, and we know that we have done that and will continue to do so. 

In terms of next steps, we feel as though the community could benefit from additional moderators to support us moving forward. We're opening up new applications.

 massaging the numbers You've probably seen the Sal Khan video that long story short says each death means 800 infections 20 days before the death.  It's a crude metric but it's the least bad we have to go on right now if we want any kind of real picture of Coronavirus infections in Canada instead of the silliness we're getting as official statistics.

Canada has 21 deaths, with the first occurring on March 11.  Back that up 20 days and you can posit the first 800 infections on February 20.  That was 30 days ago.  Given the posited doubling rate of five days, 30/5=6 so that 1 death could mean 800 doubled 6 times or 102,400  infections today.

The 21 deaths weren't all on the same day, but assuming they were gives an upper bound for posited number of infections under this crude model.  That works out to 2,150,400 infections, or 5.812% of Canada's population.

Working backwards, if Khan's assumption of a 1% death rate holds, we're talking an upper bound of 2,150,400/100 or 21,500 deaths in no sooner than another 20 days, by April 12.

I'm not trying to be alarmist here, just trying to cope with the Yes, Minister bad ganja I keep getting from Ontario reporting partial test results from some of the tests done 12-15 days ago.  If anyone can make a positive contribution to that, please do.

 Venting &amp; Educating others - Discussion Hoping it's ok to have a discussion about how we can collectively help get facts and precautions out to others. I'm trying to avoid certain details so apologies for the way details are omitted. 

I need to vent - an in-law relative of mine is a Mom, and a big city nurse. She doesn't get the magnitude of this, and today I'm just blown away and wanted to seek input on how hard we should push others. I feel like "a lot" is the answer but I don't want to be in fights with people. 

Talking with her today, she told me her son is \[again\] sick, and of course she sent him to school because he needs to be there to try out for a sports. I echoed "the serious warning is if you're sick stay home, don't go to work, don't go to school". Her retort, as usual, is "but it could just be a cold, people would all be staying home". Both her kids were sick just a week ago, and she was too, and she goes to work sick all the time. She would say "I don't get paid if I'm off sick". 

Now for history on this one, I had to fight with this same person when her snotty sick kids were going to be brought near my then-terminal (now RIP) parent who was undergoing chemo. Yes, I had to *fight* to explain the absense of an immune system. 

Questions for others as we are now in a position where we can help or not help the greater situation:

\&gt; how far do we go to try to drill this into people's heads?

\&gt; what do we reconcile with ourselves if/when we give up trying to help people (my wife's mom wants to travel to Russia in 2 weeks and is elderly, I said I disagree but she's on her own if she wants to)

\&gt; what polite and persuasive comments could perhaps help sternly make sure people understand this?

I personally feel there's a full half of society that doesn't think this is an issue, and I don't need to stand on a mountain screaming warnings, however I also think it's pretty !@#$ing serious. 

Thanks folks for any thoughts. And yes, I know she's a terrible example who deserves some strong flak, so keep that in mind, *I know.*

 For those who have children in daycares that have closed - is your daycare continuing to charge you fees even after they've closed? I posted this on our local subreddit, but thought others here might be able to provide some input as well. Our daycare closed for march break and the two weeks following march break and we were sent a message that said:

The Board of Directors has made the decision to adhere to our policy in continuing our fees during the program closures, however, families can expect a level of credit to their fees once programs reopen and after a financial analysis of these closures has been completed. The level of credit will take into account staffing and other costs, any mitigation funding (unknown at this time) and the evolving decision of the City of London and County of Middlesex subsidy departments.

So, it sounds like we're going to be charged full fees and there's a chance we'll be refunded some of them after the fact. Is that how other daycares have handled this?

My flight is going through Germany and then Vancouver, Canada in route to Portland, Oregon where my father lives.

My question is if I will be able to transit through Canada on my way to Portland due to Corona restrictions. 

I’ve read the information on the link below but I’m unsure if this applies to me as I will not be staying in Canada and will be flying directly to the USA.

This will likely be my last chance to visit my father so I want to do everything I can to ensure I can get in the country to visit him.

I’d really appreciate any help here including directly to other subreddits where I can get help.

 Quarantine exemption? Working in health research at a Quebec hospital I've just been offered a job that begins next week at a Quebec hospital. I'll be working in research. I'm in the US now, and will be crossing the border this week. I have a work permit. Does anyone know if health care research at a hospital is exempt from the 14 day quarantine? I'll be getting tested before I leave and will travel by car (land border crossing) and will be happy to wear a mask whenever necessary. Wondering if anyone has experience in this! Thanks in advance :)

 How can volunteers get involved? I remember when SARS happened, I was thinking how difficult it would be to track all the contacts, and whether there was a way I could volunteer to help compile lists of contacts and notify them, to help contain the spread. Thankfully SARS got snuffed out. 

Covid-19 appears to be a pandemic; it's probably near impossible to actually contain at this point. However, there's hope to slow the spread, to give humanity more time to develop better treatments that will increase the odds of survival. I think there's still value in collecting data to understand and limit the spread. 

In any case, the battle against Covid-19 is going to be a gargantuan fight. I'd like to think there's a way to organize volunteers to help this fight before the tsunami of quarantine and care needs hits. Any ideas?

 Help with CERB Hi, I keep trying to apply thru the website and i keep getting an error code. Is this the right subreddit for questions like these? I am out of work due to covid and need money ASAP. 

Do I need to do my taxes before I can get this? I was working in Japan last year which has a tax agreement with Canada...I’m very confused and need some help with this. I can’t call the CRA as it’s too busy right now.

 My Aunt fell ill on her way back to Canada and is stuck in Atlanta My family has already been greatly effected by all of this.  My Aunt and her husband were driving home early from their trip to Florida and made it as far as Atlanta before falling ill (shortness of breath and fever).  
She was rushed to the hospital by ambulance and has been in the ICU for the past 5 days.
They were having problems getting a covid19 test but they finally did and tested her yesterday (expecting results today).  
They want to get her oxygen up to a point where she can be released but I am really worried for her and her husband.  They aren’t in the greatest health to begin with (she has a puffer she uses daily and he has a pacemaker for his heart).  
I am at a loss as to what kind of measures are in place to get them home safely.  They have extended medical insurance but my fear is that it will not be honoured if she’s in there for a while.  
Any thoughts on who I should contact would be much appreciated.   We are trying to contact the Canadian Embassy in Atlanta to let them know what’s going on.
If you have parents or anyone you know still on route back from the US, please let them know to stay alert of overcrowded areas and wash/ sanitize their hands often!  From what’s going on with my family I have a strong hunch this thing is everywhere in the states right now.

I hope everyone’s family members make it back to 🇨🇦 safe and sound!

 Why is there so much mask stigma in Canada? Even in healthcare we are still discouraging patients wearing masks when they come in. Why? I am a nurse at a clinic that needs to remain open. We are not treating COVID19 patients but we might eventually encounter them. We are also screening anyone that comes in and if they have symptoms they are identified and given a mask. But many patients are coming in with no symptoms and are wearing a mask from home to protect themselves. Higher ups and coworkers are continuing to scoff at patients wearing masks when they come in (just the assymptomatic ones) These patients have no symptoms but just want to protect themselves. The original argument was they do not wear them properly and take them on and off without washing hands and touch things etc. The other argument was it can’t be good for them breathing in their own breath? It might make them sick? Is there any evidence for this? I feel like I’m the only one at work that thinks wearing a mask is a good idea. We should be educating patients on how to properly wear a mask in my opinion. And we should all be wearing them. Staff and patients. But I feel like I can’t even bring up the argument because everyone else seems to think the opposite. What should I do? Are they right?

 Those with underlying conditions So I thought it might be useful to share some of my experiences with managing this COVID19 situation as a person with an underlying condition (autoimmune). 

I will say at the outset that I have not confirmed whether I have COVID19. 

1. Came back from a business trip (USA) about a week ago. 

2. Was in self initiated quarantine since Monday of this past week. 

3. Starting to feel minor symptoms about 3 days ago. 

4. Current status is ongoing cough with slight elevation in temperature. Have felt congestion on the right side of my chest since the symptoms started to appear. 

Want to go to the hospital but I’ve been very cognizant of trying not to infect anyone. Telehealth has tremendous wait times but acknowledge the importance of going through them first, so I am waiting. 

I’m fortunate enough to not be at a terrible state and hope this is all really nothing to be concerned with. Nevertheless one cannot help but think about, what seems like, the endless cases of those who have been infected to date. 

My prayers and wishes go out to those who are navigating this and those who are protecting themselves from this. I wanted to share because I thought that, if it turns out that I have it, someone might get some closure hearing from another person who had an underlying condition. It was hard to find good news about those cases so I hoped to share mine. I will update as I go. Stay safe everyone. Yes the assumption I’m making is that this will be good news.

 My workplace told me I can’t work for 2 weeks if I leave the province Okay. So I live in Alberta and my fiancé and I have to travel to northern BC for a vehicle exchange with his family (has to be done in BC). I told my work I am doing this and needed the time off to go. 
However, I have just been informed that if I leave the province, my work can’t write me on the schedule for 2 weeks as I can’t work since I left the province. 
(Yes I realize that leaving the province isn’t necessary, however this does need to get done and his family is healthy and in a city with no active cases in BC. We are aware that if we were to exhibit symptoms at any point before hand, we wouldn’t go) 

Is my work allowed to restrict me from working due to this? It’s not mandatory to quarentine if I leave the province, only the country. So in my mind this doesn’t make a lot of sense and seems wrong to restrict someone from working.

 This health crisis will destroy us because of the minority of putridly evil inhuman villains among us Many of us are decent human beings pulling together at this difficult time and finding new strength in awareness of our common humanity.  But there is still a minority of satanic villains of venal selfishness that don't care if the whole world perishes as long as they've got theirs.  Their deliberate wrongdoing and harmdoing will mean the death of all of us. It's sad, but I don't see what can be done about it.

 How will covid19 change things? I post on my blog that I think the trend will be to be isolated, to have fun, even making money from home, even when the pandemic is over.

But this is just my perspective, what major changes do you think will happen after the pandemic?

 I live with someone who works in essential services and I have increased risk factors, what can I do? I'll try not to go into too much detail in order to protect everyone's privacy.  I live with a family member who works in essential services position.  I also have some increased risk health risk factors would increase my likelihood of being a serious case were I to contract the virus.

It is a shared living space (kitchen, pantry, laundry), but I am keeping in my own area, washing my hands dozens of times per day, and sterilizing everything as much as possible.  It's exhausting.

I'm totally willing get out of here, but I have no immediate options, and I feel like moving is a dangerous thing to do right now (meeting with a landlord, entering someone else's space, etc.)

What can I do?  I'm open to any ideas.

 If a family member returns to Canada and comes to live with family here, does the family have to quarantine for 14 days too? Title basically, and also is there a way to end quarantine early such as taking a pcr test and coming out as negative? The canada website is vague on a lot of things so I don't really know

We are in Ontario btw if that helps
