 Should essential businesses need bathroom/washing facilities? This is mainly for restaurants but really could be applied to any "essential business" that services the public. 

Do you think it should be mandatory for all essential businesses (grocery, take out, ect)  to have operational bathrooms that are open to the public?

 A Surrey BC School issues letter to parents that a person with COVID-19 was involved in a community use rental.  

March 8, 2020
Dear Parents and Guardians, 
Yesterday, the Fraser Health Authority informed the Surrey School District that an individual, 
who was in a school as part of a community use rental, has been diagnosed with the novel 
coronavirus (COVID-19). This letter is to inform parents and staff members of the steps that 
we are taking to prepare for the week ahead.
Fraser Health has deemed that the risk to the general school community and its members is 
low. The novel coronavirus is spread between people by droplets, which requires close 
contact with saliva or mucus from the mouth, nose or throat of an infected person. As such, 
individuals not in direct contact with the affected individual are at low risk. With this 
information, out of an abundance of caution, we have:
• Initiated a deep clean protocol in the specific school over the weekend in preparation 
for classes on Monday;
• Postponed the community use rental group permit until further notice.
As always, Health Canada reminds us that the best way to protect yourself is to wash your 
hands with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds and to cover your mouth and nose 
with your arm when you cough or sneeze and to wash your hands as soon as possible 
afterwards. To help students comply with this advice, we will reinforce these 
recommendations on our daily morning announcements and in classrooms around the district.
Further information about novel coronavirus is available on the BC Centre for Disease Control 
website (www.bccdc.ca/about/news-stories/stories/2020/information-on-novel-
coronavirus). In addition, Fraser Health has developed a webpage answering common 
questions about novel coronavirus available at fraserhealth.ca/coronavirus
If we receive any additional information, we will be in contact with parents and staff. Thank 
you for your patience as we work through this together as a community and in close 
collaboration with our Health Authorities.
Sincerely,
Jordan Tinney
Superintendent of Schools

 Susceptibility to misinformation about COVID-19 - Are you seeing the results of this study in your communities? Heightened susceptibility to misinformation appears to be linked to reduced mask-wearing and social distancing.

A recent study that appeared in the journal Royal Society Open Science indicates that individuals with  a poor understanding of quantitative information are more likely to endorse myths about COVID-19 and those who believe such misinformation are less likely to follow public health guidance such as wearing a mask in public.

 Are we seeing this complication of Covid + Kawasaki in kids here, too? Uk is reporting multiple cases of possible Covid complications in children with Kawasaki. 

"More than a dozen children have fallen ill with a new and potentially fatal combination of symptoms apparently linked to Covid-19, including a sore stomach and heart problems.

The children affected appear to have been struck by a form of toxic shock syndrome. All have been left so seriously unwell that they have had to be treated in intensive care.

At least one has received extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) treatment, which is used when someone’s life is at risk because they can no longer breathe for themselves.

[NHS]( bosses are so concerned that they have written to doctors alerting them to the emergence of these cases and asked them to urgently refer any children with similar symptoms to hospital."

 CBC News your life during the coronavirus **Let's face the facts**

First and foremost, during a pandemic like this governments should **double down** on their efforts to minimize deaths within a country. Whether that's done through strict social distancing to **flatten the curve**, thus not straining the health care system in a situation where minimal ICU beds or ventilators are available. 

Having said that, I think that our lives will be changed for at **least a year, or until a vaccine is available** following this outbreak. *Companies will be out of business, people will be reluctant to participate in large events, germaphobia will continue to proliferate as it rightly should*.

 It's very possible that children in Canada won't be going back to school even by this coming September. If we fast forward 4-5 months from now, to July or August, and we have many, many more times the number of cases of Covid than we do now, and a strained health care system with a mounting death toll, then I think it will be very hard for our leaders to say that its time for kids to head back into classrooms.  Public health decisions are made based on science, but also on politics as well as emotion.  So I just can't see it being seen as acceptable to send kids back with a huge number of cases.

If they do go back, it'll be will all sorts of conditions -- rigorous health checks, hand sanitize everywhere, smaller classes, and whatever else can be done.

But realistically we might still be hunkered down and kids might have to continue studies online.

But we can hasten our battle against this thing, and win it, if we just follow the guidelines of social distancing.

 Giant Tiger Still Maintaining Increased Hero Wages During COVID-19 Response - POST PROMISE &gt;[Are you offering additional compensation to your front-line workers?](  
&gt;  
&gt;To thank our front-line workers for their dedication to ensuring our communities are able to have access to their essential needs we are offering a thank you bonus of $2 on hourly pay as well as financial assistance for those associates who are in mandatory quarantine.

*Canadian discount retailer looking to hire additional temporary employees based on increased demand*

Giant Tiger Stores Limited (GTSL) is one of the only Canadian retailers to have maintained the increased hourly wages of its store, distribution centre, and trucking employees by $2.00/hour. The leading Canadian discount retailer is also implementing further measures in its over 250 stores across the country in an effort to increase the protection of customers and staff. 

"The ongoing outstanding efforts of our employees to ensure our stores continue providing our valued customers a convenient, safe and comforting place to shop during this difficult time have been nothing short of extraordinary and deserve financial recognition," said Paul Wood, President and Chief Operating Officer, Giant Tiger Stores Limited. "I'm incredibly proud of how our staff continues to rise to the occasion and we look forward to welcoming new temporary staff to fill our ongoing needs as we move through this situation together." 

In addition to an increased cleaning regiment and heightened sanitization and disinfection activities, Giant Tiger has taken further additional steps to maintain customer and employee safety at stores during this challenging time, including:

* Asking customers to practice social distancing while shopping.
* Encouraging customers to use debit or credit, where possible. Giant Tiger will continue to accept cash.
* Closing in-store public washrooms and change rooms until further notice.
* Reminders at the front door of stores for customers feeling unwell or who have recently travelled to kindly shop online at gianttiger.com.
* **No longer charging for plastic bags. If a customer opts to use a reusable bag, Giant Tiger is asking that the customer place their items in their bag. Customers still receive Giant Tiger's reusable bag credit of** **$0.03.**

As part of the national retailer's commitment to keeping its local communities safe during this challenging time, Giant Tiger was one of the very first companies to join the POST Promise shortly after the program launched in June.  Each of the over 250 Giant Tiger locations nation-wide proudly display POST Promise signage throughout its stores.

"Providing a healthy and safe place for Canadians to shop for exactly what they need and want for their families is our number one priority," said Paul Wood, President and CEO of Giant Tiger Stores Limited.  "We've taken numerous steps from the onset of the pandemic, based on guidance from public health authorities, to help maintain a safe and healthy in-store shopping environment. Partnering with POST Promise is just one of the many ways that our over 250 stores across Canada can publicly demonstrate our unwavering commitment."

"POST Promise is proud to partner with Giant Tiger who has been a leader in health and safety since the start of this pandemic and shares our deep commitment to keeping our local communities safe," said Laura Hearn, President &amp; Executive Director of the POST Promise. "As we head into the most important retail season of the year this November and December, it is even more critical that Canadian businesses come together to do everything possible to protect both the safety of consumers as well as our local economies. I thank Giant Tiger for its tremendous support and encourage all businesses to make the POST Promise."

"As consumers continue to be concerned with health and safety due to rising COVID-19 cases in different regions of the country, it is more important than ever before to ensure measures are in place to keep customers and employees safe." said Diane J. Brisebois, President &amp; CEO of Retail Council of Canada. "Business across the country are joining POST Promise to help restore confidence and protect Canadians. Together, we must safeguard the most important economic buying season and the Retail Council of Canada applauds Giant Tiger for doing its part to help keep its customers and employees feeling safe - especially during this holiday shopping period."

**About The POST Promise**

POST Promise/Promesse APRES is a national, bilingual private sector-led initiative, in collaboration with various levels of government,  designed to help Canadians confidently and safely shop and work in local businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Businesses who "make the promise" commit to implementing five key steps, which were developed in consultation with the Public Health Agency of Canada, to help stop the spread of COVID-19. Participating businesses are able to display the POST Promise/Promesse APRES logo – a national symbol that acts as a clear indication they are doing their part to protect their customers' and employees' health and safety.  The Post Promise is run by a national not-for-profit corporation that was built specifically for this effort. To learn more about the POST Promise initiative, visit [www.postpromise.com](

*To meet ongoing increased demand, Giant Tiger is actively recruiting for in-store positions. Those interested in applying are asked to visit* [*www.gianttiger.com*]( *to explore current opportunities across the country.*

 CDC Initial R0 likely to be 5.7 in Wuhan  

We found R0 is likely to be 5.7 given our current state of knowledge, with a broad 95% CI (3.8–8.9). Among many factors, the lack of awareness of this new pathogen and the Lunar New Year travel and gathering in early and mid-January 2020 might or might not play a role in the high R0. A recent study based on structural analysis of the virus particles suggests SARS-CoV-2 has a much higher affinity to the receptor needed for cell entry than the 2003 SARS virus ([*21*]( providing a molecular basis for the high infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2.

How contagious SARS-CoV-2 is in other countries remains to be seen. Given the rapid rate of spread as seen in current outbreaks in Europe, we need to be aware of the difficulty of controlling SARS-CoV-2 once it establishes sustained human-to-human transmission in a new population ([*20*]( Our results suggest that a combination of control measures, including early and active surveillance, quarantine, and especially strong social distancing efforts, are needed to slow down or stop the spread of the virus. If these measures are not implemented early and strongly, the virus has the potential to spread rapidly and infect a large fraction of the population, overwhelming healthcare systems. Fortunately, the decline in newly confirmed cases in China and South Korea in March 2020 and the stably low incidences in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore strongly suggest that the spread of the virus can be contained with early and appropriate measures.

 The Company I work for is Essential and not following Public Health Recommendations, what should I do? I am the health and safety representative for a medium sized print and web company in Ontario, and am currently working from home. Today, on our Teams chat, the workers still working on location posted a birthday gathering for one of the sales people (these gatherings were tradition pre-covid-19). After reading up on the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act, it appears that this may have been breaking the law... essential business are required to follow guidelines under Schedule 3 of the act, notably: **1.(2) The person responsible for a place of business that is open shall operate the business in compliance with the advice, recommendations and instructions of public health officials, including any advice, recommendations or instructions on physical distancing, cleaning or disinfecting.**

I brought this to everyones attention, and to my employer... beyond that is there anything I should do? What is the enforcement of these requirements? What are the penalties? I've been having trouble finding this information. I assume people are just ignorant of the requirements, and that is possibly my fault as health and safety representative, but I just got back from a parental leave that conveniently coincided with the outbreak. Can anyone offer advice? Thanks.

Starting an initiative to support efforts to reduce corona virus, while setting goals and keeping people connected. It's called the Between Four Walls Challenge. Any help would be amazing!

Join the between four walls challenge today to help conquer corona virus (covid-19) together! There’s no cost to join,  and everyone can participate in the fun.   

1. Stay at home for at least 14 days. Do you have what it takes to survive between your four walls? We’ve all watched reality shows that test the limits, but if you were really stuck on an island, or locked in a house BETWEEN FOUR WALLS, can you do it? There’s always grocery delivery, right? Prove it.  

2. Set goals. Did you fall off track with your 2020 New Year’s resolution? Perhaps there’s a skill you keep putting off because of time. Set one or more goals that that you want to accomplish between your four walls. What's your goal?  

3. Share with friends. We’re all in it together, so share your goals and successes with the community. Let’s support each other and stand together. Connect on Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter – don’t forget to tag u/bfwchallenge [\#bfwchallenge]( and to subscribe to the between four walls YouTube channel.
