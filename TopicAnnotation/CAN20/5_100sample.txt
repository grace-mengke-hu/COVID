 "No penalty for misuse"... 

A link to an article from April 11, 2020 that discusses CERB eligibility and misuse.  No penalty for misuse of CERB, just pay it back according to Huffington Post. 

Now why are we suddenly saying people will be kicked off their programs and have to pay taxes and interest on their CERB payments?  

No Canadian need worry about food or rent.  Really?

 Hey Nova Scotia... Can we get an actual update on the amount of tests being done in this province?  Alberta, BC, Ontario are updating daily (some, twice per day!)  We have to wait for the weekly report to come out, and the report is always approx a week late!  

I would like to see Respiratory watch week 10 - March 1- March 7, but it has yet to be posted.  The report for the previous week wasn't posted until last Friday (5 days later!)

 [ 

Also -- Respiratory watch week 9 - Feb 23 - Feb 29 states only 20 tests were done.  For one week?  This seems extremely low for the whole province!  

\*\* With all the above said, is there any other site that is posting the number of tests being administered?  I have looked but have yet to uncover anything.  I think we all deserve to know what is going on!

 The unemployed/underemployed private sector can not afford to pay the salaries of the non-working segment of the public sector One million Canadians have applied for EI.  The private sector can no longer afford to fund the public sector employees who are non-essential, or not working.  

The money currently being used to pay those salaries needs to be redistributed to fight the pandemic, both health wise and economy-wise.  

In Ontario, teachers, EAs, other provincial, and municipal civil servants continue to receive full pay and benefits while on paid leave.  

The CRA confirmed that non-essential employees who are unable to wfh because of lack of technology will continue to be paid.  

There are 160,000 teachers in Ontario alone. Not including EAs, admin staff, and other support staff who are earning 100% of their income and doing close to 0% of their job duties.  

I hope when the immediate danger is over, we have a fucking uprising about this.

 Help! CoVID CERB Hiiii! Does anyone have any advice? I ended work March 15th, which I know is the cut off date for the CERB. I did put that on my application as my last day worked as my job shut down March 16th due to COVID. I applied for EI on March 17th. I filled out some of my reports. I accidentally forgot to add March 15th as a day I worked. I was looking at a previous schedule online that didn’t include a shift I picked up (the shift on March 15th). I have already submitted my report and my MyService account shows in latest claim details that I will be receiving CERB. However, I’m worried that they may see that I didn’t add hours to my report for March 15th and they may think that I didn’t work that day. I’ve been trying to call for three days to speak to a EI representative with no luck getting through at all. I’m assuming that since it says on my latest claim details that I am receiving CERB that it will be CERB anyways. But does anyone know anything or have any advice? Currently still trying to get through right now.

 CERB Federal COVID-19 benefits program MegaThread ## How can I apply?

There are two ways for Canadians to apply: online with CRA My Account or over the phone with an automated phone service. If applying online or by phone, Canadians will receive a payment by direct deposit or by cheque.

If applying online, Canadians will have to sign into CRA My Account. They should go to COVID-19: Canada Emergency Response Benefit in the alert banner at the top of the web page, select the period they want to apply for, declare that they qualify for the benefit and confirm the government has the right payment information.

If applying over the phone, Canadians can call the automated toll-free line at 1-800-959-2019. This is a dedicated line for CERB applications. Before people call, they should have their social insurance number and postal code handy to verify their identity.

Both of these services will be available 21 hours a day, seven days a week. Both services are closed from 3 a.m. to 6 a.m. ET for maintenance.

For more information, Canadians should go to [canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/benefits/apply-for-cerb-with-cra.html#how](

Applicants will need to confirm that they meet the eligibility criteria, and information that they provide during the application process may be verified later, the government said.

The benefit is available from March 15 to Oct. 3. The deadline for applications is Dec. 2.

The government said Canadians can prepare to apply for the CERB by signing on to CRA My Account. They should also make sure their direct deposit and mailing information is up to date with the CRA.

 massaging the numbers You've probably seen the Sal Khan video that long story short says each death means 800 infections 20 days before the death.  It's a crude metric but it's the least bad we have to go on right now if we want any kind of real picture of Coronavirus infections in Canada instead of the silliness we're getting as official statistics.

Canada has 21 deaths, with the first occurring on March 11.  Back that up 20 days and you can posit the first 800 infections on February 20.  That was 30 days ago.  Given the posited doubling rate of five days, 30/5=6 so that 1 death could mean 800 doubled 6 times or 102,400  infections today.

The 21 deaths weren't all on the same day, but assuming they were gives an upper bound for posited number of infections under this crude model.  That works out to 2,150,400 infections, or 5.812% of Canada's population.

Working backwards, if Khan's assumption of a 1% death rate holds, we're talking an upper bound of 2,150,400/100 or 21,500 deaths in no sooner than another 20 days, by April 12.

I'm not trying to be alarmist here, just trying to cope with the Yes, Minister bad ganja I keep getting from Ontario reporting partial test results from some of the tests done 12-15 days ago.  If anyone can make a positive contribution to that, please do.

 A specific question on quarantine I’m flying into Canada from out of country, and I will be quarantining at a hotel for 14 days. I’ll arrive at my quarantine place at night (say around 8pm) on the first day. Does that mean I’m only allowed to leave after 8 pm two weeks later? Or is quarantine over once you reach the 14th day? 

I’m asking because my hotel reservation is exactly 14 days. If it is the case that I should stay until after 8pm on the 14th day, I’d have to leave the hotel at night which is kind of unfavourable for me. 

Does any sort of government body care about these timing specifics or am I being too neurotic about this? Thanks

 CERB Clarification and Gap I found this: 

Nicely summarized by a friend of mine: 

If you go to around the 7 minute mark, that’s when the specifics of who can &amp; can’t apply for Canada’s new aid package begins to be discussed. 

*it is a flat amount of $2000/month  

*you need to have had no income for 14 consecutive days to apply for the CERB 

*if you’re a parent who has to stay home *without any pay* to care for your children, you CAN apply

*you can’t be making ANY income while you are receiving it, so if your work has been cut down, but you are still in fact earning some money, you can NOT apply

*if you are technically employed but not working/receiving money for the time being from your employer due to the pandemic, you CAN apply

——

The problem with the CERB, as I understand it is that it doesn’t help anyone who is making reduced income, whether due to having to be home caring for children who’s schools are closed, or reduced hours because clients aren’t hiring freelancers, etc.

The PM / government need to figure out how to fix this gap.

 Canada's "Have Provinces" and "Have not Provinces" of COVID-19 **The "Have Provinces":**

[Nova Scotia]( Active Cases, Hospitalization, ICU admissions slightly off peak. New cases trending up, but flattening. 1.02 in 100,000 hospitalized. Mortality per 100,000 population: 1.23 

[Alberta]( Active Cases, Hospitalization, ICU admissions at peak. New cases trending up steeper than they did in March. 1.59 in 100,000 hospitalized. Mortality per 100,000 population: 1.5

[Ontario]( Active Cases, Hospitalization at peak. New cases trending up after slowing, but shallower than they did in March. 5.97 in 100,000 hospitalized. Mortality per 100,000 population: 4.48 

[Quebec]( Active Cases, Hospitalization at peak. New cases trending up after flattening, but shallower than they did in March. 14.97 in 100,000 hospitalized. Mortality per 100,000 population: 13.28. The situation is by far the worst in Canada.

**The "Have not Provinces":**

[Saskatchewan](  Active Cases, Hospitalization, ICU admissions are all 14 days or more from peak. New cases are flat at just above 3 cases a day. 0.42 in 100,000 hospitalized. Mortality per 100,000 population: 0.34

[Manitoba]( Active Cases, Hospitalization, ICU admissions are all 14 days or more from peak. New cases are flat at just above 1 case a day. 0.51 in 100,000 hospitalized. Mortality per 100,000 population: 0.44

[Newfoundland &amp; Labrador]( Active Cases, Hospitalization, ICU admissions are all 14 days or more from peak. New cases are flat at just above 1 case a day. Had 5 straight days of zero cases. 1.15 in 100,000 hospitalized. Mortality per 100,000 population: 0.58

[New Brunswick]( Active Cases, Hospitalization, ICU admissions are all 14 days or more from peak. New cases are flat and at zero. Had only 1 new case in the last 7 days. 0.64 in 100,000 hospitalized. No deaths. The situation is clearly the best in Canada.

**The odd one out:**

[British Columbia](  Active Cases are back at peak recently after going 14 days off peak. Hospitalization, ICU admissions are all 14 days or more from peak. The 7 days moving average for new cases is flat and off the peak. It is levelled at roughly 33 new cases a day,  comparably higher than the "Have not Provinces" but is not trending up as the "Have Provinces". 2.2 in 100,000 hospitalized. Mortality per 100,000 population: 1.76. Both statistics are higher than some of the "Have Provinces".

I teach English at a private institution in Ontario (for students on visa from China) I usually get paid $24 an hour, but my boss says they have to pay me $20 because they have less students coming from China because of the virus, so they can't afford to pay me my normal amount.

 PSA: News just in from my accountant; Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) will not consider dividends as a qualifying income. Any business owners who receive only dividends here? Dear Clients,

The “breaking news” is that the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) will not consider dividends as a qualifying income.

To qualify, applicants must have had $5,000 in employment income, self-employment income, or maternity or parental leave benefits for 2019 or in the 12-month period preceding the day they make the application. And of course, to not have touched any income during a period of 14 consecutive days within a 30-day period.

A worker (whether employed or self-employed) is eligible for an income support payment if:

(a) they cease working for reasons related to COVID-19 for at least 14 consecutive days

* they are sick or taking care of someone who is sick with COVID-19
* they are quarantined

\-     they must stay home without pay to care for children who are sick or at home because of school and daycare closures

(b) they do not receive any income from employment or self-employment during this period

The support payment is $2,000 per month for up to 4 months. The program runs from March 15th to October 3, 2020. Applications should be available by April 6th via CRA’s secure portal.

You do not qualify for this benefit if you were not receiving a salary or reporting self-employed business income on your personal tax return. &gt;!Business owners who receive only dividends do not qualify for this benefit. !&lt;

 [Toronto Star]”[N]ow about 70 per cent of new infections are coming in the broader community” “Ontario’s regional health units are reporting another 24-hour period with more than 400 new COVID-19 cases as the rate of new infections has continued to rise in recent days, according to the Star’s latest count.

As of 11 a.m. Saturday, the health units had reported a total of 26,301 confirmed and probable cases, including 2,114 deaths.

The total of 475 new confirmed and probable cases reported since the same time Friday morning was once again up from recent daily averages, a sign the provincewide decline in infection rate has reversed in recent days.

Meanwhile, the recent increase in cases is now primarily coming from infections in the broader community outside outbreaks in places like seniors homes, according to a Star analysis based on data from Ontario’s hardest-hit health units. In mid-April, at the peak of infections in the province, most new case appeared in institutional outbreaks; since then, the rate of outbreak cases have fallen, and now about 70 per cent of new infections are coming in the broader community.

On Saturday morning, the province released its version of the same data, which showed the same trends.

The province once again reported another day in which testing labs completed far fewer COVID-19 tests than the target of 16,000 daily. The 11,028 tests completed the previous day was the sixth straight well below the target. The province says the labs have the capacity to complete about 20,000 tests daily; last week they completed as many as 18,354 in a day.

In the past, spikes in case counts have followed days with high testing rates, and vice versa for days of low testing.

The number of new cases reported each day had been on a downward trend since hitting a peak of more than 700 in late April. However, the average has begun to rise slightly after flattening out to about 360 cases per day last week; before this week, the province last saw more than 400 cases on May 8.

Meanwhile, the 24 fatal cases reported in the province since Friday morning was back in line with the recent falling trend. The rate of deaths is down considerably since peaking at more than 90 deaths in a day earlier this month, about two weeks after the peak in the daily case totals

 Can a business ask its employees to pay for PPE? Hello all, I'm hoping I can ask this Reddit community for some guidance. 

I am a healthcare worker (allied health) and I work at a multi-disciplinary private clinic. I work alongside physiotherapists, chiropodists, massage therapists. 

Yesterday the owner of the clinic mentioned that the higher cost of PPE for us to use should be covered by the staff. She suggested taking 1% of our pay to cover the higher cost of PPE. All the workers feel that it is the responsibility of the business to provide us with appropriate PPE but we don't know what kind of arguments we can present to back up our stance on this topic.

We understand that at this time the cost of running the clinic is much higher than usual. However, we are all already taking a significant pay cut since our capacity to see patients is greatly reduced. We are not paid hourly but paid per service, so seeing fewer patients in a day equals much lower pay. We do not get paid for all the extra time spent cleaning between patients (this even includes cleaning the bathroom if a patient needs to use it while in the clinic and this is not in my job description!). So instead of needing to hire cleaning staff to maintain the standards the healthcare practitioners are all pitching in with their time and elbow grease to help out. We feel that needing to pay for our own PPE is further diminishing our value and don't think it is a reasonable thing to do.

I'm very curious to see what other people's opinions are on this matter and if anyone has some ideas for creative solutions?

I appreciate the time you took to read my post. Thanks in advance.

 Shaw Cable Fail &gt;Hi,  
&gt;  
&gt;We continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely and we know that the threat posed by COVID-19 will result in some Shaw customers facing unexpected financial challenges. If you are having any concerns paying your monthly Shaw bill due to the COVID-19 situation, we will work with you to find a flexible payment arrangement that considers your financial and connectivity needs.  
&gt;  
&gt;As of Mar 28, 2020, we noticed there's an overdue balance on your account. Your total balance is $X. Should we not receive full payment on any outstanding balance on your account, it will be fully disconnected in 16 days. As Shaw does not offer payment extensions, you will need to make a payment for the full outstanding balance. But don’t worry, we’re here to help you avoid this potential service disruption. 

Can someone parse this for me because I surely must be smoking crack? Or, is whomever wrote this?

The first paragraph says that they will work with me to find a flexible payment arrangement that considers my needs.

Second paragraph gives ultimatum that X (paid in full) must be done by Y (16 days) or Z (cut off).

If my only option is that I "need to make a payment for the full outstanding balance" or else I will be "fully disconnected in 16 days" - where is the even *potential* for flexibility?

But "don't worry, you're here to help avoid this"? I'm terribly confused by this. 

It almost seems as if the first paragraph was injected on the top of their email template for billing issues; I could potentially understand that, except the last sentence of the second paragraph.

How about offering to retroactively decrease my bill to the current advertised price? Real messed up how adsense and the like always point Shaw ads at me, offering 600mbps for $65 when I'm paying \~$100.

Of course, I will be speaking with them; will see what happens, but I felt like this was a huge fail in public communications. If truly my only option, as it says, is to pay in full by that date then, I don't know, they could try this:

"We understand many customers may be facing challenges during this time and are willing to work out flexible payment arrangements where we can however accounts that are facing disconnection will need to be paid in full before the disconnection date."

At least that's honest, straight forward and professional. Saying you're willing to make a payment arrangement then immediately in the next paragraph lay out the terms of the only possibility is not only confusing but misleading.

Or maybe I'm just being over-senstive.

 Ontario: Get Ford to re-instate mandatory sick leave pay to protect us all. We need to force Doug Ford / the PCs to re-instate sick leave pay. Ford cut worker rights ([

including  mandatory sick leave pay. The people most affected by these roll-backs of worker rights are low-paid workers who work in the service sector--retail, restaurants, etc. Many live life on the financial edge and can't afford to take a few weeks off without pay. They will be forced to go to their jobs, and will spread the virus if they go to work sick. Companies don't have to pay workers anything for sick days now. 

Write to your member of provincial parliament (MPP) *now* and tell them to immediately not just re-instate, but ***increase*** ***number of paid sick leave days*** for workers in our province.  Even if you have benefits yourself, you will be impacted by this roll-back of workers rights by Conservatives in our province. 

Tell your MPP that Ford's labour laws put all of us at risk and they must do better. If you have a Conservative MPP, tell them what you think of their policies towards workers in Ontario. If your MPP is not Conservative, tell them that as the opposition they need to get this in front of parliament every single session until it is changed.

 Should I apply to CERB? I'm probably one of many, but I'm a student who was hoping to get work after I graduate, but with this coronavirus stuff going on, places I could apply to with my type of degree aren't considered essential. I've tried applying to grocery stores and other places still open, but I haven't heard anything back. So I applied to CERB and have now received a note in the mail asking for more paperwork to be submitted. I guess my question is, is it worth it?

I'm not sure how the whole CERB thing works, I admit I should've done better research before I applied, but I couldn't find anything great. Will my taxes be worse/more confusing after this? Do I have to pay this back? Is there a way to cancel this application at all? I'm more nervous now about it than when I first applied!

 "Compensation Plan" from employer while laid off because of coronavirus... can I still apply for CERB? Hi guys, 

I work for a company within the Canadian Tire parent company chain. All the stores of the company I work for are closed obviously because of coronavirus. I have not had a shift in over a month. I applied for and received the CERB. I got $2000 in my account yesterday. 

However, today I received a "compensation plan" payment from my employer. They did not communicate to us they were doing this. I'm wondering if I'll have to pay back the CERB money I received. Again, the money I received from my employer is not payment for labour... it's a sort of compassion benefit they're providing us with. It was around $100 (my typical pay cheque from them).

Can I keep applying for the CERB?

 A question I haven't seen answered about CERB vs EI My workplace is still open with a skeleton crew producing orders (manufacturing). Many employees were laid off in the last 2 weeks due to the pandemic. 

Now we are receiving some emergency orders and calling some people back to work, at least temporarily. 

With EI, I have a very good grasp on how working effects your payable amount. People can work, and it is advantageous for them to do so. 

With CERB, the eligibility is different. You must be without work for 14 consecutive days in a 4 week period. 

My question is, if these people come back to work for one week, will they now have to be unemployed for a further 2 weeks before being eligible to apply for CERB? That's the impression that I get. In that case, would they then move to regular EI benefits? Or nothing at all? 

Obviously these people applied for EI when they were laid off, not CERB, but they'll be moved to that program instead.

I looked it up what to do but all i got was news articles saying that happened if you applied more than once, which i didnt.. i’m not gonna spend it because it also said you would have to pay it back. Any idea what i should do? Are they just paying early for next month? Will it just be on my taxes ?

 How to do EI Reports While Receiving CERB Through EI (Which is called EIERB) Hi I have done my EI Reports Up until April 11th can’t do my other ones obviously until April 25th. Initially I was backlogged in the EI Claim side when I first applied after March 15. My claim was approved and I received 2k from ServiceCanada so therefore Im getting the CERB through EI (Thank you Service Canada as there was confusion but you guys didn’t leave us hanging) I did my reports after receiving my EI-CERB 2k and was wondering when I complete these reports if I have to report my EICERB payment Or do I just Keep completing my Ei reports in the standard fashion for as long as I am in Quarantine (family member has had COVID and Doctor has stated they need 3-6weeks to recover unfortunately I am The primary caretaker and my home is small so everyday I an home I am Basically exposed to potential COVID (no other way around it Iv done the best to isolate a section of my home along with Aiding my FM using gloves and mask). Just want to make sure that I dont have to report it and that I simply complete them in the standard way while Im on EI CERB to receive the 2k (whereas my standard benefit rate on EI would be less than 2k a month). Thanks in advance

 Question about EI / CERB Hey guys 

Just had a question regarding EI while receiving cerb and wondering if anyone is able to answer it

I applied for EI around March 20th so as a result was automatically enrolled into the cerb benifit program 

I’m just curious about how EI works while receiving cerb. 

1. Do I continue to do the EI online weekly reports?
2. If so do I report the $500 cerb benifit as income? 

Any answer would be appreciated thanks!

 My company is offering payment of 75% through CEWS, am I still eligible for CERB when my salary will still be below $1000? Hello everyone,

Much like most of you, I was laid off due to the corona virus. I have applied for the CERB and received payment. Now my company is offering to pay inactive employees 75% of our regular earnings through the CEWS (Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy) program. In my case, since I am just a student working part-time, my monthly salary through CEWS will still be below $1000.

The CERB just updated its eligibility to employees with salary below $1000/month. So if I accept the CEWS, in that sense, I would still be eligible for CERB right?

I called the CIC agent as well, he said I would still be eligible as they don’t care how the company pays me, as long as I have employment income below $1000 I should be eligible. 

I am not entirely sure still so I am asking here if any of you are in the same situation as I am in. And btw, our company provides us with the chance to decline the CEWS payment, that’s why I am asking in the first place.

Another question: 

The CERB since updating its new conditions, it has two versions for the first period and I am wondering what should I follow: 

1st version:

“You stopped or will stop working due to COVID-19, and:
You are applying for the first time 
For at least 14 days in a row during the 4-week payment period, you do not expect to receive more than $1,000 (before taxes) from employment and self-employment income
You are re-applying for another period 
You do not expect your situation to change during this 4-week period and you do not expect to receive more than $1,000 (before taxes) from employment and self-employment income.”

AND

2nd version:

“You have stopped or will stop working for reasons related to COVID-19, and
For your first CERB application: You have stopped or will stop working for at least 14 consecutive days within the four week benefit period and have or expect to receive no more than $1,000 in combined employment or self-employment income for these consecutive days.
For your subsequent CERB applications: You continue to not work and expect to remain in this position for the entire four week period for which you are applying and expect to receive no more than $1,000 in combined employment or self-employment income.”

They differ in the “14 days part”, first one is you just don’t have salary excess $1000 for 14 days. 2nd one is you don’t work for 14 days.

In my case, I stopped working since 17 March. But the ROE my company released for the whole company is 4 April (I still receive salary up to 4 April, but still below $1000). So I wonder if I am eligible or not for the period of 15 March to 11 April.

Please give me your professional thought on this. Thank you.

 Covid 19 Employment related questions? I have been laid off from my job since October of 2019.  However, I have been able to pick up many shifts since I was laid off from October to March 15th when my place of employment shut down due to Coronavirus.  I have been reporting those earnings to EI and EI have been adjusting my payout.  My employer applied for and qualified for The CEWS and I have been receiving income from them.  I have just been reporting this income to EI as normal and they have been adjusting my EI payout.  Is this ok?  Am I going about this properly?

Would any or all of the combined earnings that an employee receives from the CEWS (75%) and my employer (25%) count towards Insurable earnings and/or Insurable Hours?

Being that the CEWS is retroactive to March 15th, would/should this than mean that any vacation or portion that has been used by my employer would/should be replaced since the subsidy is retroactive to March 15th?  Is the company not double dipping if they do not replace some or all of that?

The Baseline remuneration for Calculating CEWS

When calculating the wage subsidy, you will need to determine an employee's baseline remuneration. Baseline remuneration is considered to be the average weekly eligible remuneration paid to an employee during the period of January 1, 2020, to March 15, 2020. However, you may exclude from your calculation any period of seven or more consecutive days in respect of which the employee was not paid.

​My employer for some reason calculated my baseline renumeration on the average of 6 weeks prior to the shutdown even though I had NO periods of seven or more consecutive days in respect of which I was NOT paid.  Had they used the full period of January 1, 2020, to March 15, 2020 my baseline renumeration would have been more.

 Another EI/CERB Question Hi guys!

I was temporarily laid off effective March 29th, and was told by my employer to apply for EI, which I did on April 6th after receiving my ROE. I got my EI access code in the mail yesterday and set up my service Canada account, and filed out my first report. 

I’ve been receiving so many mixed messages about CERB vs EI, and I was wondering if anyone has any clarification on what is being provided to those of us who applied for EI and when (I have been told NOT to apply for CERB).

Does CERB overrule EI in this situation? What does it mean when they say they’ve “streamlined” the EI/CERB applications? I am hella confused, haven’t been able to get much information online, and can’t get through any call lines. 

Any information is appreciated! Stay safe out there folks.
++++++++++
 Confused about EI and CERB payments I got laid off on March 17th and applied for EI right away which automatically registered me for CERB
Yesterday (April 7th) I got paid $500 from CERB plus 2 weeks of EI, and I got paid more today (April 8th) as well?
Is EI getting paid on a monthly basis or weekly or bi weekly? I am just confused as to why I got 2 large lump sum payments back to back. 
Not that I am complaining, but I am just confused about it, especially considering I am going to have to pay taxes on this.... 
Any input from others?
++++++++++
 Does the app tell you WHEN you were exposed? I'm curious... Because if you were exposed 14 days prior to receiving the alert, it's quite a major difference than a few days (Someone could have been tested the same day they were 15 minutes next to you, and the results would be back 1-2 days later, in which you would get alert).

Between how many you would have to alert who spent time a decent amount of time with you, to how accurate the test will be (requires at least 5 or so days from exposure to be accurate).

 CERB Eligibility Question I am still employed, but I stopped working on March 14th due to fear of Covid19. I got paid on March 26, and am if I am eligible for CERB? It says '14 days of no income' so should I wait exactly 2 weeks from the day I got paid to apply? Or should I apply on opening day?

 CERB eligibility with part time job still paying workers for missed shifts My work made the decision to lay off the entire staff.

I cannot get EI due to lack of hours, but I meet every other criteria for CERB except income as my work is has kept us on the schedule and paying out for shifts we missed from the day non-essential businesses had to closed. That means I will have one month of being paid around $200 (I am a student finishing so had to take time of for exams hence lack of hours). After the next two weeks are up, I will have 0 income, much like the rest of my workforce who can't apply for EI. Are we completely ineligible for CERB?

 Hazard/Danger pay Let's have a little Discussion here 

So grocery store workers are getting danger pay. 

Amazon workers gets danger pay. 

Yet my fiance who's an Registered Practical Nurse who's not getting the proper Personal Protective Equipment anymore does not get hazard/Danger pay and is expected to be there each day no matter how bad this gets.     

Like do we even care about our nurses. I see these posts saying about how grocery store workers are the firefighters of 9/11.   

What about our nurses that are keeping you and your family alive.  Nurses spend way more time with any patient than any doctor ever will. 

Let's give these poor nurses the respect, safety gear and pay they deserve.  I'm sick and tired hearing that nurses don't have a proper mask yet I see people on the street wearing them honestly WTF

 I used up my regular benefits at the start of lockdown and only started cerb a few weeks ago. Now they're saying my cerb is ending October 3rd and I should apply for my benefits. So I lost my job a few weeks before covid, got my EI  around the start of the year. When cerb started I contacted them and they said I had to complete using my regular benefits before I could get cerb

 So my ei ran out around the end of July and I switched over to cerb. I've been on it about 7 or 8 weeks and I just got an email saying my cerb is being cut off October 3rd and that I should apply to use my regular benefits, which I don't have because I used them up while everyone else was on cerb.

Anyone have any advice?

 Toll Free # to have 1 week waiting period to be Waived For EI Covid Applications Not working 
Tried calling the toll free number all i get is a busy-tone sound?. Been at it periodically every 15 mins for the last 3 hours. Im applying for ei sickness benefits due to being Quarantined. Please view description and link below for information: they are suppose to waive the 1 week waiting period. 

Off their page:
If you have already completed the application for EI sickness benefits whether you are sick or quarantined and would like to have the one-week waiting period waived, call the new toll-free phone number below. It is important to note that no other request will be actioned on this phone line. We will take action only for sick or quarantined clients affected by the COVID-19 for which the application for sickness benefits has been filed.

Telephone: 1-833-381-2725 (toll-free)



Still have to get my employers to submit an ROE if they already havent. I wont know until I get a Personal Access Code to My service canada since I didn’t have an account with them prior to this. If Anyone has begun receiving EI benefits due to quarantining or they are in same process please let me know and detail your experiences. Iv read directly from their website that payments dont start until about 28 days after you apply if you’re eligible and have submitted all required information. So if this telephone line starts to work then i will start getting paid in 21 days. So for the next 3 weeks Il have no income when this is the time its critical for most and if I finally get approved im lucky if I receive 55% of my weekly wages. This is the first time I applied for ei in my life I really hope that they approve compensation and backdate it for the 21 days you waited to hear back from them.

 Today millions of Canadian families received their Child Tax Benefit with no increase The Canadian Government missed today's deadline to increase the Child Tax Benefit by $300 per child. What this means is that barring some payment out of schedule families won't receive any increase in government assistance until April 20th. This is unacceptable for people who are struggling right now. 

While many may think there wasn't enough time to increase the payment for this month I find that extremely hard to believe. These payments are based on last years tax filing that began in July 2019. All the information is on file with the government. 

The next GST payment is scheduled to be deposited on April 3rd. It remains to be seen if they will get that increased in time.

 [Toronto Star]“70% of new infections are coming from the broader community” “Ontario’s regional health units are reporting another 24-hour period with more than 400 new COVID-19 cases as the rate of new infections has continued to rise in recent days, according to the Star’s latest count.

As of 11 a.m. Saturday, the health units had reported a total of 26,301 confirmed and probable cases, including 2,114 deaths.

The total of 475 new confirmed and probable cases reported since the same time Friday morning was once again up from recent daily averages, a sign the provincewide decline in infection rate has reversed in recent days.

Meanwhile, the recent increase in cases is now primarily coming from infections in the broader community outside outbreaks in places like seniors homes, according to a Star analysis based on data from Ontario’s hardest-hit health units. In mid-April, at the peak of infections in the province, most new case appeared in institutional outbreaks; since then, the rate of outbreak cases have fallen, and now about 70 per cent of new infections are coming in the broader community.

On Saturday morning, the province released its version of the same data, which showed the same trends.

The province once again reported another day in which testing labs completed far fewer COVID-19 tests than the target of 16,000 daily. The 11,028 tests completed the previous day was the sixth straight well below the target. The province says the labs have the capacity to complete about 20,000 tests daily; last week they completed as many as 18,354 in a day.

In the past, spikes in case counts have followed days with high testing rates, and vice versa for days of low testing.

The number of new cases reported each day had been on a downward trend since hitting a peak of more than 700 in late April. However, the average has begun to rise slightly after flattening out to about 360 cases per day last week; before this week, the province last saw more than 400 cases on May 8.

Meanwhile, the 24 fatal cases reported in the province since Friday morning was back in line with the recent falling trend. The rate of deaths is down considerably since peaking at more than 90 deaths in a day earlier this month, about two weeks after the peak in the daily case totals.”

 For the app, can I know WHEN I was exposed? It's important... I'm curious... Because if you were exposed 14 days prior to receiving the alert, it's quite a major difference than a few days (Someone could have been tested the same day they were 15 minutes next to you, and the results would be back 1-2 days later, in which you would get alert).

Between how many friends/acquaintances you would have to alert who spent time a decent amount of time with you even if you test negative, to how accurate the test will be (requires at least 5 or so days from exposure to be accurate). It makes a bit of difference...

If you were "Exposed in the last 14 days", but test negative, should I still cancel any plans I have because I may have been in contact too close to when I was tested?

What if we happen to get the 14 days warning every other week or so, because of public transit or whatnot (15 minute rides) and tests are told to be "Unreliable" because they should be taken 5 days after, but we don't know what day we were exposed... I'm not sure what to make of this.

 Question about crossing the border from the USA (family exemption) Hello all, 

I have a unique situation and I wanted to gather advice because I'm not sure where else to go.

My boyfriend is Canadian, we have a daughter that was born in the USA in Feb 2019. I live in the US with our daughter. We have submitted the paperwork for her Canadian citizenship card (she is a citizen by birth) however we have not received it yet. We both have US passports.

We are trying to cross the border and spend 2 months in Canada with her father. However, with the borders being closed we are not sure if we will be allowed. I have read about the family exemption. I sent an email according to what was posted to ask for advice almost 2 weeks ago and have not received anything back.

Since my daughter is a citizen and her father is Canadian, I don't think she would have a problem crossing. I, on the other hand, am only a US citizen. I'm not sure if I fall into the immediate family category to be allowed entry. It will be a 6 hour drive for us to the border, and I don't want to make that and be turned away.

Can anyone direct me to a phone number or provide advice on whether I would be allowed entry?

 EI and CERB mixup overpaid? I was one of the people who had their work shut down March 16th and applied for EI Benefits. My claim with EI is still considered "under review" on MSCA. A Co-worker in the same position as me called last week to ask if we would have to reapply under CERB since our class hadn't been approved and whoever they spoke to said yes. So I applied to CERB on Monday as well. Now I seem to have been paid the CERB $2000 amounts twice today. 

I'm assuming this means the information I got was incorrect, there's just been so much back and forth floating around in went with whatever info we given to my co-worker by a government employee when they called. 

When I call them in the morning will they be able to reverse one of those payments or will I be able to pay back the overpayment? 

I'm a very anxious person so just having the money in my account right now when it's not mine is stressing me out.

Anyone else experience this?

 [MEGATHREAD] CERB Benefits Program Discussion thread and information #[What is the Canada Emergency Response Benefit](

&gt; If you have stopped working because of COVID-19, the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) may provide you with temporary income support. The CERB provides $500 a week for up to 16 weeks.

#Who is eligible
The Benefit is available to workers:

* Residing in Canada, who are at least 15 years old;
* Who have stopped working because of reasons related to COVID-19 or are eligible for Employment Insurance regular or sickness benefits or have exhausted their Employment Insurance regular benefits between December 29, 2019 and October 3, 2020;
* Who had employment and/or self-employment income of at least $5,000 in 2019 or in the 12 months prior to the date of their application; and,
* Who have not quit their job voluntarily.
* When submitting your first claim, you cannot have earned more than $1,000 in employment and/or self-employment income for 14 or more consecutive days within the four-week benefit period of your claim.

[CERB expanded to some who ran out of EI, part-timers and seasonal workers]( 

&gt; The CERB will become available to Canadians who have exhausted their employment insurance (EI) benefits since Jan. 1, seasonal workers who can’t find work because of COVID-19 and those who earn up to $1,000 a month, the prime minister said.

[Canadians receiving the CERB must re-apply to continue receiving benefits](

&gt; Canadians who applied for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit for the first four weeks it was available will need to reapply if they want to continue receiving payments.

 No CERB payment after a week of waiting... I applied for CERB back on Monday April 6th and still have not received payment. I am under the impression it is supposed to take 3-5 business days (according to Trudeau). The thing is, even with the Federal holiday of Friday the 10th and Monday the 13th, my payment should have come in today.... I have applied for direct deposit but am wondering if maybe the money is sitting somewhere else waiting to be deposited into my account, and can’t because this whole direct deposit thing seemed to be rushed.

 Why do underage kids qualify for CERB when they still live at home? CERB site says you must be at least 15 to get paid.  So... Why do underage kids need 2K a month when their parents pay the rent and buy all the groceries?  Are we seriously putting underage kids before unemployed people when it comes to benefit packages?  If you are underage and living with your parents there is ZERO reason you need emergency benefits.  People who need money and have kids will already qualify for child tax benefits and those received a substantial boost.  Every single teenager who lives with their parents or family members who receives CERB should be paying it back or not taking it in the first place.

 Apply For EI Now Or Wait For CERB Portal? I know, another topic about EI/CERB.

I was laid off a little over a week ago, and have been trying to find some kind of definitive answer about whether EI applications will automatically be applied for CERB once the portal is open? Or would I have to apply again for CERB once it's available? Or will I be just stuck with the standard EI benefits if I apply too early?

Also, I registered for a CRA account this morning and it said it would mail out my access code before I can fully access my account. Mail has been understandably delayed lately, so will I have to wait for that to apply for it anyway? I've never applied for EI or anything through there, and this is all just super confusing to me. 

Any insight would be greatly appreciated!
