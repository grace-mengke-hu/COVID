 Speculation of lockdown. My last post got removed from the moderators. I get it, I understand. I have a stupid name but I made the account just now to help you guys. I got the info from a real insider source that the lockdown will be announced 1 PM via Justin Trudeau and last until April 5th. BUT, I dont want to get this post shut down so lets make it a discussion post about lockdowns in general. Do you think it will happen?

These new restrictions are to take effect  starting at 12:01 a.m. Friday, and are partly directed at those "big box" stores who have been planning Black Friday sales. Jewelry, flowers, perfume, consumer electronics, sporting equipment, books and toys  are among the items listed as non-essential goods.

 When moderation become censorship ex. r/Coronavirus Lately i have came across a number of post that were in my opinion unusefully moderated on r/Coronavirus. Lets keep in mind that r/Coronavirus is by its name the main hub for coronavirus and should not be limited. This hub limit politics while it should not. For example r/CoronavirusPolitics should limit itself to only politics if it desire to do so, not the main hub. We know that when searching for coronavirus on reddit one of the first to appear is going to be r/Coronavirus, so if most user go to this hub and it is censored, then user will have a limited sources of information. In that case r/Coronavirus should honestly be renamed r/Coronaviruscensored.

I am interested in everyone opinions and unless downright encouraging violence i think nothing should be moderated. Let the public decide what is worthy to read or not, similar to the way economics works.

Since these post have been censored, removed, lock, and moderation pinned, we have no way to tell what have been moderated and if it needed to be moderated.

In some instance the moderator will simply delete anything that does not have the share the same view as the W.H.O., what a limited view.

We live in what is suppose to be a free speech society, but i don't see it happening.

Any of us should be able to choose what we read and believe or not, and we do not need a "big brother" type of moderation or moderation at all.

Lets not forget that if any moderator of a group of moderators decide to remove posts or comment they can do without the approval of other moderators. Because of this system a lot can be moderated without being voted as such, it is very limiting to free speech.

Here is an example of such post that has 56k up vote, i think the number of vote show the interest user have in it, and i cannot understand how it ended up being locked and censored by a single person.

I wonder about the real credential of moderators, some pose as virologist but how can we verify this. And even if one was a verified scientific, his or her moderation is also only a form of opinion because no one knows everything.

How would we know that some propaganda agents would not have infiltrate moderation circles?

**I encourage all of you to post example of bad moderation and censorship.**

Lets work together to make reddit a free speech platform.

 How will covid19 change things? I post on my blog that I think the trend will be to be isolated, to have fun, even making money from home, even when the pandemic is over.

But this is just my perspective, what major changes do you think will happen after the pandemic?  


For those curious this is the post:

 What would happen if we didn't take any action against COVID 19? I have been talking with a friend who turns out to be a "just the flu bro" kind of person. They said something along the lines of "why can't we just let the virus run its course?"

Out of curiosity, what do you think would happen if we continued economic activity as usual and didn't change anything?

Sure hospitals would be overwhelmed but what is the logical conclusion to that? If Canada decided "let's let the virus run its course", would we even be able to maintain societal and economic functions?
