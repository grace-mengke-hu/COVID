 Half of Ontarians don't expect life to return to normal for at least six months: poll results 

More than four in 10 Canadians now believe that life won’t return to normal for at least six months with those living in Ontario among the most pessimistic, a new poll has found.

The Angus Reid Institute survey of 4,240 Canadians found that 43 per cent of all respondents do not believe that life will return “back to normal” for at least six months with that number rising to 50 per cent among Ontario residents. Meanwhile, about 41 per cent of respondents said that they felt life would return to normal within three to six months while 14 per cent said they hoped for some return to normalcy in a month or two. The remaining two per cent of respondents said that they expected life to return to normal in the coming weeks.

The numbers represent a significant shift from a similar poll that Angus Reid conducted between March 13 and 15 when restrictions were first being placed on public life. At that time only 30 per cent said that they didn’t expect life to return to normal for six months or more and 31 per cent said they expected some return to normalcy in a few months or less.

The data also reveals that age may be a factor in how Canadians view the COVID-19 pandemic.

Of those 55-years-old and up, 47 per cent of them believe that life won’t be able to return to normal for six months or more compared to 36 per cent among those between the ages of 18 and 34. Education also played a role with 49 per cent of respondents who have completed at least some university indicating that they don’t expect things to return to normal for six months or more. That number drops to 40 per cent among those with only a high school education.

In terms of what they will do when life returns to normal and restrictions on in-person interactions are lifted, Canadians are split.

The Angus Reid Institute survey found that 45 per cent of respondents listed hugging friends and family as the thing they were most looking forward to while 34 per cent said reconnecting with people and 31 per cent said going to a bar or restaurant. Going back to the office (16 per cent), going on vacation (16 per cent), going shopping (11 per cent), going to the gym (nine per cent) and watching live sports (seven per cent) were also popular answers.

Gender was a factor in some of the responses with women more likely to express a desire to hug family and friends (55 per cent) than men (33 per cent). Men, however, expressed a stronger desire to go to a restaurant or bar (35 per cent) than women (27 per cent)

The poll is considered accurate to within two percentage points, 19 times out of 20.

 Wage Subsidy Application Question Hey All,

In the process of trying to apply for the Wage Subsidy for my business and employees. I've just a couple of questions:

1) Currently, the site says you can apply online through the myBusinessCRA account portal and to register for a business CRA account. I do have a PERSONAL CRA account, but no formal business CRA account. 

\-To register for a myBusinessCRA account, can I just login with my PERSONAL CRA username and password and add my business from there, or do I have to create a NEW CRA Business account separate from my personal one? Currently, I'm still awaiting the CRA code to be sent to my house so I can't see any options after the initial login screen unfortunately.

2) Is the wage subsidy program currently open for applications? The site shows eligibility periods however, since I am unable to actually get through my CRA account without the code, I can't see if it's actually open. Plus, there are news articles and the site says "information to be announced." Please let me know so I can try and expedite the code so I don't miss the eligibility window for March-April.

Thank you!!

 Trudeau just said if you don't have any symptoms, you don't have to get tested and you're not contagious. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. One of the most dangerous statements Trudeau could have made today during his statement to Ottawa and the country today. Please inform those around you that YES you CAN spread it even if you don't have symptoms.

He's undoing what we've all been trying to stop!

 Toronto hospital to open coronavirus screening centre at medical office in East York 

A Toronto hospital says it is planning on opening a coronavirus screening centre to test for COVID-19 at a medical building in the city’s east end.


Michael Garron Hospital said it anticipates the COVID-19 Community Assessment Centre will open in mid-March at 840 Coxwell Ave., which is just across the street from the hospital.

The hospital said patients will be screened for symptoms as well as travel and contact history upon arrival at the centre. There will be a separate entrance for these screenings from the rest of the building, which will still be providing its regular medical services.

After screenings, the patient will be assessed by a doctor or nurse and tested for COVID-19, if the assessment indicates it’s needed, the hospital said.

 Tracking the virus spread through Canada It has come up in a few discussions that people are looking to track the spread of Covid-19 cases through Canada. This CTV site tracks and makes notes on the cases thus far and breaks down the Canadian data overall and by province. This is Canadian data only and does not mention global statistics. 

As of this morning this site shows:

 **CANADA**

Canadian deaths: 8

Provinces and territories with positive or presumptive cases: 10 (British Columbia, Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador)

51 per cent are female

31 per cent are over the age of 60

13 per cent have been hospitalized

74 per cent of cases are travellers, and six per cent are people in close contact with travellers

The majority of cases were travellers or those who were in close contact with those who were recently in: Austria, Britain, China, Costa Rica, Egypt, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Iran, Italy, Jordan, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Panama, the Philippines, Spain, Taiwan, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkey, Ukraine, United States (Florida, Las Vegas, Oregon, Puerto Rico, Seattle, Washington State), cruise ships (Diamond Princess, Grand Princess, MS Braemar)

 I just got the CERB but didn't apply. So I was checking my bank account this morning and saw that a 2000$ EFT had just mysteriously appeared in my account even though I haven't applied for it.  I did apply for the 200$ from the Ontario Gov't for kids daycare but that was all.  It wasn't even in the account that I usually get my tax return deposited.  Don't get my wrong, I'm very grateful for the cash but I'm worried that it might have been in error and I'll be penalized somehow.  Has this happened to anyone else?

 intensive animal farming and human health impact from the wiki 

According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), farms on which animals are intensively reared can cause adverse health reactions in farm workers. Workers may develop acute and chronic lung disease, musculoskeletal injuries, and may catch infections that transmit from animals to human beings (such as tuberculosis).[67]

Pesticides are used to control organisms which are considered harmful[68] and they save farmers money by preventing product losses to pests.[69] In the US, about a quarter of pesticides used are used in houses, yards, parks, golf courses, and swimming pools[70] and about 70% are used in agriculture.[69] However, pesticides can make their way into consumers' bodies which can cause health problems. One source of this is bioaccumulation in animals raised on factory farms.[70][71][72]

"Studies have discovered an increase in respiratory, neurobehavioral, and mental illnesses among the residents of communities next to factory farms."[73]

The CDC writes that chemical, bacterial, and viral compounds from animal waste may travel in the soil and water. Residents near such farms report problems such as unpleasant smell, flies and adverse health effects.[34]

The CDC has identified a number of pollutants associated with the discharge of animal waste into rivers and lakes, and into the air. Antibiotic use in livestock may create antibiotic-resistant pathogens; parasites, bacteria, and viruses may be spread; ammonia, nitrogen, and phosphorus can reduce oxygen in surface waters and contaminate drinking water; pesticides and hormones may cause hormone-related changes in fish; animal feed and feathers may stunt the growth of desirable plants in surface waters and provide nutrients to disease-causing micro-organisms; trace elements such as arsenic and copper, which are harmful to human health, may contaminate surface waters.[34]

Intensive farming may make the evolution and spread of harmful diseases easier. Many communicable animal diseases spread rapidly through densely spaced populations of animals and crowding makes genetic reassortment more likely. However, small family farms are more likely to introduce bird diseases and more frequent association with people into the mix, as happened in the 2009 flu pandemic[74]

In the European Union, growth hormones are banned on the basis that there is no way of determining a safe level. The UK has stated that in the event of the EU raising the ban at some future date, to comply with a precautionary approach, it would only consider the introduction of specific hormones, proven on a case by case basis.[75] In 1998, the European Union banned feeding animals antibiotics that were found to be valuable for human health. Furthermore, in 2006 the European Union banned all drugs for livestock that were used for growth promotion purposes. As a result of these bans, the levels of antibiotic resistance in animal products and within the human population showed a decrease.[76][77]

The international trade in animal products increases the risk of global transmission of virulent diseases such as swine fever,[78] BSE, foot and mouth and bird flu.

In the United States, the use of antibiotics in livestock is still prevalent. The FDA reports that 80 percent of all antibiotics sold in 2009 were administered to livestock animals, and that many of these antibiotics are identical or closely related to drugs used for treating illnesses in humans. Consequently, many of these drugs are losing their effectiveness on humans, and the total healthcare costs associated with drug-resistant bacterial infections in the United States are between $16.6 billion and $26 billion annually.[79]

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has been identified in pigs and humans raising concerns about the role of pigs as reservoirs of MRSA for human infection. One study found that 20% of pig farmers in the United States and Canada in 2007 harbored MRSA.[80] A second study revealed that 81% of Dutch pig farms had pigs with MRSA and 39% of animals at slaughter carried the bug were all of the infections were resistant to tetracycline and many were resistant to other antimicrobials.[81] A more recent study found that MRSA ST398 isolates were less susceptible to tiamulin, an antimicrobial used in agriculture, than other MRSA or methicillin susceptible S. aureus.[82] Cases of MRSA have increased in livestock animals. CC398 is a new clone of MRSA that has emerged in animals and is found in intensively reared production animals (primarily pigs, but also cattle and poultry), where it can be transmitted to humans. Although dangerous to humans, CC398 is often asymptomatic in food-producing animals.[83]

A 2011 nationwide study reported nearly half of the meat and poultry sold in U.S. grocery stores – 47 percent – was contaminated with S. aureus, and more than half of those bacteria – 52 percent – were resistant to at least three classes of antibiotics.[84] Although Staph should be killed with proper cooking, it may still pose a risk to consumers through improper food handling and cross-contamination in the kitchen. The senior author of the study said, "The fact that drug-resistant S. aureus was so prevalent, and likely came from the food animals themselves, is troubling, and demands attention to how antibiotics are used in food-animal production today."[85]

In April 2009, lawmakers in the Mexican state of Veracruz accused large-scale hog and poultry operations of being breeding grounds of a pandemic swine flu, although they did not present scientific evidence to support their claim. A swine flu which quickly killed more than 100 infected persons in that area, appears to have begun in the vicinity of a Smithfield subsidiary pig CAFO (concentrated animal feeding operation).[86]

 Coronavirus questions: Can I hug a friend? We want to hug, so much that it might cross the safety line.

"I would tell most people: just because places are opening, does not mean the virus is under control," Dr Abraar Karan, physician and public health researcher at Harvard Medical School tells the BBC.

"The virus is still out there," he says. And every social interaction is an opportunity for the virus to catch and spread.

Can we hug each other briefly if we are wearing masks?

"This is a virus that's not going to go anywhere," says Dr Amesh Adalja, a senior researcher in infectious disease and pandemic preparedness at Johns Hopkins University. "I don't think the solution is not to hug anybody."

Echoing Dr Karan and Dr Marcus, Dr Adalja stresses that the risks and benefits for any social interaction during this period will look different for every person. "For certain individuals, the benefit is going to outweigh the risk," Dr Adalja says. People embrace during the coronavirus pandemic on May 29, 2020 in New York City

Dr Karan is slightly more cautious. "I'm not saying 'don't hug your friends,'" he says. "But again: close contact is close contact. Minimising close contact is important right now." And if you decide to break the 6ft barrier, wearing a mask "very likely and significantly" reduces the rate of transmission, he says, meaning face coverings are a smart harm reduction strategy.
