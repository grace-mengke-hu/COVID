 Le StuDio Interview on Our COVID Response - how the Ontario Government handled the healthcare system 

&gt;Great interview today with Le StuDio as we explored both Ontario’s and Quebec’s response to COVID-19. We ask some hard questions; Did the actions of our governments result in thousands of early deaths in long-term care homes? Does the government’s response and continued lockdowns constitute criminal negligence? These are all important questions we must ask all our representatives as further, harsher restrictions are on the horizon, and the further closures of our small businesses.

This video discusses how Ontario hospitals transferred hundreds of patients into already crowded long term care homes. Long term care patients were not being accepted by the hospitals for treatment. The hospital emergency rooms were emptier than usual. It also touches on how Québec staff panicked. Private clinical doctors offered to help and step in, but the government declined and chose to send in the army instead.

 Airbnb asks government to bail out hosts in Canada due to Covid &amp;#x200B;

Is this really what Canada has come to?  Mega companies who never paid taxes and made life harder for Canadians now want us to bail  out their shady business practices. Socialism for the rich, hard austerity capitalism for the rest of us.

"Airbnb is asking the government to make employment benefits available to Airbnb hosts.

Airbnb also wants the government to defer sales taxes for short term rentals.

 We'll be social distancing for 18 months-2 years. For those that are "Waiting it out" &amp; don't have a "Long-term" game plan, it's time to make one. Start brain storming. We're lucky that our government gave us realistic predictions, so we can plan ahead. Better to have a plan and not need it, then to not have a plan and need it.

Apr. 3: Ontario releases pandemic predictions

Ontario could see between 3,000 to 15,000 deaths related to COVID-19, according to provincial modelling. Without government intervention to order people to stay at home, the toll could have been 100,000 deaths. According to Dr. Peter Donnelly of Public Health Ontario, the outbreak will likely continue for 18 months to two years, and the province is “some way off” from lifting physical distancing measures, especially in densely populated areas.

 Canadian governments refusing to release models or projections of COVID-19 spread  

Ontario Premier Doug Ford said releasing projection models might prompt panic.

“There are a few different models and if we give one or the other it sends two different messages,” said Ford. “These models could drastically, drastically change. If we underestimate on one side and overestimate on the other (it could) create a panic if we overestimate.”

When asked about releasing information from such models, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said, “There are a wide range of projections depending on how Canadians are behaving.”

 To the Media. Whats is our COVID-19 Testing capabilities? Seeing  the debate in the United States concerning testing kits availability, i am appalled that our media do not ask more about our testing capability against covid-19.

To my latest understanding, Vancouver and Toronto as well as Calgary do not rely anymore on the  National Microbiology Laboratory (NML). Also the Canadian governments report only 642 tested cases to this date. 

See: [

If possible could anybody direct me to a source of information on how many tests were done in Canada (Daily updated sources only PLZ).

Also i could anybody direct me to a source stating what are our testing capabilities? (Most updated if possible)

Failing that, i am turning to the media to bring light on this issue. For what is on the medias mind, is on the public mind and our leaders as well. Let's be informed.

 The Authority &amp; Governments Are Making Many Big Mistakes Over The Corona Virus COVID-19 NCOV **The Authority &amp; Governments Are Making Many Big Mistakes Over The Corona Virus COVID-19 NCOV**

I just want to tell the hard truth so hopefully they can change for the better, or otherwise many nations will disappear because of this corona virus for sure.

Here are the big mistakes of many big international groups &amp; national governments:

**1. Censorship**  
 If you cannot face the truth and tell the real problems, but only cover/hide it and expect it will “miracle go away”, then you would utterly wrong.  
 

First, the China covered it up, that is why is spread worldwide.  
 Second, the Western Government covered it up as well, they censored all kind of theory about this virus online. That is why their citizens did not fear and now is crazy deadly situation after the corona virus fully touch down their land.

**2. Underestimate, Do Not Respect The New Corona Virus NCOV**  
 I have said and warned the dangerous of this virus, but all of you were deleted my only text-base theory post. Now it turned out it all the fact and hard truth.

**If any scientist and/or authority, government can prove my theory about this corona virus is wrong, I would close my websites instantly !!!**

**3. Listening False Prophets Instead Of The Savior**  
 Many secret societies and governments know what the hex are they doing, many of them are listening to false prophet/fortune teller, etc. Instead of facing the hard truth.

I as the savior will never play encrypt message, only a direct straight forward communication.

You have more chance to survive if you listen to any entities can tell “have cure/solution” for the problems instead of rely on “safe choice” who only tell you “try, not sure it work”.

That are the 3 big major mistakes the authorities are making, if they do not change, then they will collapse and die because of this corona virus NCOV for sure.

The rich the elite, government officials will gone first for ignore the savior Messiah, then latter to the poor.

Hopefully, they can wake up and change for the better.

Best Regard,  
 **The Savior**

 Trudeau wants to exhaust all options Canada wide before emergency act could be implemented. So until most of us get infected or die, our federal government would just sit and combat this unpredictable spread, step by step. 

I can’t believe we have a government that’s ready to see some of us dead than implement a swift action plan. Countries like India where the health care system is next to terrible are implementing social distancing and mandatory closures across all sectors to avoid the spread. Take it in that their infection is in the low hundreds. Canada on the other hand is waiting alongside its American compatriots. Oh Canada :(

 Ontario releasing "detailed" data relating to cases and death projections tomorrow afternoon No link yet, but Doug Ford just stated this during his daily presser.

I'm hoping this will provide a lot of clarity and understanding to citizens for better or worse; pretty astonishing how upfront the US/Trump has been with this data but Trudeau has kept it all under wraps.  No more secrets and vague words, time for us to see the data once and for all.

According to him, these won't be enacted right away, but ""within days" since government is slow to react... or to not to create mass panic by enforcing all of them at once.

 Some sourced tips for life in a pandemic 
Sourced Tips for Living in a Pandemic

So i fixed that email that people are getting upset about. I have removed anything that is not factual and sourced the information. So next time you see something claiming to be from John Hopkins, you can refer to this instead. Some good tips for daily life in a Pandemic

this is NOT medical or legal advice  


* The virus is not a living organism, but is a RNA virus with a lipid envelope containing surface proteins, which, when absorbed by the cells of the ocular, nasal or buccal mucosa, changes their genetic code. (mutation) and convert them into aggressor and multiplier cells. [source]( 
 
* Since the virus is not a living organism but a protein molecule, it is not killed, but decays on its own. The disintegration time depends on the temperature, humidity and type of material where it lies. [source]( 
 
* The virus is very fragile; the only thing that protects it is a thin outer layer of fat. That is why any soap or detergent is the best remedy, because the soap CUTS the FAT (that is why you have to rub so much: for 20 seconds or more. [source ]( 
 
By dissolving the fat layer, the protein molecule disperses and breaks down on its own. [source ](
 
* HEAT melts fat; this is why it is so good to use water above 25 degrees Celsius for washing hands, clothes and everything. [source ](
 
* Alcohol or any mixture with alcohol over 70% DISSOLVES ANY FAT, especially the external lipid layer of the virus. [source]( 
 
* Any mix with 1 part bleach and NINE parts water directly dissolves the protein, breaks it down from the inside. be careful when mixing bleach and do so in well ventilated area. DO NOT DRINK [source]( 
 
 
* BACTERICIDE AND ANTIBIOTICS ARE NOT EFFECTIVE. Naturally occurring antibodies can recognize and respond to threats in the body but taking antibiotics is not effective against virus [source]( 
 
* NEVER shake used or unused clothing, sheets or cloth. While it is glued to a porous surface, it is very inert and disintegrates only
-between 3 hours (fabric and porous),
-4 hours (copper and wood)
-24 hours (cardboard),
- 42 hours (metal) and
-72 hours (plastic).
But if you shake it or use a feather duster, the virus molecules float in the air for up to 3 hours, and can lodge in your nose.  [source ]( 

* VACUUM OFTEN. Use a HEPA filter to avoid blowing the particles back into [source]( 
 
* The virus molecules remain very stable in external cold, or artificial as air conditioners in houses and cars. [source]( 
 
They also need moisture to stay stable, and especially darkness. Therefore, dehumidified, dry, warm and bright environments will degrade it faster. [source]( 
 
* Stanford University Researchers have discovered that exposing contaminated mask to heat for duration sanitizes them. N95 respirators have been successfully cleaned by baking them at 158F° (70C°) for 30 minutes. dials can be inconsistent use a thermometer! [source]( 
 
* The virus CANNOT go through healthy skin. [source]( 
 
* Vinegar is NOT useful because it does not break down the protective layer of fat. [source ]( 
 
* NO SPIRITS, NOR VODKA, kill virus. most vodka is 40% alcohol, and you need 70%. [source]( 
 
* Most mouthwashes are not effective at killing virus. Most of them are ~21% alchohol. LISTERINE Antiseptic is guaranteed to kill 99.9% of plaque causing bacteria, but will not destroy the virus. It should not be used to clean surfaces with [source]( 
 
* The more confined the space, the more concentration of the virus there can be. The more open or naturally ventilated, the less. [source]( 
 
* You have to wash your hands before and after touching mucosa, food, locks, knobs, switches, remote control, cell phone, watches, computers, desks, TV, etc. And when using the bathroom. [source ]( 

* You have to HUMIDIFY your hands after they become dry from frequent washing. dry hands can crack and virons can remain deep in these hard to reach microcracks. to HUMIDIFY hands dab them dry with a towel and then use cream or lotion [source](

 
* Also keep your NAILS SHORT so that the virus does not hide there. [source ]( 

EDIT: WEAR MASK FOR OTHERS [source](

EDIT #2: SHOP SOLO. DONT TAKE YOUR CHILDREN with you to the store. If you NEED someone to help you shop limit it to them; no spouse/flat mate/ pals   [source](

 Review of media outlets and best sources for TV news? Hoping this topic is ok. I'm struggling with figuring out who to trust. Yesterday was "Super Tuesday" and that topic, on Canada news, basically trumped (no pun intended) many other stories.

I was wondering if we could discuss sources you're finding better than others and why. My take (I'm in Toronto)

\&gt; Al jazeera - pretty solid global info, limited Canadian

\&gt; BBC World - also solid coverage but limited Canadian

\&gt; Global News (especially on YouTube) - seems to be covering nearly as much as CNBC, pretty impressed actually

\&gt; CP24 - repeating tidbits of good-news stories, constantly saying China cases plateauing, have economic experts and guests who think interest rates are going to make things better (today anyways)

\&gt; CBC - they have better coverage on this topic, even had a 1-hour special taking questions and having experts, but often just recurring loop of info

\&gt; CTV National News (Lisa LaFlamme) - SO tired of the spin, smiley stories, and playing things like songs and people washing their hands. Lisa has frankly lost my confidence on this one and I DO normally respect her and her team

\&gt; CTV Toronto - decent local updates 2x/day 

\&gt; CTVNews - have noticed they very often miss breaking news and conferences

&amp;#x200B;

Bringing this up not so much to slag anyone (sorry for that) as to see who you're finding more worth following for most trustworthy frank coverage.

 Tucker Carlson reported tonight on a report by Chinese scientists that has had virtually no attention since it was released 2 months ago. Chinese scientists determined the most likely cause of the pandemic was a horseshoe bat from a chinese biolab. The chinese government lied since the start. New reporting tonight from Tucker Carlson. He brings to light a paper by chinese scientists released 2 months ago that has received virtually no attention. Chinese scientists apparently concluded that the most likely source of the coronavirus was from a horseshoe bat. Horseshoe bats are definitely not sold at Wuhan market as per interviews with dozens of regular customers at the market. There are actually two chinese biolabs merely hundreds of yards from the Wuhan market. Horseshoe bats are not known to be found naturally within hundreds of miles of these biolabs and market. Evidence suggested a chinese scientist was exposed to coronavirus from the urine and blood of a Horseshoe bat they were experimenting with at one of the biolabs.

1. China lied about the source of pandemic to cover up the governments / scientists mistake
2. China keeps its level 4 biolabs in densely populated areas in Wuhan- a stupid idea for obvious reasons. Now we have a pandemic, likely due to an inept scientist who was exposed to horseshoe bat urine &amp; blood then spread it to the local community. China will likely move its biolabs after this incident to prevent it occurring again.
3. China has the WHO leaders in its pocket and the WHO is endlessly praising the communist regime, praising their response and claiming the communist regime is a model for transparency. They are trying to rewrite history to claim they were transparent and honest from the start when we know they were not. Pandemic models have shown if they had acted as little as ONE WEEK sooner the level of infection spread could have been 66% lower.

Im pretty shocked and disgusted that this is all the chinese governments fault and they are trying to cover it up. Still, no surprise here whatsoever.

Just a heads up, this multi-part question.  
I live in an apartment building with many seniors. I want to help my community more so I would like to offer to pick up groceries for some of my elderly and at-risk neighbours when I go to the store. 

1. a) What are some steps I can take to ensure I bring them back their groceries safely?   
b) Should I be going as far as sterilizing the packages/whatever I bring back before presenting it to them?
2. I have hand sanitizer and masks that I would wear, are there any other steps I can take to ensure I don't contract and pass on the virus?

 Threat: Coronavirus or Global Recession Based on available data, in spite of mainstream media sources, it appears that Coronavirus is mild in the vast majority of cases, and affects specifically elderly people and those with underlying health issues. 

In any given flu season we all take common sense precautions to curb the rate of infection among the elderly and immune compromised. Social distancing, health alerts, and basic hygiene have been the norm for decades, and could be considered common sense. We all accept the collateral damage caused by flu pandemics. 

Does it really make sense to grind the global economy to a hault, and to then promise hundreds of billions in stimulus?

Is the nation not already in debt? Additionally, printing money devalues the savings of everyone. Interest rates are already supremely low. The government earns it's revenue through income tax and tax on goods and services. If the government grinds the economy to a hault, and is already in debt, cannot print money or lower interest rates, and is promising hundreds of billions of dollars to pop out of thin air... Does this not sound absurd?

I'm an economist, an investor, and I have a background in psychology. 

Please help me see where I'm incorrect.
