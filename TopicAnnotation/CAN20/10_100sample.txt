 Any healthcare workers care to share their experiences? Like what's the general attitude and view of your colleagues? And is there any plan behind the scenes to take care of this? Are they at least preparing?

 COVID-19 in long-term care homes in Ontario and British Columbia Key Points:
â€¢ Many more residents living in Ontario long-term care homes have died from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) than in British Columbia.
â€¢ During the first wave of the pandemic, British Columbia was faster than Ontario in responding to COVID-19, with actions to address public health support, staffing, and infection prevention and control.
â€¢ Leaders in British Columbia were more decisive, coordinated and consistent in their overall communication and response.
â€¢ Before the pandemic, the long-term care system in British Columbia exhibited a number of potential strengths relevant to pandemic preparedness compared with Ontario: there was better coordination between long-term care, public health and hospitals; greater funding of long-term care; more care hours for residents; fewer shared rooms; more nonprofit facility ownership; and more comprehensive inspections.

 WHO still says it can be stopped, not just slowed [

&gt;We have never before seen a pandemic sparked by a #coronavirus.   And we have never before seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time.

[

&gt;Of the 118,000 #COVID19 cases reported globally in 114 countries, more than 90 percent of cases are in just four countries, and two of those â€“ ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³ and ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡· - have significantly declining epidemics.

[

&gt;We cannot say this loudly enough, or clearly enough, or often enough: all countries can still change the course of this pandemic.

[

&gt;Even those countries with community transmission or large clusters can turn the tide on this #coronavirus.  
&gt;  
&gt;Several countries have demonstrated that this virus can be suppressed and controlled.

[

&gt;The challenge for many countries who are now dealing with large #COVID19 clusters or community transmission is not whether they can do the same â€“ itâ€™s whether they will.

Please stop with this claim that the virus can no longer be stopped. It can. South Korea's outbreak got far worse than ours, and they stopped it. If we believe we can't, that may become a self-fulfilling prophecy.

 Prescription refills available in BC without visiting doctor: 

â€œWe have worked with the College of Pharmacists to advise pharmacies to provide patients with a prescription refill or an emergency supply of their medications if needed. This will give physicians more time to care for patients with acute care needs. British Columbians are asked to respect this temporary arrangement and are reminded that there is no need to stockpile medication.

 South Korea was doing a fantastic job of controlling #COVIDãƒ¼19 for the first 30 patients. Then #Patient31 came along, did not adhere to social distancing and caused 2 clusters that were responsible for 80% of South Korea's infections. Don't be #Patient31.

 Shoppers Drug Mart people limit?? Our local Shoppers Drug Mart (Halifax, NS), did not have a people limit in it yesterday.  The pharmacy line had the floor marked off for separation in lineups , but just wondering if the # of people limit does not apply to them?

 Force grocery stores to click &amp; collect / drive and collect ? Wouldn't it make sense to force the grocery stores to a click and collect style model? for the time being.

Have all the workers simply pick the orders and bring them out to the cars for people, Also if people don't do click and collect drive up and call in their list and have it picked and brought out?

It would work in 2 fold reduces the risk to the workers and reduces the risk to the public, just thinking out loud. There doesn't seem to be enough spots availability for click and collect in Mississauga stores forcing us to go into the stores.
