 I want to volunteer. What are my options? I’m young, healthy, and want to contribute. I’m seeing all these headlines about staff shortages in the healthcare infrastructure; there must be something I can do. The issue is I have an immuno-compromised mother that I don’t want to risk... Is there like a public volunteer program that would provide boarding if I work at a hospital? I thought Americorps would have such an org but haven’t seen anything.

 If you were on vacation when everything shut down are you stuck there? Say you were on vacation a month ago in Hawaii. Are you forced to stay there and live in the hotel (not that would be a bad thing of course)?

 Plan for funding the relief bill: federal fines for defying bans. A Taiwanese man was just fined $33K for defying the quarantine to go to a nightclub. If the US government would just start fining businesses and individuals for not self-quarantining and following the government-mandated rules, we could at least defray some of the astronomic cost of the goddamned bill.

 My mother is a trooper for going to work everyday. NY Nurses are to be applauded My mother works on a nursing floor as a nurse manager in a suburb of New York, she has been going to work and having to listen to all this horrible news and dealing with patients who are infected first hand. 

Today a nurse that she works with who is in his seventies got infected with the virus and is currently on a ventilator. He was working day and night and sleeping at this hospital to make sure these COVID patients were cared for and had someone to look after he had his N95 on pretty much all the time and my mother was confused to how he got infected. She is scared to go to work tomorrow because she fears becoming infected, she puts on her scrubs everyday and heads straight into the storm anyway. The nurses and doctors in these hospitals are completely selfless. Although many of my mothers nurses are strongly refusing to work with the Patients. 

They are unsung hero’s here in NY

They should be praised for the work they are doing to keep everyone healthy. The least you could do is STAY INSIDE FOR THE SAKE OF HEALTH CARE WORKERS.
