 Why a sudden apparent drop in death rate? Looking at the COVID data, it seems like the rate of death is dropping fairly dramatically. Graph is weekly cases and deaths. 

Why the drop off in deaths / week as a % of previous week's new cases? 

It's not due to catching cases earlier (increasing the time between new case and death) because we see a lack of correlation over &gt;30 days.

It's also not explainable due to "poor initial testing"-- at current death rates, that would imply we were having \~1.8M new cases a week in April, which is absurd imo.

It's not likely due to data issues, counting new cases &amp; counting death methodology is consistent across this timeline.

Does the infected population suddenly skew far younger / healthier, implying we're doing a significantly better job protecting at risk populations? Are we better at treating this? 

Then the really interesting question... do revised death rates bolster the case for curtailing social distancing or is social distancing responsible for new death rates?

 Prediction of cases and deaths. Future cases and deaths. We have less around a month to until we reach heard immunity. (Confirmed cases today: 1,750,000 and 100,000 deaths.  Real cases today: 136,470,697 Real deaths today: 351,000 deaths. 5/30/20.) (Based off uptick in flu deaths 6 states + covid deaths) (Cases 27,000,000. 5/13/20.) (Two weeks cases= 300,000,000 deaths= 1,774,119 6/14/20) (Four weeks cases=max deaths=3,900,000 6/30/20 max deaths 5% death rate= 15,000,000)

I know 5 people with it already personally.

 Anyone want to check my math?  

Current Death Rate:

Per a number of sources the current death rate of people infected world wide with the Corona Virus stands at 3.73%

[

Here's a summery of some of the data

World Wide = 145,673 infected,Â  5,435 dead - Death Rate = 3.73%

USA =Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  2,329 infected, Â  Â  Â Â  50 dead -  Death Rate =    2.15%  


China's =Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  80,824 infected, Â  3,189 dead -  Death Rate =    3.95%

Italy =Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  17,660 infected,Â Â  1,266 dead -  Death Rate =    7.17%  


Iran =Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   11,364 infected, Â  Â    514 dead -  Death Rate =    4.52%  


UK = Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  798 infected,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  11 dead -  Death Rate =    1.38%

Philippine =Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  64 infected, Â  Â  Â  Â  6 dead -  Death Rate =    9.38%

New Cases reported today stands at 200, with 20 new deaths.

China -Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  11 new cases, 13 deaths

S. Korea -Â  107 new cases,Â  5 deaths

USA -Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  82 new cases,Â  1 death

Philippines-Â Â Â  0 new cases,Â  1 death

Assuming  an infection rate of 60%, and using our current rate of 2.15% as the  low, and 3.73% as the high, I expect these numbers:

USA = 350,000,000 citizens with 210,000,000 infected - 4,515,000 to  7,833,000 dead
