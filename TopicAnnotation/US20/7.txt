 I built a site, CrisisCommunity.com, to help compile resources for ways people can seek help (or provide help) in light of the Covid-19 epidemic. Is this kind of site helpful? Hi r/CoronavirusUS!

[CrisisCommunity.com]( is the result of various Coronavirus discussions where my colleagues and friends asked “I wonder how can I help?” and “How do I get help?”

People started researching and sending lists of various resources, and I realized that a central housing of that information might be helpful for a broader audience.

I built [CrisisCommunity.com]( with that in mind. It's designed to be a resource center that aggregates information. While not a complete replacement to one's own research, it’s a decent starting point. 

It is not a news source, nor is it a commercial website (no ads). Just ways to seek and provide help.

Currently, it has several sections:

* **I need help (for Individuals)**
   * 🍞 [Food Assistance](
   * 📄 [Filing for Unemployment](
   * 🧑‍💼 [Find A Job](
   * 🩺 [Healthcare]( 
   * 📚 [Education (Kids &amp; Young Adults)](
   * 😌 [Managing Stress](
   * 📺 [At-Home Entertainment](
* **I need help (for Organizations)**
   * 🚧 *Still under development*
* **I want to help**
   * 🚑 [Medical Supplies (PPE, Blood)](
   * 🧑‍💻 [Volunteer Digitally](
   * 💵 [Financial Support](

If you think this useful, I'd greatly appreciate it if you could help me by:

* **Sharing** this with friends
* **Providing feedback** here or via the feedback form at the bottom of each page
* **Contributing content** by nominating sources or volunteering as an editor or curator — just DM me or find my email on the website's homepage

Today, it’s mostly just a team of 1 (me) working nights and weekends, but I check the site daily and work fast to keep up to speed. 

I hope this helps some people, and wish everyone health and safety during this challenging time.
