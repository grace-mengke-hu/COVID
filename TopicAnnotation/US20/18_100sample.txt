 Warning from chinese for the 5 truth of coronavirus!!  

Warning !Warning ! Warning to all Americans, Japanese, and Europeans who dont know the truth about Coronavirus!

I come from a small city in southern China. Like hundreds of millions of Internet users in our country, I have witnessed everything happening in Wuhan in a few months. We know that the new virus is so terrible that the people and governments of our country need to spend a lot of effort and sacrifice to control it, but we find that most governments in the United States, Japan, and some European countries are trying to provide their people conceal the truth of this new virus. If these governments or peoples of these countries do not act to do something, one or two months later, if no vaccine and corresponding measures are developed, hell will come to earth.

Countries outside China rarely know that China has a history of 5,000 years, so for thousands of years , the Chinese people have a set of unofficial, secret emergency communications systems to ensure that no governor can do anything important concealed above. This communication system can be regarded as an unspoken，default contract between the people and the government. It has been used by rebels opposed to the government many times during the dynasty change, even today.

In this communication system, I collected the following facts of the new crown virus reflected by our people for reference

NO1. The coronavirus is highly infectious. Close contact with potential carriers for 15-30 seconds without protection will make you infected.

NO2. The coronavirus has a very high concealment, about 5-7% of the human body contains the virus but neither fever nor cough, looks like normal people.

NO3. The coronavirus has a very sudden death We have seen at least 20 similar messages through secret channels: the patient performed well a few hours ago, and then suddenly died within a hour or 2

NO4. The coronavirus is more lethal than expected. There is a premise for the lethality of 2-3% of WHO give us,which you have done all the medical care you can to protect the patient's life. And the medical means are insufficient or more extreme. Under certain circumstances (such as total indulgence), lethality may be as high as 5-9%

NO5. Most importantly, the new coronavirus will cause most people to die extremely painfully. In some example of the virus, the body accumulate a large amount of mucus in the lungs due to the "inflammatory storm" of the immune system, which makes every breath you breathe like drowning in the water.Think aboue it.....sticking your head into the water ,take a deep breath and take it out again .... The patients with the coronavirus will repeat this pain non-stop for dozens of hours-just to take a breath. As a result of dissecting the corpse, the originally soft lungs completely hardened and turned into a flat plate

Let me tell you exactly what happened in China: In the early days, stupid local officials in Wuhan tried to use administrative power to stop the spread of viral information, but some people passed them through and use secret communications and give the information directly to the CCP executives as a warning. Some smarter CCP executives in Beijing immediately understood that if the coronavirus is not stopped, the entire China will be destroyed.

So ccp immediately dismissed Wuhan officials and blocked all road in Wuhan and Hubei Province to ensure that no one can take the virus out of Hubei, and then China ’s national machine was running at very high speed and full power .For one and a half months. The ccp mobilized tens of thousands of medical personnel across the country, prepare hundreds of thousands of logistical reserves, and the strictest isolation like time stop of 1.4 billion people in 2 month .With these actions to support Wuhan, this is what you have see official detection rates and mortality now.

In your eyes,ccp may be dictatorial, but by no means it stupid. About coronavirus, both the CCP and the public realize that the virus does not care about politics, ideology,religion, morals, humanities, sexual orientation, etc. Seriously, you can survive if you treat it in a scientific way, otherwise it will be extinction waiting for you, so blocking the news is very stupid, the virus will not stop because of blocking the news, and our secret channel also guarantees In such an emergency, any concealment of the condition by the CCP is equivalent to its own political suicide.

Therefore, don't let our 1.4 billion people 2 mouth hard work in vain! In order to protect yourself, to protect your loved ones, and protect our human civilizationl, please do the following:

A, Wear a mask now! Immediately! Because you don't know if the people around you are asymptomatic! Very important! !!Some governments tell people not to wear masks, but small masks may save your life when you face a asymptomatic patient!

B, The government must do nucleic acid tests for all people to physically isolate infected people from normal people! As the Chinese and South Korean governments do. Otherwise, there will be more and more infected people!

C, The government must start to prepare supplies immediately, plan plans, and cope with the shortage of medical personnel and large-scale purchases of medical supplies and daily necessities. The state apparatus

must move speedly,now!Because tsunami will soon arrive in 2-3 weeks!Are you and your your government ready to build a breakwater?

We belong to different countries, but we are born on the same planet and belong to the same civilization. I sincerely hope you be better in this hard time.

May the god bless you, my friends across the ocean.

 What is your perspective of how citizens from other countries compare to US citizens in their response? As a Canadian citizen, I see what's happening in the US and I'm really scared for the citizens of our neighboring country. Part of my childhood was in the US. We should all be in this together.

Do you think people are acting in other countries like they are in the US - neglecting and shrugging off warnings?

I don't intend to cast a wide net. My time living in the states was only in Florida, and I still have family there, very close in ties to our family, who likely won't survive this. Do they think that people are being just as neglectful in other countries or other places - like it's the norm?

 Communist China owes us at least $8 trillion Back in December, instead of isolating and tracing potential infected people and sharing data with the world, the very first action the CCP took was to censor all information. They suppressed Dr. Li and his colleagues. Yes, they took draconian action later and quarantined cities, but none of that would be necessary if they tried to stop the virus in December in the first place. And even after the CCP took action, videos leaking out of Wuhan showed, and continue to show, people dying on the street, apartment buildings being welded off, and citizens yelling 'fake' at the authorities. Plenty of anecdotal accounts prove that plenty of people in Wuhan were refused testing and weren't counted as COVID cases even after they died.

Almost all projections and models from scientists show that it's unlikely the cases in China topped out at 90k, especially since the virus started spreading in mid December AT THE LATEST. Facts and evidence from Italy show that the CCP's stats are probably wrong. A few leaks from CCP officials show that the official case count could be understated by 10x, 20x or even 50x. 

Based on all the evidence I can gather, I'm putting all the blame on the Communist Party of China. They allowed their own people and the rest of the world to get infected just to 'save their own face' in the beginning. Tens of millions of people might die across the world in the coming months, including 100000's or even a few million in the U.S. They're about to lose their ENTIRE face from the world's perspective.

If there were a monetary amount that we could somehow bill to China, what would it be?

First of all, the cost to the U.S. economy will be at least $4 trillion. The federal government/Mnuchin are about to spend $2 trillion (10% of GDP for a year), on bailouts, helicopter cash and QE. I expect them to inject $2 trillion more of stimulus into the economy sometime on the future. Total: $4 trillion. This doesn't count economic losses that aren't bailed out or compensated.

Now let's count the number of American lives lost. It's really hard to estimate the cost of human lives, but let me try anyway. The average American's lifetime earnings are $2.7 million. Once you take into account future economic growth (2%/year for 20 years), that number becomes $4 million. It's impossible to predict how many deaths there will be, but let's say the death rate will be 1% (&lt;1% with proper medical care, which we won't have pretty soon). I think that's a conservative percentage.

If 30% of all Americans become infected (the lower end of estimates from scientists and politicians), you end up with 1 million deaths. **1 million * $4 million = $4 trillion.**

My personal worst case prediction, which is just speculation, is a 70% spread rate and a 3% death rate. That's 7 million dead Americans, for a cost of $28 trillion.

In my conservative scenario above, the total cost to the U.S. is $8 trillion. In my worst case scenario, it's $32 trillion. Of course, China will never pay up or even admit fault. The CCP is incapable of even apologizing to their own people.

What's the moral of the story? **COMMUNISM KILLS**. The CCP murdered tens of millions of people in the past, so we shouldn't be surprised if the same authoritarian regime murders tens of millions in 2020. We cannot depend on China anymore. Why were we so stupid to outsource 80-90% of our medical production to just one country?

Once again, the CCP didn't just 'have an outbreak'. They knowingly suppressed attempts to nip the outbreak in the bud. Also, even though China is very capitalist, I'm going to use the word 'communist' because that's what the CCP calls itself, and their communist policies during Mao's revolution is exactly what led to up to 60 million deaths.

The average Chinese person  in China is in no way at fault. It's the government who deliberately messed up. Also, let's try not to stigmatize people who immigrated from China and are now American citizens, since many of them will be the doctors and researchers saving American lives. That's why I think the term 'CCP virus' is better than 'Chinese virus'. It makes it easier for the world to lay the blame where it belongs.

It's not all doom and gloom, though. I'm hopeful and optimistic that the world and America can learn from this crisis. I'm seeing encouraging signs of private companies setting aside their profit for now to focus on the outbreak, government officials from different sides cooperating, and ordinary people contributing their time and resources. Let's hope that factories will come back to the U.S., or be moved to countries that we can trust, like South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, India and Mexico.

 Coronavirus Outbreak in relation to Bible Prophecy With the scare of the Coronavirus on the rise, there are a lot of questions; Where did the Coronavirus come from? Did God allow it? Why did God allow it? Should we be afraid? Is there any solution to stopping the Coronavirus? These are the questions that are going to be explored today! This has many people searching and asking is the world ending?

People are searching for answers to these questions and the Bible has those Answers. While it is only March, Bible Prophecy had been happening in 2020 that points to the return of Jesus Christ. Not only is the Coronavirus Outbreak one of those signs, but there are many other Bible Prophecy happening in 2020 that must be talked about,

 As a Chinese living in the US, I’m depressed by the status quo I have followed the entire Covid-19 situation in China and the other countries, and now am seeing US and some European countries make the same mistakes China had made at early stages all over again. Covid-19 IS airborne and wearing a mask DOES help. We paid our price to learn that. Yes I know you don’t trust the Chinese government, but what’s the point on lying about these studies?  I bet you see more Asians wear masks than other racial groups. Is it because they know Covid-19 better from their home countries or is it because they are stupid cowards?

I see there are healthcare workers complaining about protective equipment shortages, and people are questioning about its credibility. You better believe those are real and start to manufacture and/or donate essential protective equipment ASAP. The situation will only get worse. The healthcare system will be doomed if massive frontline doctors and workers get infected. That happened in Wuhan late January. I cried myself to sleep everyday seeing those doctors/nurses saving people’s lives barehanded and then struggling intimated. The situation only improved when tens of thousands of doctors/nurses from other provinces went to Wuhan for rescue with massive of supplies all across China. 

I know you probably think as a superpower, America can just manufacture whatever it needs or purchase from other countries at a snap. But the entire world is in shortage of these supplies, and manufacturing takes time. The manufactures need to set up production line, sort out raw materials which may or may not need to be imported... Well the point is people need to act now. 

I saw a lot of racism and prejudicial comments these days, and personally think the western world holds more misunderstandings and hostility towards China than it deserves. Whatever China is doing, it stands for totalitarianism, brainwashing, lack of human rights etc. That’s fine. But please take a look at some Asian countries like Japan and Korea which know China slightly better - they had confirmed cases earlier or roughly the same time with the US, but they learned their lessons from China.  See how they are doing now compared to the US.

I don’t give a dime about Trump or the US government. I don’t care how many US people hate China for its production capacity of these equipment (though they rarely consider the inhumanely low labor cost). But frontline doctors and laid-off workers are innocent. People may be racist, but virus is not. I hate to see more people, western or Asian, get hurt by ignorance or politicians’ prejudice. 

Do these make sense?

 Leads of Possible Man-Made Corona Virus pointing to Depopulation Efforts? Although this could just be speculation, but many people are currently suggesting that Bill Gates funded this new corona virus for depopulation efforts and there is proof going back to Event 201, which did a "simulation" of a pandemic that just happened to be called a corona virus and just happened to be months before corona virus started happening, that was funded by his own foundation, his Ted Talks signaling "Innovating to 0", the Rockefeller Foundation plan which calls for "Lock Step" and other wealthy individuals involved with an effort to depopulate the world in order to reduce oxygen consumption. How "coincidental" also that Bill Gates owns a patent for corona virus and the vaccine and is now pushing ID2020 agenda where everyone would have to be traced when given the vaccine. He would never give this away or talk about it though, in fact, even more devious he pretended recently to be helpful by donating 100 million to the cause. Even more suspicious considering the most devious people are the first to show up to the crime scene to be helpful so that they seem less suspicious.  


Don’t be surprised if there are forced vaccines created by Gates himself to enact volunteered silent mass genocide. I’m not an anti-vaxxer either, I got every vaccine there is, but when you look at Bill Gates’ past with massive push for Eugenics and depopulation to reduce oxygen consumption and earth sustainability, it becomes more clear that there is more behind this man than people are willing to believe. Look up Bill Gates and his association with Jeffrey Epstein also, they were friends and in pictures together AFTER Epstein was convicted for sex crimes and Bill was trying to deny even just association after it was documented, this alone should make you suspicious.  


On top of this, there are several leads thus far pointing out that this corona virus being man-made in collaboration of several biochemical scientists of UNC-Chapel Hill, Australia and other areas, which uses gain-of-function biological warfare science to produce a virus of this capacity that was then sold and given to China, which tried making it a weapon at first but it supposedly backfired and unleashed onto their own society. It makes sense then why the Chinese government tried covering it up for so long. This was traced from scientific papers that did analysis on corona virus claiming that it has gain-of-function properties, which makes it extremely easy to spread AND even has traces of DNA that is unique to HIV. All of this very scary to be honest, and I wouldn't be surprised honestly if it is the truth. All of this being not covered in the media as well as all these extremely wealthy individuals all being tied together like Bill Gates, Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, and even Trump all in ties with Jeffrey Epstein all people with extreme wealth and power giving fake shows of "philanthropy" to fool the common person while they are just funneling taxes or using "philanthropy" for some other hidden agenda. Stuff like this doesn't seem so far fetched anymore.

 This is an interesting read. 
Please take time to read this 

How to dominate the world quickly?

THE GREAT CHINESE STAGE

1. Create a virus and the antidote.

2. Spread the virus.

3. A demonstration of efficiency, building hospitals in a few days. After all, you were already prepared, with the projects, ordering the equipment, hiring the labor, the water and sewage network, the prefabricated building materials and stocked in an impressive volume.

4. Cause chaos in the world, starting with Europe.

5. Quickly plaster the economy of dozens of countries.

6. Stop production lines in factories in other countries.

7. Cause stock markets to fall and buy companies at a bargain price.

8. Quickly control the epidemic in your country. After all, you were already prepared.

9. Lower the price of commodities, including the price of oil you buy on a large scale.

10. Get back to producing quickly while the world is at a standstill. Buy what you negotiated cheaply in the crisis and sell more expensive what is lacking in countries that have paralyzed their industries.

After all, you read more Confucius than Karl Marx.

PS: Before laughing, read the book by Chinese colonels Qiao Liang and Wang Xiangsui, from 1999, “Unrestricted Warfare: China’s master plan to destroy America”, on Amazon, then we talk. It's all there.

Worth pondering.. 
Just Think about  this... 

How come Russia &amp; North Korea are totally free of Covid- 19? Because they are staunch ally of China. Not a single case reported from this 2 countries. On the other hand South Korea / United Kingdom / Italy / Spain and Asia are severely hit. How come Wuhan is suddenly free from the deadly virus?

 China will say that their drastic  initial  measures they took was very stern and Wuhan was locked down to contain the spread to other areas. I am sure they are using the Anti dode of the virus. 

Why Beijing was not hit?  Why only Wuhan? Kind of interesting to ponder upon.. right? Well ..Wuhan is open for business now. America and all the above mentioned countries are devastated financially. Soon American economy will collapse as planned by China.  China knows it CANNOT defeat America militarily as USA is at present 

THE MOST POWERFUL  country in the world. So use the virus...to cripple the economy and paralyse the nation and its Defense capabilities. I'm sure Nancy Pelosi got a part in this. . to topple Trump. Lately President Trump was always telling of how GREAT American economy was  improving in all fronts. The only way to destroy his vision of making AMERICA GREAT AGAIN is to create an economic havoc. Nancy Pelosi was unable to bring down Trump thru impeachment. ....so work along with China to destroy Trump by releasing a virus. Wuhan,s epidemic was  a showcase. At the peak of  the virus epidemic. ..

China's President Xi Jinping...just wore a simple RM1 facemask to visit those effected areas.  As President he should be covered from head to toe.....but it was not the case.  He was already injected to resist any harm from the virus....that means a cure was  already in place before the virus was released. 

Some may ask....Bill Gates already predicted the outbreak in 2015...so the chinese agenda cannot be true. The answer is. ..YES...Bill Gates did predict. .but that prediction is based on a genuine virus outbreak.  Now China is also telling that the virus was predicted well in advance. ....so that its agenda would play along well to match that  prediction. China,s vision is to control the World economy by buying up stocks now from countries facing the brink of severe  ECONOMIC COLLAPSE.  Later China will announce that  their Medical Researchers  have found a cure to destroy the virus.  Now China have other countries stocks in their arsenal and these countries will soon be slave to their master...CHINA.

Just Think about  it ... 
The Doctor Who declared  this virus was also Silenced by the Chinese  Authorities...

 Nurse Shift Swapping across the country? Hear me out on my idea

We have a really big country. Unlike Italy or something, we have so much resources that are widely dispersed across completely different regions.

Instead of nurses being exhausted working 15-hour shifts 15 days in a row, we need our govt to map/predict where cities will be hard-hit and when. The places that won't have hospital shortages for 2-3 weeks can send nurses to the cities hit hardest now. Then when the cities hit hardest how are in slightly better shape, they return the favor and send some of their nurses back to where nurses were sent to them from. Everyone will get better medical care, because obviously people can't do their best when they are barely getting any sleep.

What do you think? How could this be implemented? 

P.S. - Anyone in the medical field can provide some insight?

The spread drops significantly.

Then the initial panic goes away and we continue our normal lives and.... The virus spreads to hundreds of thousands of people, but in a month instead of now? 

Are we expecting the virus to get to zero before we resume life as normal? 

Can someone smarter than me explain how this mass social distancing helps in the long run?

 Italy asking the world to listen and react before it's too late 

*A letter from Italy:*
 
 We live in Italy - Milan,
 I'm going to share with you and explain to you, "How is life here in Milan" during these difficult days and how do I think you should learn from the mistakes and their consequences that we live here.
 We are currently in quarantine.  We don't take to the streets, the police are in constant motion and arrest anyone outside his home.

 Everything is closed!  ... business, malls, stores, all streets without movement. Feeling of the end of the world !!

 It is a fact that I never thought I would ever live!
 People are confused, sad, anxious and helpless, and often do not understand how this reality was imposed on them and when this whole nightmare will end.

 *The big mistake was that at the start of the first hit people continued to lead their lives as usual and took to the streets for work, entertainment and feeling like a vacation period, so gatherings with friends and banquets abound.*
 *Everyone was wrong and so were you!*

 *I beg you, be careful, this is neither a laugh nor a joke!!!!!*

 Protect your loved ones, your parents, and your grandparents!  The disease is dangerous for them.
 About 200 people die here every day, *not because medicine in Milan is not good (it's one of the best in the world), but rather because there are no places for everyone!*

 *Doctors choose who will die!*  

*This is only because of the silliness of the citizens at the beginning, who decided to continue their lives as usual, regardless of the new situation!*

 Please, learn from the mistakes, we are a small country that could end up with a great tragedy.

*Listen well now 🙏*

 *Don't go out into crowded places.*
 *Try not to eat in public places.*
  *Stay longer at home during this time!*
 *Listen to the Ministry of Health guidelines (don't play it!).*
  *Talk about a meter away from each person, do not come close, do not cuddle or accept.*

 Get a complementary and preventive treatment and learn from others' mistakes.
 *We recommend that you take vitamin C to boost your immune system*

 Helping professionals prevent the spread of the epidemic ...

In Italy, the entire country is isolated, meaning 60 million people in quarantine !!

*This would have been prevented if people had heard the instructions from the beginning.*

 I feel like 90% of the government around the world really dropped the ball Don't get me wrong, it is easy to criticize other countries. Back in January, people were mad at how poorly China handled things. Fast forward to today, most people from the rest of world seem to be in disbelief with their own government. It is almost seems like China did much better than their own country. Granted, there are things that can only be done China.

It feels like the amount of time China bought the world did nothing. Most of the government from the rest of the world are still running around like headless chickens. Now what China did does not seem so bad anymore.

The list goes on from the lack of airport closures, lack of airport security health check, faulty kits, cover ups, don’t test don’t tell, patients turned away from testing, doctors and hospitals were not allowed to do testing, mask propaganda.

I can’t believe the shit show we are in right now.

 Could the U.S. even quarantine communities like China has, if they tried? With our government and culture, do you think it would even be possible to quarantine communities to the scale shown in China and SK? 

How do you contain a virus in a city the scale of NYC with no martial law, a loose government relative to China, less enforcement, etc. How do you stop people from leaving their homes when they don't live in gated communities like some cities in China? 

I see people point out U.S. incompetence, which is definitely true to an extent, but I feel as if the U.S. (at least at this point) has no shot at containment. For example, Why block travelers from Italy or SK when they're just one new vector among hundreds of thousands?

 Why are nations and governments suppressing NVOC19 info? The Asteroid conundrum If you knew in advance (months) an Asteroid was going to impact the planet and end “life as we know it” the world is forever changed. Do you tell everyone, knowing that people will panic, stop going to work, police, firefighters, caregivers all go fuck it and spend their last few weeks/months with family and doing what they want… Or do you tell everyone that everything is OK and not only get a chance to get your household in order, but also give the world a few extra months of normal. People going to dinner, celebrating birthdays, talking about sports etc.   

Which is worse, knowing the world is changing, people will die and you can’t stop it but saying nothing which may/will cause more to die. Knowing the world is changing, people will die you can’t stop it and warning everyone only for your life to get much harder, and you may save lives or you may accidently cause more death from panic and people leaving their work / going hard and causing chaos in the last bit of normal we have? 

Over and over we see NATIONS saying nothing to see here it's all good, while doing insane shit, then asking MILLIONS of people to stay inside, not go out and hope for the best. This is the time to prepare and make your life and those of your town/city better. Help yourself to help others later. Don't wait until you are being asked to stay home without pay for weeks, months. Get yourself setup now. What is the down side? You are well prepared for no reason and can not by food and cleaning supplies a while?

 This isn’t bragging, just to remind people that it only takes a little to make a difference. I wanted to spend the day at the mall, get my favorite meal, and enjoy myself and read my new book. I have spent $60 tipping 3 different local businesses to go on top of my $15 lunch. I slipped it in and I don’t think anyone noticed when I did. I live in Florida, we rely on tourists as an economic structure, and with the situation causing businesses to close down for a time, those that stay open have an even bigger risk as they are barley making money. I live with my parents, I have an easy enough job, and I have more money than I need. I am more than proud to support these people trying to feed themselves and their families, trying to hold onto their businesses, and their success. It’s not much, but I hope that others are giving tips as much as they can spare. Even a dollar makes a difference, when you can only have 50 people in your place of business. Good luck to anyone who’s struggling. I believe in you and I hope you make it through.

 We thought the Iran conflict could result in WW3, but the coronavirus could be the real cause of a possible WW3 Everyone is starting to get mad at China for the wet markets. People have been mad at China for silencing those who spoke of the coronavirus before it became a big problem, and for failing to prevent the spread of the virus to other countries. The anger towards China we are seeing now is only a mild beginning, and as the global pandemic begins to be resolved, people will start looking for how to blame the coronavirus on someone. It is naturally what humans do. At the end of the pandemic, everyone will be pointing fingers at China. Tensions will rise between China and the world. Should some countries happen to defend China, then this could be a division that leads to the two rival powers in a new world war. 

This is just my opinion of what I think could easily and possibly happen.

 Be smart with the stimulus check!!!!! GOVERNMENT STIMULUS CHECK
PAY ATTENTION, PEOPLE!!!!
So here’s what’s up:
1. To Tenants: If the government says you don’t have to pay your rent and there’s a ban on evictions, you better do whatever you can to pay your rent. There will be major repercussions when evictions bans are lifted. Don’t think you’ll get a free ride out of this. PAY YOUR RENT! Your landlord has bills to pay too.
2. To Homeowners: If the government tells banks to stop mortgage payments, DO WHATEVER YOU CAN TO PAY YOUR MORTGAGE!. Some lenders are saying you don’t have to pay for 3 months but on the 4th month, all four payments are due in full. Do not take a chance and not pay. Major foreclosures will come from all this. The banks didn’t help homeowners in 2008-09 and in 2020, it’s still the same. Pay your mortgage.
3. If the utility company suspends payments, you.better. PAY. ANY. AMOUNT. YOU . CAN! They are like banks, they will want their money eventually and when all this clears up, you’ll owe an exuberant bill and still won’t have any utilities. Pay whatever you can. This includes phone bills. 
4. If you get a government stimulus check, this check is to help pay your bills. That means you pay your rent, your mortgage, your utilities, your insurance, your car payment, y.o.u.r. b.i.l.l.s. This is not for frivolous spending. 
5. The real problem is, many who will get the stimulus check....you won’t pay your bills then be crying and wailing saying
“They evicted me. They cut off my power, they repossessed my car...”
All while you’re broke and carrying that empty purse you bought with your stimulus check.
Think and spend wisely! 
PAY YOUR BILLS!!!!

 I am sick of this misinformation by the USA government, to me this is a crime. I am sick of this misinformation by the USA government, to me this is a crime.


If “normal people” are likely to wear the mask wrong, then teach them mask etiquette and how to properly use it, don’t lie. Don’t blame us for the lack of preparation and incompetence. They literally had almost 2 months to prepare, stock up and yet all they care is their stock. For a good whole month, they did 400 tests... 400 tests in a country with a population of 350million with many international airports. If healthy people are not required to wear masks, then how would they know if they are not asymptomatic carriers? Great logic there by the USA government.

In a crisis, people can be gullible and choose only what they want to hear/read out of fear. Some people don’t have access to many sources for news and they rely on official news from the government. It’s a very dangerous tread the government is walking on.I have my parents and co-workers now believe this crap because it is what the government and doctors said..

Literally the only country to tell its people mask are not needed. Other countries like France ramps up their mask production factories. In China, they arrest people without mask, they build factories to produce more mask. 

Mask does help, but please educate yourself on how to store, put on, put off, dispose properly. There are lots of videos on youtube.

1. *Blame China.* This is the easiest one. Shifting blame is an obvious choice since they have mishandled it from the beginning, but that leads to the second point.

2. *Deny at every level*. Deny Covid-19 will come to the US, deny that it will have a significant effect, deny that it will last until April, the end of summer, past next year, etc. Why deny? If they would have handled it well, they would win the election by a landslide. If so many I individual redditors could see this coming, then the Republicans could too. So that begs the question: why deny from the beginning?

3. *Take as few actions as possible.* They avoid masks, open as many businesses as possible, open schools, promote gatherings and travel, etc. So, assuming they know the truth about how covid-19 spreads, why push for as many infections as possible?

4. *Claim success in the face of failure*. This is obvious for the same reasons that blame shifting is.

5. *Ignore and discredit experts*. This general Republican approach is to generate a lack of faith in science. This has been long term and arose out of the need to garner evangelical votes and to keep the support of the carbon industries. 

So, why? Are they hoping to blame Democrats as the elections arrive? Do they want to crash the economy as hard as possible in the long run in order to buy cheap stocks and properties? Is there a deeper and more insidious connection to Russia and/or China?

 Strategic National Stockpile website changed after Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner's controversial statement on national TV ~~Nepotism is usually discouraged within large private organizations for good reason. Our current president has placed a very questionably qualified daughter husband team within his administration.~~

~~Unfortunately, this is a perfect example of why nepotism should be illegal at this level within our federal government. Dare I say, Trumps daughter Ivanka and Jared Kushner are next to useless other than possible moral support for "Dad. Would this role be more appropriate outside the administration, rather than wasting two taxpayer paid positions?~~

~~Trump reportedly does not take a salary for his position. What about team Kushner? How much do we pay them?~~

.


**Crossed out above because I didn't initially intend to get political, and  potentially get shutdown for comments or deleted.**

.

Getting back on track, this is specifically about what Jared Kushner said in a TV appearence during one of Trumps
~~campaign events~~ **Correction:** coronavirus briefings. : 

And the aftermath that included changing the US federal governments Strategic National Stockpile website.

.

**Has the function and scope of US federal governments Strategic National Stockpile actually changed?**
**I ask because of the urgency of the coronavirus pandemic and the possible implications of this change for us as citizens of the US.**

.

**BEFORE:**

&gt; Strategic National Stockpile is the nation’s largest supply of life-saving pharmaceuticals and medical supplies 
&gt; for use in a public health emergency severe enough to cause local supplies to run out. 
&gt;
&gt; When state, local, tribal, and territorial responders request federal assistance to support their response efforts, 
&gt; the stockpile ensures that the right medicines and supplies get to those who need them most during an emergency.
&gt;
&gt; Organized for scalable response to a variety of public health threats, 
&gt; this repository contains enough supplies to respond to multiple large-scale emergencies simultaneously.
    

**AFTER:**

&gt; The Strategic National Stockpile's role is to supplement state and local supplies during public health emergencies.
&gt;
&gt; Many states have products stockpiled, as well.
&gt; 
&gt; The supplies, medicines, and devices for life-saving care contained in the stockpile can be used as a short-term stopgap buffer 
&gt; when the immediate supply of adequate amounts of these materials may not be immediately available.

 Perplexed that the governments are doing a 180 degree turns. Though the cases are increasing/constant, they are opening everything up. Help me understand this, because I am at a loss. **I am really scared of what is going on right now and I am very confused. I would appreciate your help in understanding this.**

I feel like we know what's going on in the US. People gathering in Ozarks, going to beaches in Florida, Disney parks opening, people getting back on the planes over the Memorial Day Weekend, to name just a few.

I also want to pinpoint a couple of other concerning examples from abroad.

**Poland** experiences fairly constant/increasing number of cases each day. Yet, despite this, the country went from a complete lock down (when there were fewer daily cases) to a complete relaxed country:

* churches can now have as many people as desired
* facemasks no longer required
* weddings of 150 allowed
* stadiums for soccer games are now open for public
* restaurants are back to open

**Spain** is opening up its borders to ANY and ALL travelers starting in July.

**WHAT AM I MISSING HERE?!**

It appears that people are abandoning social distancing measures, theme parks are opening up, people are getting back on the planes, and the governments are actively supporting thoughtless re-openings.

I understand that the governments have made the math, and calculated that economies are no longer able to support the lockdowns. 

However, **they are doing this in an uncoordinated manner.** In my opinion, **now is the most dangerous time to be out.** We will have many irresponsible people who will be traveling, going to large events, and then interacting with people who still take things seriously. 

At the same time, we, people who take things seriously, will be forced to go back to the offices because everyone acts like nothing happened.

**The real numbers of new infections and deaths will increase dramatically (even if they are not reported by the government).**

At the same time, I have a hunch that the Governments have a vested interest in deflating the actual numbers of infections and deaths. They want people to have an unfounded feeling of security and safety.  
**PLEASE HELP ME UNDERSTAND!**

 China wants US to apologize for China coronavirus! China has launched massive campaign to change the narrative of its own crime against humanity. The Chinese government has spent tremendous propaganda resources including buying politicians to side with China on its false narrative about the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak. China has also unleashed a massive cyber army on social media outlets like Twitter, Facebook, and even Reddit to intimidate, attack, block, or otherwise suppress any posts that link China to the Wuhan coronavirus.  There seems to be many so-called "moderators" who get dirty money from the Chinese government to ban people from posting negative views about China in the midst of the Chinese virus outbreak. 

The damage China has inflicted upon the entire world is to vast to even be assessed at this point. Meanwhile, China is committing cover-ups and changing public opinions about China's own crimes against humanity. It's time the world see the real ugly face of China.

 Wasteful spending. Is it just me or is this just wasteful?  Most people have internet or some form of communication where we can receive this “letter.”  Was it necessary to pay for postage and other fees to send one personally out to everyone other than to get political gain?  

At .57 and 300,000,000 million people assuming it didn’t go to everyone. That’s 171,000,000 million dollars in just postage that was unnecessary spending.

 Large gatherings... At what point do we stop getting mad at these covid idiots for going out to bars, parties, large gatherings, ect. and start blaming the governor’s for opening too soon/not shutting down when covid cases spike? I keep seeing the news report on these large parties people are having like the Sturgis rally and holiday parties but literally nothing is getting done to punish people?? Basically as long as things are open, people are going out and living life like normal and most don’t follow guild lines. I just wish the government would step up and try to help cases from getting out of control. 

I watched a youtube video of a girl from Florida who got covid from going to a bar and she explained how she didn’t even do anything wrong, she went out to a place that was legally open and she and 30 other people contracted the virus. BUT FLORIDA IS STILL OPEN?!?! Yes she should have been smarter but honestly, most people are dumb and think that because things are open, covid is gone. Are you kidding me.

 (WA)Tri-cities grocery stores sell out of meat, produce, canned food, water, toilet paper as panic buying spreads. Surprised this wasn't in the news. I was just at winco and walmart and it's getting really hard to find food. People are showing up as soon as shipments arrive and clearing the shelves. Medicine is even hard to find anymore. Well, the good news is they still have plenty of stuff the mainstream people don't eat like bacon-wrapped tenderloin, shrimp, olives, wine, beer. I really feel bad for people who can't buy baby food for their babies. I wish these stores would limit how much people can buy.

 Why is it so hard for some people to believe Coronavirus is real? There’s a group of people around me - mostly men, in disbelief Coronavirus is as dangerous as we hear.   And I say ‘hear” because we don’t know of anyone around us that can prove them wrong.  They actually believe the videos going around of hospitals full of sick people are fake.  They rather believe people in the internet saying they’ve visited hospitals and it’s business as “usual”.  With front desk employees saying “we were told to get ready because sick people are coming but there’s nothing”.

What they do believe is that this coronavirus is just like the flu but the media is exaggerating it.

 Be Careful of Coronavirus Mutual Aid Groups. My rich friend just scammed $80k out of them I don't want to discourage people from being charitable, but I'm sharing this because maybe you want to 1) avoid donating to this particular type of person or 2) protect your group from scammers. 

Basically, my friend has been a scammer of sorts for years but she usually does not succeed. She pretended to be Jewish to get a free trip to Israel, but Birthrite asked for a reference from a rabbi. She tried to sue people without any evidence in the hopes they would just give her money in a settlement, but they called her bluff.  

Then she found mutual aid groups and discovered that no one really checks who they're giving money to. She easily raised 80k in a month and will use it to not work, to vacation when it becomes possible, and a boob job. 

I certainly believe that these groups are overall good, and I know vetting each applicant isn't always easy and maybe it's not worth the hassle. But here are some things maybe to look out for. 

1) **Not having a public campaign.** My friend only asked for direct donations and did not have a GoFundMe or anything, because if she did, people would know how much more she raised over legitimate causes. 

2) **Not asking people they know to contribute or posting on their own social media pages.** My friend strictly asked strangers, not people she knew. If people who actually knew her saw her asking, they would certainly ask why someone who vacationed 8 weeks last year, has deep savings, and has no debt would need to fundraise. 

And before you say "report her:" To whom? The mayor of Google spreadsheets? 

Anyway, I hope this is useful for you considering charity. You know GoFundMe has a problem with people raising money by impersonating more deserving people. Personally I would just go straight through vetted charities.

 PSA: Please don't handle money I just witnessed a great example of mass public ignorance.

At a store, people (customers and employee are using all sorts of protection. Gloves, hand sanitizer, sticks to press buttons. Everything is somewhat isolated. Until you reach checkout. All the same people who are trying not to get infected hand money from their own wallet to the clerk. Clerk gives change they put in their own wallet. When handling money they are doing nothing to protect.... Money is gross on a normal day.... It carries mass amounts of germs. 

When you put it back into your wallet, you take everything it has with you, spreading it to your other bills. Then you give it to a cashier, they get it on their hands, put it in the drawer, it spreads stuff to other money. Now that cashier is handing out all sorts of infection causing germs to future customers.

Use contactless pay as much as possible please everyone. 

Here is the supporting research from a few years ago.

 Pentagon UFO footage is not real Lets get this straight. When the pentagon released footage of UFOs, it was fake. Why? Well, any government would never think to uncover the mystery of them. They remain ignorant to the existance of aliens for our own safety, and for the fear of not understanding them. They defy physics, and if extra terrestrial life was to arrive, it would be the biggest histort event and would require the cooperation of world leaders to deal with it. I think most people said they only released this footage was for like the rest of the things going on this year that was to distract us from the virus. But how does it? We will look at it and think "oh cool, but how about all these deathes from the virus?". I think they're kinda stupid.

 Why hasn’t my corporation not mentioned ANYTHING to us about our safety? How many non-essential jobs are not being shut down?

Schools: shut down. Big gatherings: shut down. Most jobs: shut down / remote working.

I work at a grocery store, I get it. Why can’t I do overnight stocking? Why can’t they have one person in each department during open hours (why not even limited operating hours?) with masks and gloves?

You know how many people I see not coughing or washing their hands properly?

If the government is going to freak out, they need to freak out the entire way. Why is shit like Starbucks open? I slightly understand grocery stores, but is your Vegan Keto GF ice cream a priority?

Stores have been out of sanitizer, masks, etc. for months now. You know how many people asks yesterday? I just started saying “NOPE” and turned around to keep working.

 China's Chilling Reaction for the Speard of Covid-19 in the World I got a lot of family and friends in China and I can read Chinese so I have a good sense on what the mainstream attitude in both media &amp; ordinary Chinese people. You would not believe how many people are overtly cheering for the confirmed numbers to go up in the US, Europe &amp; the rest of the world. I just cant believe people can be this evil. I mean being selfish is one thing, taking pleasure in others suffering is just messed up. When US hit 100,000 cases, I saw posts titled "Great News". I saw people in group chat saying" I wish England will hit that number soon." 

I am sure there are people who are good and feel for the world, but the majority of people/media are just like that, cheering for the spread of the virus &amp; the fall economy. 

Plus, many people in China is heavily attacking international who study aboard and want to go home. They said if you made the choice to study aboard then you don't deserve to go home. 

I just couldn't hold it in anymore and needed to rant. I am so MAD to see these horrible stuff said by real people and some media outlet in China. 

We need to stay kind to each other guys,regardless of nationality! We can beat this. Let's not let the bad guys find pleasure in our pain.

 International Organization Governments Are Using Wrong Strategy &amp; Handling The Corona Virus Outbreak Poorl **International Organization Governments Are Using Wrong Strategy &amp; Handling The Corona Virus Outbreak Poorly**  
 **Source &amp; Other Interesting Uncensored News: theworld.data.blog**

Many if big international organization and national governments either in secret or in public are using wrong strategy for public affair, they are committing suicide.

Here are the strategy they are using from the beginning:  
 – Lying, cover up &amp; expect the “legendary corona virus NCOV 666” go away miracle.  
 – First they are saying it not dangerous, second it will gone away in summer, etc.  
 – Rely on stupid science instead of using common sense.

Now they are completely out of hand, out of control already in Europe and North America.

**They are accident create much more fear, why?**  
 Because the citizens was told they are not dangerous from the beginning, but the truth they face in real life is the absolutely opposite. And to the point where many top government officials pass away because of this NCOV, that when the maximum fear was created.  
 Citizens will ask and wonder even top government officials with top notch medical team &amp; devices cannot save themselves, how can us normal casual people can stay alive ?!

If I was in charged, I would rather tell the truth like this: “**this is a new type of virus, look very dangerous, some of us may be die because of that NCOV. But the good news is that, we just need fully know their features strength and weakness, so we can easily overcome it just like many history new virus appearance. Do not worry, just treat it as a new dangerous animal or a novel virus.**”

So it that was spoke to the public at first, all the number death rate or any casualty are meaningless. But now instead people not just fear because of death/infected number, but also a lot of other subjects like “how the hell we can survive, what is the way while even top government officials have gone because of this NCOV?”

As a savior I can still tell you that: only me can handle this situation and this catastrophe, but I am not going to give it freely so any entities/beings can steal it.

You know what website to contact and have a direct communication with me online.

Best Regard,

 Life of a Millennial parent during covid Ex wife drops daughter off at 7:50 M-F and stays until 5 PM.

Daycare is still not open, nor do I want my daughter going to school with other kids until a vaccine is provided (I don’t see how they can cut class size by 50%). I want to respect our governor’s decisions that are based on science and not the almighty economy that we revere so much in the US, I hope one day I can invest and build an adequate life for my family, it seems like a pipe dream at this point for most of us. Hell, I’d even take a round of golf, but the guilt of spending any money on myself anymore will prevent me from doing so.

Haven’t received unemployment in 8 weeks, still waiting on a “open monetary issue” and haven’t been able to get a single response or phone call through to the unemployment office.

I did bite the bullet and got a part time job at a local sandwich shop and I am very thankful for the opportunity to go work and make money, even though it’s going to put myself and my family at risk, and not to mention it’s going to be a 3rd of the amount of money that I will need to pay for bills. A cell phone is starting to seem like a luxury I can’t afford either.

My Congressman, Bill Huizenga is a complete egocentric, money hungry Republican that could care less about any of these issues. 20 emails and I still haven’t received a genuine, non automated response. I get Republicans want less government control but this is absolute ridiculous at this point.

I take solace with the fact that the people with little money are doing more for each other than they should have too, and it really inspires me to try to create a better life for my daughter and I so we can use our good fortune to make the lives of people who really, really need it.

At this point, I do have shelter, food, water, and fire. The basic elements of survival, I am very thankful for that.

Our founding fathers would be shaking their heads in shame at what we’ve become as a country.

I pray that the people at the top on the red side of the aisle and the people that support them start looking around at what the actual problems in the country are. This isn’t the fucking Apprentice! This is real fucking life! Start acting like it!

Millennials aren’t lazy, the generations before us have “drained the swamp” alright, to the point that most of us don’t have any chance of catching a fish for ourselves anymore.

Back to normal is the last thing this country needs. Capitalism has failed us all!

 Fuck people who don’t take this pandemic seriously! Public health experts are still recommending citizens to abide by proper social distancing since we still don’t have a vaccine. I see too many people not wearing masks and not practicing social distancing when they go outside. I have a friend who is ignorant, he invited his friends to go hiking this afternoon (mind you that these people are not the ones within his household). For me, it’s just dense and selfish to go out just because you feel bored at home. We can’t really get over this pandemic if some people won’t do their part. What irritates me more is that my friend doesn’t know where these people have been and he doesn’t know if they have been infected or not because some people are not showing any signs and symptoms (they’re asymptomatic). 

Please just go out if you absolutely need to (job/food/medicine). The fight is still not over!

 The issue specifically in the USA, is that we obviously have a huge problem, but half the country, no matter what, will pretend it doesn't exist or if they do acknowledge it, that it was inevitable Half the country have convinced themselves that any deaths were inevitable anyway and that their family members and friends aren't really dying of coronavirus and they'll resist more isolation no matter what. The media will always give them disproportionate screen time, because that creates a more interesting story, skewing the narrative against taking reasonable precautions.

A lot of people understand that the pandemic never ended but millions more are being misinformed by either the media or Trump. We could literally hit 1M deaths in the US this year and half of the country will either pretend it didn't happen or act like it was unavoidable anyway.

 The skittles analogy thing is Wack I see a lot of comparison's to coronavirus 97% survival rate to the "100 skittles with 3 skittles that will kill you" thing but i really think that analogy is kinda ass. I think a better way to think of it is like Rainbow Six Siege's chance to open an alpha pack in how the bigger the %, the better chance you get to open it. Think about it, if i had an alpha pack with a 3% chance to open, I know for a damn fact that it probably wont open. Im not trying down play Covid-19 since its supposed to be more contagious than the flu or whatever but my god wack ass analogies that makes no sense are my bane. In my opinion.

 Just a small rant Honestly, I fully believe that lockdown is going to last for 12-18 months until a vaccine comes out. London Imperial College insists on it (the whole idea of lifting restrictions intermittently is fake, they didn’t say that, or was at least believed to he misinterpreted...) So people, all I’m trying to say is... get used to it. Get used to this normal of not seeing anyone, going anywhere, and being jobless and broke. You can thank the incompetence of POTUS and the evil of the CCP (both of whom are at major fault for this spread of the pandemic) for this new life we have to life. Sorry, not being a troll, but I’m just being honest. May God have mercy on us all.

Long story short thousands of people aren’t taking this seriously. Large unnecessary gatherings are still taking place. Many people think this is a vacation. People are hopeless. 

Every other country has stricter rules than us. In NYC people are still not being fined for not wearing masks or covering themselves somehow.

 ELI5: If China is starting to return to normal, why do so many people on here think we will not return to normal until January? I'm genuinely wondering. I try to avoid reading much on the virus because it makes me too freaked out so I skim headlines here for the most part. Yes, I'm still doing social distancing and everything I need to do, I just don't like to read up on it much.

I'm asking because I've seen plenty of people say they think kids won't be back in school by September, that things won't be normal by January etc. But I have family who live in China who have said that life is actually slowly going back to normal there. So if that's happening why do people say here it's going to take so much longer?

 I absolutely despise women. Furthermore I don't care about anyine else but myself- that includes whatever course this disaster takes. 
society over values holes. Women shouldn't be allowed to vote or have as many rights as men ( until they enlist in the draft) you are whores, not queens and should be treated as such. Let's be real here. Women don't actually take the time to research the issues ( they are not smart enough and I'd honestly be surprised if the majority can even read). They vote for presedential candidates based on who's " the most hot" and only run for office for the attention.

Society over values women. The majority of women are stupid and uneducated ( look at how few women are successful compared to men, and piggy backing on your boyfriend's/ husband's success doesn't count-sluts. I will personally value women the moment society as a whole acknowledges incels as being just as deserving of special rights as women. ( I'm not an incel but I am their champion).

 (question) approx how long might it take for everything to be back to semi-normal or even remotely back to normal.. i mean when will businesses open, libraries open, schools/ colleges re-start.. how long does social distancing have to last to be affective.. when is the estimated peak date for us? is it optimistic to think that everything will open in may and be back to normal?

 Visiting Trumper family. They wear the masks, they know it's real. But they won't stop making the "we need to get back to normal" argument.. I'm visiting some family in Long Island, NY. They are not nutso deniers, but they are definitely on the selfish end of conservative and CONSTANTLY talk about just needing to get back to normal. MIL is a school administrator who wears her mask and does the proper cleaning, yet she brushes off the virus saying kids don't really get it and if we get a break out the school is 100% ready to go remote, no problemo (they definitely aren't, this is directly from the mouths of the many other teachers I know there). SIL is a nurse who complains that the protesters are out not wearing masks and damaging business so we have to get back to normal so that they have to work and stop damaging the city (they're not and she doesn't even live in the city, where I am actually from). 

Question is: how in the freaking world do you talk to people like this? They're smart, well meaning people, but the minute you bring up anything that counters the plan to "get back to normal", IN THE MIDDLE OF A SPIKE IN CASES (so normal is literally not possible) they dig in their heels about needing to reopen. And I'm the idiot because I don't work at a school or hospital (I actually have worked in many capacities in both environments and have an MPH but my liberal self ~doesn't get it~). God forbid I should compare the US to any other countries. I know their opinions are politically tied. Any tips on how to interact with this?? Good arguments?? Insight into their thinking?? A good joke?? I'm just at a loss. 

Thank you for enduring my rant.

TL;DR family in NY is all about reopening despite working in edu/nursing and having full capacity to understand how bad this is. Opinions are definitely tied to their politics. Desperate for advice on how to speak with them without losing it.

 Handled poorly Our government has handled this so poorly that it’s insane.... I see how and why people are angry that others are irresponsibly going to bars and nightclubs beaches etc, but why are these establishments even open? How are people supposed to take any of this serious when place like subway and fast food chains that handle money and then make food are still operating and their favorite restaurants are open? the virus is spreading and it’s spreading faster this combined with irresponsible people is what’s going to dig a hole for us we need to lockdown and it needs to happen ASAP

 Look at the data coming out of smallest westernized wealthy countries.....Are their rates a better representation of what is happening in the larger wealthier countries? Luxembourg, San Marino, Lichtenstein, Isle of Man, Faroe Islands, Gibraltar...the data points to very very high numbers per capita. Are these figures in these micro countries more representative of what the actual number of cases are in other westernized countries? And if so, why? Do these smaller countries have a huge ability to screen for viruses as their autonomy relies on having their population healthy?

 People are so DUMB Italy’s healthcare infrastructure has completely shut down. Iv read countless stories of people being isolated in their homes with their dead relatives stuck with nothing to do with the bodies because no funeral homes will come take it, ambulances will not come to get people and the hospitals are at max capacity. If we don’t seriously contain this it’ll happen in the US too. Our healthcare, hospitals will never have the space to keep up with it 

The death rate is estimated to be 3% for those who get it. I read an article earlier saying that top physicians predict 70-150 million people will contract this virus in the US. That is 4.5 million deaths. 4.5 MILLION. That won’t be all old people. Virus’s mutate as they progress. Virus’s can become deadlier as time goes on. 

I don’t understand why people are still trying to down play this.

 Border closures/restrictions (both state and national) aren't actually that bad, especially if we're going to be in this for the long run. Here's how they could make it work. Using NY as an example...

NY/NJ/CT have been acting as one for such purposes, and I see no reason why that would change here, so assume they're acting as a block.  The NY/NJ and NY/CT borders are thus not affected by this, but anything else is fair game.  I'll let other people define the exterior borders of NJ and CT; NY is below.

On I-190 at the Peace Bridge, the ramps to/from the Peace Bridge are in the process of being removed, with the park being expanded to encompass the former customs area.

At the Rainbow Bridge, Niagara Falls State Park has been expanded.  The bridge is preserved as a monument to what was, with people even allowed to walk 3/4 the distance between land and the border in the center of the river.

NY 182 has been truncated to NY 104, the Whirlpool Bridge no longer in use.

I-190 has been truncated.  NYSDOT is studying and project to modify the endpoint of the interchange.  Under this proposal, the Niagara Scenic Parkway would be removed south of I-190.  Between Findlay Drive and the NY 104 RIRO at Devil's Hole State Park, the roadway would be retained, becoming an extension of Whirlpool Drive, which would end at NY 104; north of there, it would become a multi-use path and overlook on the dam.  Both directions of the northern parkway would be modified to flow into the ramp system to I-190, with four lanes of travel restored between I-190 and the end of the current two-lane section south of Lewiston.  Alternative 1 would see I-190 flow into these ramps to end at NY 104 and flow into the Parkway; alternative 2 would modify the existing interchange into a trumpet, retaining the bigger loop.

The Wolfe Island-Cape Vincent ferry was terminated.

The Thousand Islands Bridge, each main span connecting to an island, is still in use; however, the border crossing was closed and the bridges across the International Rift between Wellsley Island and Hill Island were removed.  With significantly reduced traffic volumes, NYSDOT truncated I-81 to NY 12 on the mainland, with the bridge modified to flow into CR 191 (existing CR 191 was turned into an at-grade access to CR 100).  The former alignment of I-81 on the Island acts as a trail, with a local group working to secure funding to retain one carriageway as a formal trail (access via the former exit 51 and 52 ramps) and to remove the other.  On the Ontario side, ON 137 was downloaded, and no longer exists south of Benson Park Road.  The St. Lawrence River is frequently patrolled and crossing is banned, however travel is allowed between the Lake of the Isles and the US part of the river provided people traverse the narrow international section with the utmost expediency and do not interact with Canadian boaters.

NY 812 was truncated to NY 37; the former bridge access south of the correctional facility has been retained on one carriageway as a reference route.

The Seaway International Bridge remains one of the only border crossings between the countries still in use, due to an Indian Reservation that crosses the border and treaty rights allowing the tribe to cross.  The area is very heavily patrolled, being a hotspot for Americans trying to illegally immigrate to Canada.  Discussions about transferring territory from one country to another are ongoing, but slow.  NY 37C, NY 95, and county routes are being explored as an alternate alignment of NY 37 should the territory become Canadian.

The border crossings between New York and Québec have been blocked.  NY 30 is unchanged, but NY 189 has been decommissioned entirely, I-87 truncated to US 11 (with a potential project to remove the roadway to the north and reconnect Garceau Road to Moore Street), US 9 truncated to US 11, NY 276 decommissioned, and US 11 ending at US 2, a situation allowed to persist because there aren't many alternatives, none of them all that great.  One that has gained some traction is to extend US 2 along NY 9B and truncate US 11, although NYSDOT is hesitant to extend it given that it duplicates NY 2.

On the NY/VT border, the checkpoint routes are US 2, former NY 314, NY 185, US 4, NY 22A, NY 149, NY 313, and VT 279.  All other roads are barricade routes.

On the NY/MA border, the checkpoint routes are NY 2, NY 43, US 20, I-90 (with MassPike exit 1 modified to be bi-directional), and NY 23.  All other routes are barricade routes.  Taconic State Park is patrolled to prevent it being used for illegal entry.

On the NY/PA border, the checkpoint routes are I-90, US 20, NY 474, NY 426, PA 958, US 62, US 219, NY 305, NY 19, NY 36, I-99, PA 14, NY 282, NY 26, NY 7, US 11, I-81, NY 79, PA 191, Callicoon Bridge, PA 371, NY 52, PA 434, US 6/US 209, and I-84.  All others are barricades unless noted below.

Special mention for the situation near Waverly: due to how the freeway crosses the border, some of the checkpoints and barricades do not match the state borders.  At US 220, the PA checkpoint is south of NY 17, which NY has three checkpoints: former US 220 and both ramps to NY 17 (barricades on River Road west of US 220, Fulton street under NY 17, and Keystone Avenue over NY 17).  The checkpoint on NY 34 is north of the border, but the road is partitioned with jersey barriers so that traffic from PA is forced into the right lane and traffic turning left from NY 17 east bypasses it in the left lane.

 Is it wrong to call COVID-19 the China Virus? Considering it’s China’s fault for not shutting down and containing “wet markets” where new viruses seem to continuously emerging, tried to coverup the illness, attempted to blame US for it, etc.

++++++++++
 We need to step up and change our behavior. This pandemic started in China and spread because of the Chinese government. They will be held accountable, and it can start with you! 

Stop buying cheap plastic trash from China that will just end up in the Pacific Ocean anyway, hold your local government accountable to support local businesses, hold your state representative accountable for how they handle the situation now and after this crisis and let’s rise from this mess with a lesson learned. That lesson is that communist governments are still alive and well and they are a threat to the world and we cannot be ignorant. 

It starts with being aware, then making the changes possible to your lifestyle. Saying “everything” is made in China is not true, mostly unessential trash is made in China. Simply refuse to spend your dollar on an item made in a communist country. Your dollar is your vote. Sure it’s cheaper, but what is the cost of freedom? 

Democracy is difficult. Don’t be racist, the strength of a democracy comes from welcoming everyone and having a diverse background of hardworking individuals driven by the American dream. Consequently, this is also a weakness that communists can play on by using spies and espionage, but being racists will not help. Being aware and having good business models and internal relationships will help to fight espionage. The price of lies will catch up to communist ideologies, trust the process and trust your foreign neighbors. Make them feel at home and they will be more likely to support our democracy.

 What do you think the President could have done better to control the virus? There is a lot of talk about how bad President Trump handled the pandemic so far. But I can't help but ask what exactly he did wrong. He started with the restrictions of flights coming in from China before any other country (excluding Taiwan). Then he started with local restrictions pretty much at the same time as any other first world country. In fact, the restrictions in the US came in before they came in for Europe (excluding Italy and probably Spain). We were then in a state of shutdown pretty much everywhere. At some point he started talking about opening the economy, but he didn't do anything, did he? The government provided economical support for people who lost their jobs-this was a lot of people and I'm not sure if the government could have provided more money to those people. 

So what exactly would you say President Trump did incorrectly when handling this virus? What do you think other politicians would have done better? If I compare the approaches taken in France, Germany and Canada with those taken in the United States, I don't really see differences. In fact the restrictions in the States were even a bit harder than in the other countries. The difference I do notice is the way individuals were behaving. Indeed, I got the feeling that people in the US were being less responsible than people in the other countries.

 This Virus Is Showing Peoples True Faces When/if all this dies down I really hope we have woken up to the shit this country has put us through. They literally saw this coming from thousands of miles away and did nothing. They could have stopped planes coming from China and other affected areas. If you recall there was a ban on Iran and other places because "they might be terrorists" Two of the people who are apart of our government whose job is to lead us sold all their stocks when they heard whatever they heard in the private conference. (One of which was from my home state and that old whore sold about 3 million dollars in stock) Also, as I read through some of the other posts I see several companies still aren't doing shit for their employees. To the people saying "what about my rent?" No one is stupid enough to evict you now. And when/if we going into a nation wide lockdown what are they going to do? They can't legally kick you out once that happens. Folks, protect yourselves. You are literally working in a life threatening condition. I really hope when/if this goes away that we remember what these people did to us. I hope for the first time in this nation's history we stand up and hold these people accountable. I don't mean go killing anyone or anything like that but, for the love of god we wake up and see that this corporate ran government doesn't and hasn't given a single shit about us in a very long time.

If we live through this and totally forget about it like we often do then we deserve to be treated this way.

 The USA, Canada, the UK, indeed most countries, will have to just give citizens money for a prolonged period in an Andrew Yang inspired guaranteed income policy. And the good thing is, this can be done and it will work to preserve people's well being and bring back the economy. Of course, Mr. Yang did not invent the idea of a guaranteed income, but he is one of the recent proponents of it.

This is what will be needed - just giving people money.  And guess what they will do with that money?  They'll spend it.  And that will slowly bring back our economy.  

This will need to happen.  Not one or two packages that might give people the equivalent of a few weeks of minimum wage pay.  People will need a reliable check from the government for a prolonged period.

The good thing is that this can be done.  We live in what is essentially a managed economy.  At the end of all this, whether its 6 months from now or 24 months from now, things will be very bad.  We may indeed meet the criteria to call it a global depression.  But there is no reason that we can't kick start things.

If we solve the medical issue with medical interventions, and give people money starting as soon as possible, we can lessen the impact and get things moving again.

Why did you enter into the earth, **Coronavirus**? What led you to grow up at such a faster speed that scientists are even not getting the necessary amount of time to aware people of the proper precautions?   


Do you know how many innocent people have been suffering due to you? Mostly in China, many brothers and sisters haven’t been able to survive only because of you.

I don’t know what harmful elements you’re made up of that you can just cause even death to a person within a fraction of second or in no time, but I just want you to go away from the lives of human beings and bring back the freedom to live life ordinarily as everything was before.

 Panic shopping solution So I’m in know way a big-brother supporter but we have a problem.

I understand the panic. I understand people wanting to feel as though that can provide and protect. That’s not easy when most people shop on a daily basis.

Of course people will buy in abundance, they would be stupid and careless if they do not. But now the shelves are empty.

With shit hitting the fan I would hope someone in authority has considered rationing when the stores get restocked. I’m not talking about bread lines. I’m talking about one person buying 100 lbs of rice and a cart full of pasta.
 Hopefully  my point is being made without striking nerves.

I had been dousing a paper towel with the stuff and wiping things down that way. It worked, but was less than convenient.

Bought a soft-sided pop-top package of baby bum wipes today, opened it up, and poured a good slug of Everclear in.

Definitely  better than what is been doing.

Took the precaution of keeping it inside a gallon sized zip lock bag to prevent evaporation.

The entire world is literally working on this vaccine, I know  it is extremely hard to create one but with the world in emergency mode right now, we must have so many smart people working literally around the clock 24/7. We have never seen such a combined effort before from mankind...

Will it still take more than a full year? I just feel like we have way too many people working on this around the clock for a full year to still be the fastest time we can get a vaccine.

Now someone in the comments please call me a bumbling idiot and tell me why i'm wrong!

 Stop panic buying. You're going to end up hurting people. You guys are all pretending your saints because you want to stay home but there are people who cannot afford to live when you panic buy. People who are dealing with health issues, or elderly who can only go to the store every so often, or people are living on government aid can't get the supplies they need because the stores are sold out of everything.

I have a friend with RA (he's only 30 it's sad) and it's painful for him to move, he lives on government aid so he saves up his money and then goes out and buys a bunch of stuff to get him through the next month or two but he can't because normal people are going out and panic purchasing. So now he has to go to the store every week and buy perishables and it's hard for him to do that. I would help him if he didn't live on the opposite coast. 

There isn't a toilet paper shortage. There isn't going to be a toilet paper shortage. There isn't a food shortage. There's just as much toilet paper and food in the market as they're always is. The only issue right now is that people are hoarding it. Stop

 A Part of What's Wrong with US... If this pandemic has taught me one thing, it is that Americans can be incredibly selfish, reckless, and entitled. We are willing to risk other people's lives and health because we want to be comfortable and entertained. We don't want to wear a mask because "it feels weird". We don't want to stay home because we're bored and tired of being cooped up. We are not willing to temporarily sacrifice our comforts and desires because it is somehow an affront to our freedom. We are not willing to listen to the scientists, doctors, and experts because this is all just a hoax and a liberal conspiracy. We were willing to reopen as quickly as possible because we want to "save the economy" at the expense of other people's lives and safety. We are just not willing to think about anyone beyond ourselves.

The selfishness, recklessness, and entitlement are why our country currently has 4 million cases and approximately 150,000 deaths. The saddest part is that we have become so desperate for things to return back to "normal" to the point that we are desensitized to these numbers. I know that it sounds like I am saying the same thing over and over again, but the overall message is that if we want any meaningful way of containing this virus, we must be willing to make sacrifices and resist our temptations.

 Doctors/Nurses vs Military Many people have great respect for military men and women. They volunteer to protect our country. When there's an enemy and we're at war they at the ones risking their lives defending us. But many also dismiss the military. Saying, "hey the signed up for it..." Saying, "they're not risking their lives..." Saying, "why should we support them when they are part of the evil military complex..."

Hmmm, well, right now just replace doctors/nurses for the military. Sound familiar? These doctors/nurses signed up for this. And yes they are part of the evil healthcare industry that denies health coverage for people and charges $500 for a cotton swab. But now the doctors/nurses are fighting to protect us against an invisible enemy.

So, let us take this opportunity to remind ourselves that there are some professions/careers/callings that do require people to be patriotic, to risk their lives to protect ours. Whether it's military, police or doctors and nurses. 

For too long many of hated our military for the very reasons they now love our doctors and nurses.

 I don’t understand what warrants all those responses. Please explain to me, I don’t get it. Hi all,

I would like someone to explain to me, like i’m 5 years old, the reason for this huge response to this Coronavirus situation.

Please be respectful, I am genuinely clueless and completely overwhelmed. I don’t understand at all why it is such a big deal. I’m not stupid, maybe misinformed, but I want to understand.

I don’t know what the deal is and why people panic in Italy for this Coronavirus situation. But it’s real and it’s happening: Italy is extending its coronavirus quarantine measures, which include a ban on public gatherings, to the entire country. 

The entire country! Everyone stays at home and people can go out only for work or emergencies.

I’m a 40 years old male, mechanical engineer in a aerospace company. I live in Quebec, Canada.

I feel stupid, like there’s something I don’t understand.  I feel like everyone is taking this situation seriously except me. However the facts are presented, I just can’t understand why there is such overwhelming response.

Why there are cities, provinces and countries which completely stops living, which limits the movements of citizens to the maximum.

Am I wrong in thinking that if I catch this virus, I will have minor flu symptoms ? I rest, drink water and I will be healed.  It's the same for 99% of people. I’m not afraid at all, should I be ? Two persons in their 70s from Quebec caught the virus on a cruise ship and are now completely healed.

Theorize, hypothesize this situation; if there’s no response at all and everyone keeps living normally, there will be a pandemic and a lot of people will catch covid19, then there will be people sick also people dying, but we don’t know how much, and it will be a bit more than the flu but definitely not in a scale compared to a war, cancer, car accident or other cause of death. Why are we changing all our lives for this ?

Can you explain why people need to stop working, stopping the economy, canceling events and all that if the disease will only make very little people sick ?

The pros and cons are clear in my opinion: just keep living normally but with enhanced awareness and attention for cleanliness.

So if I understand correctly, the only reason why whole countries confines themself and avoids public gatherings is to limit the transmission of the virus, which will then protect the 0.8-1.5% of people who can develop serious symptoms, it  is that right?

Thank you very much for you explanations and your patience.

What bothered me were the comments. They're not normal, right?

 “They signed up for it” I’m on the frontlines, working in the local emergency room. This is a pet peeve of mine.  Saying healthcare workers signed up for this.  They did not sign up to work without proper protection and basic safety measures.  Jeopardizing their life’s and potentially their families life’s.  Yes there’s always been a risk, but that doesn’t mean someone signed a dotted line saying you wouldn’t have the tools or resources to manage the risk.  

That’s like saying a solider signed up to fight a war without a gun, or any means to defend himself.  Or a police officer signed up to serve and respond to a shootout in his street clothes, unarmed.

 For those of you who did not believe that the corona virus was a true crisis and that governments and people around the world were grossly overreacting, what changed your mind? I have seen so many people, even friends of mine, basically campaigning online that this is just the government manipulating the people, that the same number of people die from the flu, and that there is no real crisis, it's all just hype and sensationalized reporting. For those of you who used to think that the corona virus wasn't a big deal, what information did you encounter that changed your mind into believing that this is a true global crisis that warrants the extreme actions of our governments?

 I have an idea! And I really think it could potentially work!!! It is so simple :) Hello Reddit, I have an idea, and I hope you all will listen to my idea, and at least consider supporting my idea and POTENTIALLY replicating my tweet with either my exact same tweet, or another one of your choice that hopefully is similar in mission.

Of course, who knows if my idea has any chance at all of working, but it doesn’t hurt to try in my opinion.

Ok, on to my idea.

I just tweeted the following tweet to President Donald Trump. My tweet should not suggest to anyone that I either support Trump or I do not support him. I do not care to discuss my opinion on the matter, because I know it’s a sensitive subject. Instead, I just want to let our President know that I am rooting for him to stop coronavirus from infecting our country, and as an ex-teacher and ex-cross country and track coach, I recognize that everybody needs motivation in life. Everybody needs others to cheer for them. That’s how you get a really good cross country team - when everybody is supporting each other and rooting for each other, it builds a positive culture, and with support, people are motivated to succeed.

In these tough times that I fear could be right around the corner, why don’t we all come together and try to motivate our president to get us out of this coronavirus mess! I really think he can do it if he had everyone’s support. That’s all he needs, is just a bunch of people cheering for him. In my opinion.

Why do I think President Trump is so important for the entire world? Because if President Trump can come to an agreement on getting this disaster taken care of ASAP (and by that I just mean cooperating with world powers to perhaps do a worldwide lockdown, of some limited sort, ASAP, or whatever else they feel is best - obviously it is extremely complicated), I feel VERY CONFIDENT that other world leaders will all follow, and I really believe they can do it!! Please believe with me!!! Cooperation and motivation would not stop all deaths of course, but it could significantly limit them.

Please either copy and paste my tweet, change it up or don’t change it up, depending on whatever you think, retweet it, do whatever you want with it, but please join me in cheering for our president to end this coronavirus mess!!!

Maybe it just might catch on! If it does, why wouldn’t it work????

Hi President Trump,

I would be absolutely thrilled to vote for you in the upcoming elections if you were able to stop the country from a COVID 19 breakout! I promise you that!If you agree with that statement, please replicate it. If you want to change it up to suit your needs, please feel free to. But please consider supporting this mission in just giving our president a little extra motivation. I really feel confident that it will help him, and I think he can do it with all of our support.

 What Do Infected Quarantined People Do With Their Trash?! Does anyone know how the daily trash from an infected person is supposed to be handled? I assume in a hospital it would be considered hazardous waste and contained as such, but with sick people at home is there a proper protocol for disposing of it? Does it just get placed in a can on the curb?! What if it blows around and someone picks it up?!

 Why the USA is not following the western European trend. People need to understand why the USA is different than the other western countries and I don't believe it has anything to do with politics or people.
We have many different states that are each similar to another western country. So as the virus travels around the USA it will keep our numbers high, while other countries will drop like NY did. 
This isn't an excuse not to do everything to stop the virus but it explains how our graph will look different from each individual European country.
Just thought I'll explain this because I haven't seen anyone else mention this point.

 Employers putting "Out if Order" signs on drinking fountains? I work in a machine shop and our employer has put "Out of order. Please do not use." signs on all drinking fountains as well as our on demand purified water station. They function just fine. It baffles me. We have wipes adjacent to each fountain. You literally touch a fountain in one location, maybe two if you use the opposite hand for support. They are instead buying pallets of bottled water and occasionally putting bottles out a dozen at a time. 
I asked management what the logic is. "Some people may not wipe off the fountain" Okay, so people who care can grab a wipe and use the wipe to press the plunger and wipe it after. Ideally everyone should but so be it. "With the filtered water some people may put there bottle right up to the nozzle to refill it and they may not wipe off the buttons." So teach them the correct way to use the machine. 
When I pointed out the someone who is distributing the bottles still has to touch the bottles I got hit with "Well HR washes their hands." Really? The ladies who share lunch and run out for coffee are distributing the bottles? Wonderful.

Anybody else dealing with people this inept? It's so short sighted and expensive. We dont have recycling bins for the plastic bottles. We could instead provide company cups and teach people how to use the filtered water machine properly.

 What lessons have you learned so far? Me: It's very difficult to aim a rifle with a full-face mask on because the filters prevent your cheek from getting close to the butt.

Most people will throw you under a bus when push comes to shove.

SBDs are real.

Shortages are not only possible, but real. Have 6mos of everything stocked.
