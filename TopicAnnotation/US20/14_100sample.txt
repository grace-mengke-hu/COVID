Why are people not recovering here?

Ordering out should be STRICTLY for people without food in their cabinets, not just because you want some damn pizza. If people don’t start caring about their health, the people getting them their food won’t care either.

 Highest Hope My highest hope for what follows from this outbreak is increased economic and social equality in the US.  I hope that the obvious indiscriminate and violent nature of the virus fosters a spirit of brother/sisterhood while highlighting the vast disparities we all encounter socially and economically.  Many of us live paycheck to paycheck with no health insurance.  Specifically, I hope it leads to universal healthcare in the US and an increased social safety net with a tax code more focused on the poor and middle classes.  We’re all in this together - both during and _after_ the outbreak, just as we were before, whether we could see it or not.  _That’s_ how you make a country great again.

 Restaurant business getting crushed I spoke to one of my clients yesterday.  He owns 54 Denny's and 73 Burger Kings.  Banks gave him $40,000,000 last week as sales were down 80%.  The crazy part is he doesn't need to pay back that money AND he says by May 15 if business isn't back open, he will have to go BK for sure.  On all the Denny's.  Burger King should make it as they have figured out a way to scale way down, just drive through and sales are down closer to 25% than 80%.     

We help get small and large companies financed so half our clients are absolutely getting smacked right now.  Uncharted territory so be safe amigos.  Be smart and best of luck to all of us. I do not think this virus is bad for 99% of us.  My wife is a doctor, they have not let her into work for 20 days as she had the classic symptoms (but light symptoms) including the fact she couldn't taste for 7 days.  She actually agreed to drink all the crappy coffee neither of us like so that was a positive.  Last Thursday I had shortness of breath, had body aches.. I assume I had it... I didn't feel bad but had these symptoms (i didn't lose my taste)... On the 4th day (Sunday) I went for a walk and tried to sprint... I'm in good shape but I had insane Wheezing and tightness of chest/lungs so my guess is, I have it now.  

My wife won't let me waste a test because people like me, who are not bad, they just send home anyway.  In 3 weeks Quest will have enough blood tests to check antibodies to confirm we had the virus. 

The country needs to open up.  If they wait 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, the virus will be out there.

 Source to find pneumonia/sepsis deaths not attributed to any specific pathogen? Hello, I remember before coronavirus was getting coverage heavy, I saw an article about more sepsis deaths and pneumonia deaths towards the end of the year in the US.

My take on this - coronavirus  and re infection potential are going to be worse in second/third waves because of previous circulation of strains.

 It's been reported that immunity/antibodies last (supposedly) around 2 to 3 months. If reinfection is possible, we should start seeing evidence of that quite soon from those that contracted it in Feb/March, right? The information is still highly conflicted, but at this point, we should have cases of people who contracted it, "recovered" and feel close to 100%, but then experience symptoms again (and possibly worse than the first time). I've seen plenty of anecdotal stuff on /r/covid19positive but I think we should start seeing people people show up in hospitals again, if it's indeed possible to get it again (and this quickly).

 The Authority &amp; Governments Are Making Many Big Mistakes Over The Corona Virus COVID-19 NCOV **The Authority &amp; Governments Are Making Many Big Mistakes Over The Corona Virus COVID-19 NCOV**

I just want to tell the hard truth so hopefully they can change for the better, or otherwise many nations will disappear because of this corona virus for sure.

Here are the big mistakes of many big international groups &amp; national governments:

**1. Censorship**  
 If you cannot face the truth and tell the real problems, but only cover/hide it and expect it will “miracle go away”, then you would utterly wrong.  
 

First, the China covered it up, that is why is spread worldwide.  
 Second, the Western Government covered it up as well, they censored all kind of theory about this virus online. That is why their citizens did not fear and now is crazy deadly situation after the corona virus fully touch down their land.

**2. Underestimate, Do Not Respect The New Corona Virus NCOV**  
 I have said and warned the dangerous of this virus, but all of you were deleted my only text-base theory post. Now it turned out it all the fact and hard truth.

**If any scientist and/or authority, government can prove my theory about this corona virus is wrong, I would close my websites instantly !!!**

**3. Listening False Prophets Instead Of The Savior**  
 Many secret societies and governments know what the hex are they doing, many of them are listening to false prophet/fortune teller, etc. Instead of facing the hard truth.

I as the savior will never play encrypt message, only a direct straight forward communication.

You have more chance to survive if you listen to any entities can tell “have cure/solution” for the problems instead of rely on “safe choice” who only tell you “try, not sure it work”.

That are the 3 big major mistakes the authorities are making, if they do not change, then they will collapse and die because of this corona virus NCOV for sure.

The rich the elite, government officials will gone first for ignore the savior Messiah, then latter to the poor.

Hopefully, they can wake up and change for the better.

Best Regard,  
**The Savior**

 Trumps new travel ban doesn’t seem thought out without enough testing?? [removed]
++++++++++
 Wal-Mart and Coronavirus  Let me start by stating I'm indifferent to the state of the outbreak. I'm a college student in my twenties, confident in my survival abilities, and while I acknowledge it is a problem, I'm not panicking like a great many people are. That being said, I have nothing against the preventative measures being taken. Isolation is a nice change of pace.

That being said, the ones I'm concerned about are my parents. My mother is in her early 60's and my father is in his 70's. He retired a couple years ago, but my mother has been working at Wal-Mart. She's been employed there for the past 14 years and is a department manager. As someone who is of a greater risk of suffering legitimate/mortal harm from the potential virus, I'd actively encourage my mother to stay home. Unfortunately, I've read Wal-Mart's policy about the whole situation and it sucks. My parents are in a precarious financial situation and can't afford to have my mother not being paid. As a college student paying my own way, what little I can do to help isn't enough.

Is there anything that can be done? I'd prefer to have her stay home, as is being encouraged everywhere, but they literally can't afford the financial blow. Is there any action, legal or otherwise, that can be taken? I believe a great deal of this whole situation is blown out of proportion, but I also acknowledge that it's very real, and there's still a chance of getting it. I don't mind if it's me who gets sick, but my parents could very much die. My mother is being forced to work in a situation that's actively discouraged by the general population. I just feel it's ridiculous how half-hearted Wal-Mart's policies are regarding taking time off for this. She's not a temp worker looking for time off either. She's been there for over a decade, and has been a loyal employee. She works hard and is well liked by her coworkers. Now it just feels like Wal-Mart is using her as much as they can until she either leaves for her own safety or dies.

Okay, I guess this is more of a rant than an actual question. I'm just kind of pissed.

 Black people don't get Coronavirus. For some background I live with my 63 year old grandmother in California. She has diabetes, lung problems (has nebulizer), has a permanent colostomy bag, and heart issues. She has a tub full of medication that she takes. Over a dozen. And she smokes. Essentially she's fucked if she catches the virus. 

I've been attempting to keep the old hag in the house for the longest. She thinks the antibiotics she has for her ear infection will help against the *virus* and cure it, but I had to rain down on her parade and inform her that antibiotics do NOT work against viruses. I also had to inform her that there were no vaccines nor cures at the moment, and the least health officials can do is treat the symptoms. Ugh.

It was announced in the news that two cities 30 minutes and 1 hour away respectively have had their first confirmed cases of the virus. No doubt about it, it's here in my city as well. She acted shocked when they restated it again this afternoon, even though she told me this morning, because for some reason or another, "I thought it was a mistake." *Inhales*. Tomorrow, I'm going to the store as soon as they open to stock up on what I can. Gotta get some more food, and some stuff for the dog. Might stop by home depot for some lumber. Lots of homeless around and I'm worried about looting. Can't buy a gun because I'm under 21 and it's California.

A few minutes ago, my mother called her from Arkansas. I tried to tell her to stock up on nonperishable food items. Not only did she completely brush aside my warnings, she also stated some of the dumbest shit I've ever heard in my entire life. "You don't need no mask or hand sanitizer. Black people don't get the virus. It's all these white people and asians it's killing. Black people got stronger genes. You don't hear about any black people getting it. You better be careful because they trying to harvest our organs." Paraphrased, but you get the point. You can't make that shit up. My jaw was dropped to the fucking floor. How the ever living fuck? Thankfully, my grandmother didn't believe that 'theory', but I unfortunately what she said next wasn't much better. "Everybody know this Coronavirus was made by Putin. Him and Donald Trump. He paid Donald Trump to let the virus in and kill all the poor people. The poor black people and the mexicans since he's mad they won't let him build that wall along the border. They did it, and Putin gave him the antidote."

I legitimately have no words at the moment.
