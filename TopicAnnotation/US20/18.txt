 This isn’t bragging, just to remind people that it only takes a little to make a difference. I wanted to spend the day at the mall, get my favorite meal, and enjoy myself and read my new book. I have spent $60 tipping 3 different local businesses to go on top of my $15 lunch. I slipped it in and I don’t think anyone noticed when I did. I live in Florida, we rely on tourists as an economic structure, and with the situation causing businesses to close down for a time, those that stay open have an even bigger risk as they are barley making money. I live with my parents, I have an easy enough job, and I have more money than I need. I am more than proud to support these people trying to feed themselves and their families, trying to hold onto their businesses, and their success. It’s not much, but I hope that others are giving tips as much as they can spare. Even a dollar makes a difference, when you can only have 50 people in your place of business. Good luck to anyone who’s struggling. I believe in you and I hope you make it through.

 Am I the only one who doesn’t have any hope in our government? I’ll be damned if US gets ahold/contain the virus in any way compared to Singapore or china or any other nation actually doing shit.
Mainly cause I genuinely believe the government couldn’t give two fucks about the people. 

What do you guys think?

 How far will the USA go to put a stop to this ? Obviously there is no way of putting a date on when we will see an end to this. I guess for me the bigger question is , how far will the Government/State go to try to stop it. 

Given that the people of the United States have for the most part more "rights" as human beings. Lots of those people are already trying to exercise those 
"rights" by setting up BBQS in their favorite restaurants parking lots , among other dumb ideas. 

Now, other countries are taking things into their own hands. Doing things to control the herd that would completely violate our "rights".  I guess this is what it took for those countries to try to start a downward trend. 

How true these claims are on other countries practices are ??? I don't know. 
But, apparently....

China forcefully locking up the sick in camps and welding doors shut for a duration of time 

India policing the outdoors and hitting violators with sticks 

Philippine  President calling to "shoot them dead" if breaking curfew.  

So, unless the USA goes to any of these measures, how can media, CDC, or anyone try to predict the "curve" we are waiting for ?  If this is what other countries had to resort to, how can we compare timelines with their results ?  Obviously there are just too many citizens that lack common sense but love to exercise their rights. 
Martial Law maybe only end in sight, which really sucks for those of us that are trying to be smart. 

We are fucked.

 Large gatherings... At what point do we stop getting mad at these covid idiots for going out to bars, parties, large gatherings, ect. and start blaming the governor’s for opening too soon/not shutting down when covid cases spike? I keep seeing the news report on these large parties people are having like the Sturgis rally and holiday parties but literally nothing is getting done to punish people?? Basically as long as things are open, people are going out and living life like normal and most don’t follow guild lines. I just wish the government would step up and try to help cases from getting out of control. 

I watched a youtube video of a girl from Florida who got covid from going to a bar and she explained how she didn’t even do anything wrong, she went out to a place that was legally open and she and 30 other people contracted the virus. BUT FLORIDA IS STILL OPEN?!?! Yes she should have been smarter but honestly, most people are dumb and think that because things are open, covid is gone. Are you kidding me.

 Any redditors that are “high-risk” for Covid-19 that have completely changed their lifestyle? Tons of jokes, memes, and gifs that make fun of everyone living at home and not being able to live normal lives. I’d like to hear the stories of people who were most susceptible that chose to change their lives because they could. Weight-loss, diet changes, more exercise. Or mental health; re-kindled relationships, meditated, became better communicators.

 Life of a Millennial parent during covid Ex wife drops daughter off at 7:50 M-F and stays until 5 PM.

Daycare is still not open, nor do I want my daughter going to school with other kids until a vaccine is provided (I don’t see how they can cut class size by 50%). I want to respect our governor’s decisions that are based on science and not the almighty economy that we revere so much in the US, I hope one day I can invest and build an adequate life for my family, it seems like a pipe dream at this point for most of us. Hell, I’d even take a round of golf, but the guilt of spending any money on myself anymore will prevent me from doing so.

Haven’t received unemployment in 8 weeks, still waiting on a “open monetary issue” and haven’t been able to get a single response or phone call through to the unemployment office.

I did bite the bullet and got a part time job at a local sandwich shop and I am very thankful for the opportunity to go work and make money, even though it’s going to put myself and my family at risk, and not to mention it’s going to be a 3rd of the amount of money that I will need to pay for bills. A cell phone is starting to seem like a luxury I can’t afford either.

My Congressman, Bill Huizenga is a complete egocentric, money hungry Republican that could care less about any of these issues. 20 emails and I still haven’t received a genuine, non automated response. I get Republicans want less government control but this is absolute ridiculous at this point.

I take solace with the fact that the people with little money are doing more for each other than they should have too, and it really inspires me to try to create a better life for my daughter and I so we can use our good fortune to make the lives of people who really, really need it.

At this point, I do have shelter, food, water, and fire. The basic elements of survival, I am very thankful for that.

Our founding fathers would be shaking their heads in shame at what we’ve become as a country.

I pray that the people at the top on the red side of the aisle and the people that support them start looking around at what the actual problems in the country are. This isn’t the fucking Apprentice! This is real fucking life! Start acting like it!

Millennials aren’t lazy, the generations before us have “drained the swamp” alright, to the point that most of us don’t have any chance of catching a fish for ourselves anymore.

Back to normal is the last thing this country needs. Capitalism has failed us all!

 Is it possible Do you Know the Corona virus is not a fuckin virus 🙄🙄🙄 it’s 5G that’s actually killing people and not a “virus” 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️ they are trying to get u scared of a fake ass virus when it the 5G towers being built around the world. China was the first to have over 100,000 5G towers, and people in Wuhan were the first to get affected by it. This 5G shit was planned years ago to depopulate us and keep as at a low vibrational state. Bill gates is the one who created this along with the weird entities who control this world. He also is creating a vaccine for this so called corona virus that they are going to try to enforce on everyone. These Vaccines are actually chips that they are trying to implant in billions of people across the world. They can literally monitor all ya actions, movements, whereabouts, and thoughts through these lil micro chips. Not only that they can end ya life through them micro chips with the push of a button. They know in order to have millions of people take these vaccines they first need to create a fake virus. Smh it grinds my fuckin gears that you humans are brainwashed enough to believe wtf the news and media puts out there. WAKE TF UP and start researching the truths behind these weird agendas they keep creating. Y’all really out there with masks and shit on WHEN IT AINT NO DAMN VIRUSSSSSS. These Chinese doctors and people you see on TV that’s so called affected by the virus ARE ALL ACTORS, this shit is scripted out LITERALLY. It’s 5G towers that’s killing people and no mask in the world can prevent them levels of radiation from frying your brain. If we don’t wake tf up NOW this shit finna really kill us smh 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️ but of course y’all gonna think I’m crazy for saying this too right ??? Smh Fuckin Robots is what y’all are, legit programmed robots ‼️

 TheWorld.Data.Blog Is Providing Cure Solution, Real Knowledge About Corona Virus NCOV COVID-19 **TheWorld.Data.Blog Is Providing Cure Solution, Real Knowledge About Corona Virus NCOV COVID-19**

The authority, government and many  organization are hiding a lot of real info about the new corona virus  from the public for whatever reasons like lose the regime, cause chaos  or continue enslave the people, not just only China, Vietnam must also  including USA, Europe, etc. All over place.

So if you are seeking for the truth  information, real knowledge, uncensored news, open discussion, cure  &amp; solution for the new corona virus named as NCOV, COVID-19 or  SARS-COV-2, then the only webpage online is **theworld.data.blog** and **freejoy.aimoo.com**.

The fact is that the media &amp;  government are toying with people’s life. They are only promoting fear  and scare to face the truth. They were not telling the real information  about the corona virus from the beginning and probably in the future as  well.

Even I as a Savior want to telling you the  truth, real information about this epidemic with just text-based  message, they think me as fear-maker, and delete all the messages  online. Many of my information now even scientist was confirmed like the  started for this epidemic event from October/November or the real  features of this virus, but many still not yet confirmed and verified  yet.

If they say cannot talk in the public or  big media sites, then it would be ok, but instead they are deny in all  fake free speech websites as well.

You need to understand that even the top  government officials, top doctors who have access to top notch medical  care had died because of this new corona virus, they cannot protect  themselves so there is freaking any reason they can protect normal  people like most of you.

The new corona virus is not yet peak, the  full strength of that virus will only appear in the summer time. The  current situation is too dangerous for normal people to deal with.

That why from now I will provide free  working cure &amp; solution at private matter for all of you, if you are  rich (have more than 5 millions USD worth of asset) then you must  donate money, but all with restrict conditions and limited time. But  only at **theworld.data.blog** or **freejoy.aimoo.com**.

But if you are willing to open your mind,  want to face the scary hard truth, accept new knowledge then you can  visit that websites. If you are the anti-christ with big ego and do not  want to change, then do not visit.

Remember everything has the limit and I have the final decision of anything on that website.

The authority cannot save you, only you  can save you, and only the savior can give you real working advice, cure  &amp; solution to overcome this crazy epidemic event.

Best Regard,

**The Savior Messiah Mahdi Maitreya Kalki Christ Any-Name**
