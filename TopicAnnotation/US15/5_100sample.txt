 Dear Leaders, here's how to make a mask rule so that people stop dying, from a former school principal, just sayin... Dear Trump , Pence,  and Governors, In case you actually want  businesses to open and people to stop dying, here's a "primer" on how to make a rule that people care about and follow. If you do this, maybe we can stop watching our fellow citizens melting down at Trader Joes as thousands of our loved ones die needlessly.          

Making a rule that requires everyone to adopt a new behavior, such as wearing a mask, is possible, even in a culture that perceives the rule as an infraction of "their rights". I realize that some of you just don't give a crap about how many people are getting sick. Bust just in case, here you go...  Here's the philosophy, with  school examples:        



1) The rule must be enacted as both a "top-down" and a "grassroots" rule. **School Example:** "all students  at Roosevelt High School  must carry a pass when they travel throughout the school without an adult"                 

 The principal, the head dean, whoever is that top person, must "declare" that it is now a rule. - The teachers and staff must help to enforce it, and the students will have to buy into it. Here's the good news: it will work even if 5% of the community does not comply. This is based on the PBIS (positive behavior intervention supports) model.         

In some organizations, the leader must define the rule as "mandatory" , "legal" , or " critical"  in order to get compliance. If the leader says "encouraged" , you might as well forget the rule. **School Example:**  "Students, it is highly encouraged that you do not use your phone during class instruction."   VS. "Students, it is a mandatory, school-wide rule that you do not use your phone during instruction" . People may question, what is "mandatory" ?  They typically want to hear about the penalty of not following the rule. The good news is that the "penalty" might not need be that harsh, It might just be a big inconvenience.                   **School Example:** "Since we are having trouble following the students-must-carry-a- pass rule, we will have an assembly of all students at 2:00 Friday to review why it is important".                                                      

&amp;#x200B;

2) The leader(s) must give a rationale to everyone, to the people who dislike it the most (students) and to the people who will enforce it (staff). And the rationale must be based in data. School Example: "75% of our school disruptions come from students who leave areas without supervision, here is a graph of the last 500 discipline incidents, notice that 375 of these incidents were students who were traveling within the school without a pass, unsupervised. It is in all of our best interest to have students carry a pass that has been signed by staff."      



3) The leader(s) must be perceived by the community as following the rule themselves: School Example: If the school rule is "no wearing hats inside"  then all adults would have to refrain from wearing hats. ESPECIALLY THE PRINCIPAL .                                                                                                                                               

   4) The adherence, or following of the rule, must be continually be praised and publicly reported, along with the positive results.  School Example:   " This week I checked the hallways, and 90 out of 100 students I asked were carrying a pass. Thank you to all the teachers and students who are making a difference at Roosevelt High School."  This should include all of the other "enforcers" of the rule. "I want to thank Mr. Banks, Ms. Ramirez, and Ms. Chee as our "hallway pass superstars" of the week here at Roosevelt High School."



5) There must be a sense, perceived by all, that a continued disregard of the rule will be addressed. **School Example:** the teacher who continually ignores the rule must have a conversation with the principal, which will likely include a "verbal warning".  



6) Peer Pressure:  Eventually peer pressure must take over the "top-down" pressure. People will feel a sense of order, of fairness, of improvement, because of the collective effort of enacting the new rule. When others blatantly disregard the rule, the community will react with pressure to follow the rule .

 When do you think U.S School students will make a full on-campus return. Things are very mixed up at the moment, some schools are going completely virtual, others are doing a hybrid while having the option for students to do it completely virtual, etc.

I know this is a state by state, county by county, school by school process, but do you think we will begin to see a normal return to school anytime this year? What I mean by this is school running mostly normal. Maybe online is still an option if you it, but every student goes every day of the week, there is no forced social distancing, lunch is eaten as normal, there’s no plexiglass between things, etc. However, maybe masks are still required or optional, things are frequently cleaned, and maybe water fountains aren’t being used still.

I get that this does not online have to do with school, as a gas station is a smaller populated place, yet still may have social distancing signs, plexiglass at the registers, mask requirements, and everything else... however, I would assume places like this would get these restrictions lifted first, before buildings that house lots of people such as schools. 

Now I’m not the most knowledgeable when it comes to this topic, so I ask: are schools not allowed by law to have all of their students return normally? 
If or if not, when do you think they will? Will it happen to middle schools and high schools first, or colleges/universities first? Will there have to be a vaccine out for a few months beforehand. 

Answers and a discussion would be greatly appreciated, I tried to keep this on the shorter side. Thanks!

TL;DR: When will schools make a full return, if so how will they go about this and when do you think it will happen?

 Exchange Students My mom was just in a San Diego Vons, and was talking to another woman in line. Apparently, the US is sending back all foreign exchange students. The woman has an Italian exchange student staying with her, who has been here for several weeks. She said it wasn’t the Italian government taking her (the exchange student) back, but the US government sending her away. I guess she and other exchange families are fighting to keep the kids in the US, since many would be returning to countries that are currently worse hit than ours. 

I don’t hear this convo, hence the grain of salt tag. But I thought I’d share in case anyone knows more since I hadn’t heard anything about this happening besides the second hand account I heard today.

 A child under the age of 5 has died today in Chattanooga, TN My heart is heavy with sorrow seeing the news that yet another child has died. A child that didn’t get a chance to even start school yet.  A child that died alone, in isolation, away from their parents, scared, confused and most likely terrified. Let that sink in for those that still think this is no big deal, that kids aren’t affected by this virus. 

Hug your children tight tonight, tell them how much you love them, how proud you are of them because tomorrow is never a given. Pray for this sweet child’s soul, for this child’s parents and loved ones, for those suffering with coronavirus and their families and the essential workers out there working to keep us safe, fed, alive and their families and loved ones.

 Any valid news about large sex trafficking busts/ rescues going on while shelter in place is happening I keep hearing about large rings of sex trafficking have been busted and thousands of kids being saved but haven't seen any headlines or anything through legit news channels. Also it seems to tie in with something to do with shelter in place going on. I was seeing if there was any validity to this and looking for facts.

 Within a week of reopening, kids at my school got corona. What will happen? So, like the title says, within a week of school reopening there are around 3-4 kids who have already gotten corona and the school has made around 30 kids quarantine.  Basically,  I am wondering if any of you have any insight as to what will happen in the future?  These kids likely spread the corona around the school already, and my guess is there will be more cases soon.  Is the school seriously just going to keep quarantining certain kids and repeat the cycle over and over until the pandemic ends?  I know it’s probably different for every school and varies depending on the area, but do you guys think school in general will last?  It seems very implausible to me.  Any insight will be greatly appreciated!

 How the coronavirus lockdown is hurting students today. there are a lot of students, especially those of minority groups who deeply depend on being at school as a means of their daily living. 

Some students rely on their school to provide them meals in the morning

In the U.S., 22 million students, depend on a free or reduced-price school lunch as a main source of their daily nutrition, according to the School Nutrition Association.

Some children need to be at school to avoid domestic abuse at home

Special needs students need the extra in person support to facilitate their learning. 

Some students need to be at school like adults need to be at work

Schools are scrambling to attend to these kinds of problems and a lockdown is not helping at all.

 My school found a solution Instead of closing school, like what all of the other school district around us have done. My school decided to raise the heat to the max and continue to send us to school. Meanwhile we have a student sent home because of how sick she looked and on top of everything we have mold in our vents. Please send help

 How do you protest in support of the lockdown? Issue is, those protesting against the lockdown are out in the streets, seeming larger than life and accruing media exposure with little/no resistance as everyone who supports it will of course be in doors.

Yet I feel the majority of people are in support of it, but how do you go about showing that support? You can’t exactly go out in the street as you go against your own values. 

Just curious how you’d go about this to show opposition to the covidiots?

 Anyone else hear a “teacher parade” go by today? Apparently teachers nationwide organized “parades” where they drive by their students’ houses and honk a lot.  There were a lot of sirens involved too, so there must have been police participating in the parade in my town.  

Does this strike anyone else as completely asinine?  You really think none of those teachers stood around and grabbed together, before and after and probably in the middle of it at the gas station too?  Kind of defeats the purpose of a lockdown in my mind.

 Possible suggestion for parents who have to work while their children school from home Hi.  This is just a possible suggestion, not sure if it will work for most families but I thought I'd throw it out there in case it may help even a few people out.

I know there are a lot of parents who have to work outside their home but are not comfortable sending their child/ren back to school in-person and there are schools who have chosen to start out the year going a completely virtual route.  If childcare is an issue or if you feel your student will need help with schoolwork during the day and you cannot be there to help them, maybe you can talk to your school district or someone in the community about organizing a group of older responsible/trustworthy high school students to go to a younger students house each day.  If the whole district is online learning and social distancing, there are probably many high schoolers who would welcome the opportunity to do their work in a setting other than their home and it would probably do a lot for their morale right now for them to be able to help out a younger student from their district.  It would also be beneficial to the younger student because the older student was likely taught the same methods in which the younger student is being taught, and would be easier for the younger student to learn from them.  It might also create positive bonds within the varying grade levels of the school district that normally would not have had a chance to form if school was operating on a usual basis.

I feel that if something like this can be implemented, it could effectively create a positive sense of community coming together to get through a crisis by helping one another out and, even though the students are not getting the same level of socialization they would be getting in school, they would still be getting some personal interaction with others and possibly even forming good relationships with older students, which would increase confidence and positivity which they can take back to school with them once school does reopen safely.  I believe there are opportunities, even amid the chaos we are now experiencing, to show the children of this generation that when people band together, do the right thing, help each other and look out for each other, we can accomplish more and overcome more than we think we can.

I'm sure there are some flaws with this suggestion and it might not work for a lot of families, but I thought it may be something that someone might be able to glean an idea from to help them through the issues being faced with having to work while the kids are home.  I know it's tough to navigate these type of things.  I wish you all well and hope your situations work out.

 After having an online conference with my kid's teacher this is what I learned about a parent of a student in the same classroom as my 6yo I was told that a parent at a previous conference suggested having Coronavirus parties to the teacher to "spread it around faster". He also mentioned "sure, some of us might die..." I'm not so sure I want my kids to be in the same school as his kids. Is this response typical to what others have heard?

 Why aren’t we hearing from ethicists on the topic of reopening schools? It seems to me these tough questions that are so difficult to answer such as, how to balance the value of getting children back to school with the risk to teachers’ health (and the kids’ health), are what ethicists deal with on a regular basis. I don’t see them on the news much. I believe they would have invaluable insight for the school administrators, teachers, parents and children that will be making tough decisions very shortly.

 Local condo community- lack of social distancing I live in a condo community in NJ. Since the summer started, about 90% of them have interacted with each other at close quarters outdoors with no masks and no social distancing including groups of kids playing outside like a regular summer with no masks and no distancing. We have been pretty careful avoiding such large groups, masking up etc. However, they seem to be fine. Is there some kind of localized herd immunity at play here?  Or is it just a matter of time before we hear something. I should indicate that most of the people here are in the early 30-early 40s with young children. Could that be a reason?

 What's the difference between a shelter-in-plaxe Vs lockdown in the US? Some states have a shelter-in-place and other countries have a lockdown. What's the difference between the two? 

Currently, in Indiana shelter-in-place or stay-at-home means that people can still go in to work if they are essential researchers/ banks/ grocers, the buses are still running etc. What will happen if there is a lockdown here? Has any US state imposed a lockdown?

 Instead of sending all the kids back to school and risking everyone, can we do a 2 week trial period and see how that goes? It’s irresponsible and inhumane to send kids back to school and using the argument “well it doesn’t affect kids, so it’ll be ok.” I literally had somebody at work tell me that and that it sucks for the teachers that have to go back, but they need to send the kids back to school. Can we do like a two week trial period for all those people who think it’s a good idea to send the kids back? Then they get to see how bad it will be if we do that.

 Taking Kids out of School Voluntarily: Our Principal's Response Today we informed the principal of our kids elementary school that we were taking out kids out of school due to the State of Emergency in Maryland and NIH's recommendation that we avoid large public gatherings. My wife and I then spoke to the Principal by phone. We explained that because of the lack of testing and and our ability to work from home we want to be part of the solution, rather than contributing to what could be a problem.

We understand that not everyone is a position to remove their kids from school, but by reducing the number of kids in school voluntarily we can help reduce the demands put on teachers and the threat to kids still in school and their families.  

We weren't sure how the school would respond. Would we need to withdrawal our kids and start homeschooling? Turns out they are fully supporting our decision and told us it would not affect our kids standing the classroom. Details still needs to be worked out so our kids stay current. The Board of Education is also in the middle of discussing all possible scenarios. 

We are sharing this conversation for anyone else that's also considering taking their kids out of school or thinks this could help in their local community.

 My school reopened and I noticed something straight off the bat No one cares about the rules,if you got to the restroom there’s still kids sharing Juuls and at lunch most kids don’t sit 6 feet apart.after schools even worse most kids take off their masks while walking down the croweded hill. So my question is what’s the point of reopening it just makes cases worse
