 cloth + surgical mask Would it be effective to wear a surgical mask and then a cloth mask over the surgical mask? I have to work a front-desk job in a few weeks and I would like to minimize transmission.

I looked into KN95 masks and it's difficult for me to figure out what brands are credible!

 I see so many people not wearing masks!! :( Why is it that as the numbers of corona cases go up it seems like less and less people are wearing masks? My 10 year old child the other day was asking me do I really need to wear a mask and it kind of shook me... What should I tell my kids?   


Even I don't really know which mask to get and why I need to be wearing one if everyone around me is not wearing one. Does't wearing masks really help us if everyone else is just saying yolo? Also if everyone is not going to wear a mask then which mask should I get for my family and kids so that I can safely protect my family? Thank you for the advice in advance...

 The issue of COVID-19 in the US. Ok, before this I will say I am only 14 so I might not mean a lot to many people. But the situation in the Continental US won’t get any better unless people except the fact that mask are by far the best method we have to stop the spread of COVID. Because no, states creating laws making it mandatory to wear mask in public isn’t denying us of our rights, it is something here to keep us safe. The government isn’t trying to strip the people’s power away. They are trying to get us past this so all you Karen’s can go watch little Johnny play hood little league soccer. They are trying to save lives. Now believe me if you have a better idea that’ll save us, I am all ears. But if not; shut up, and wear a mask for maybe an hour a day. And for sure, don’t complain about it!! You would never complain about having to wear a seatbelt. Which mind you; is a law, in place to protect people’s lives!! So if you believe that it’s fine, then wearing a mask is fine, and won’t take you’re rights as an American citizen. I have to wear a a mask at least 4 hours a day and I haven’t complained in the slightest. So it annoys me when I hear people whining like children over this. It’s people like you that make other countries pity us. And this is ironic; MEXICO HAS SHUT DOWN ITS AMERICAN BORDER BECAUSE OF HOW BADLY AMERICA IS DOING. And the big reason we are doing bad, the big reason there are nearly 150 thousand deaths, are because people won’t put a piece if paper on their face. Sorry if this came out as a bit to aggressive. But something needs to change. I saw a group of 50 people in a 10*10 foot area; none of them had a mask. There’s a good amount of kids in Marching Band who don’t wear mask and get close to people. There are still protests going on where I believe people aren’t wearing mask where there are sometimes hundreds of other people. So please if you read this, and you aren’t wearing a mask; I am begging you to for the sake of everyone around you, wear a mask. And if you do wear a mask, and you know people who don’t, try swaying their mind into wearing one, or go throughout social media and spread the word. Because even if it’s mandatory to wear a mask; everyone knows people won’t. Or they’ll protest against the law being made. Just please, heed my advice. As I’ve said; I know I’m only 14, but I’m genuinely worried. All I’ve seen on News stations are constant news about everything bad going on. And if I can help make one of those issues a bit better. That’s all I want.

 Social Stigma of Mask Perhaps the reason why the US government is telling healthy people not to wear mask is to avoid panic. If people see others wearing mask and find out they can’t buy it anymore, the level of panic will increase. Mass panic could prove to be much worse than the disease itself. Wearing mask does not always mean you are sick or a signal for other people to stay 10 feet away from you. On the other side of the globe, healthy people are wearing mask daily when they go out. Perhaps it’s time for the Western culture to drop the dumb stigma of wearing a mask.

Still, is spreading misinformation really the way? Why are civilians being shamed for buying mask? We have the right to protect ourselves. Why do they have to say mask is useless for healthy people? It is a dangerous statement coming out from the government. In China, anyone who does not wear a mask will be arrested. Mask does work, different types of mask means different level of protection. What if the person is asymptomatic aka he/she is a carrier but has not develop symptoms yet? Can we really trust sick people to wear mask? They don’t even know how to cover their cough/sneeze properly. They are also probably afraid of being called weird for wearing a mask.

Ask yourself, why do you wear a seatbelt? Because you never know what’s going to happen, you may be able to trust yourself but you are not the only person. There are others out there, others with lack of responsibility and care for other people.

They are saying that there is not enough mask for the front liner workers, so civilians should not be hoarding it. Well, it’s not like they had almost 2 months to prepare.. Oh wait, they did. For whatever reasons of why they were not being proactive, please don’t blame the civilians for the government’s lack of preparation.

It’s easy to point fingers at other people/country. US is by no means the worst, but yet they are far from the best.There are so many questionable things that the US government does regarding the disease. From the lack of airport closures, lack of airport security health check, faulty test kits, extremely strict rules in order to qualify for testing, patients literally turned away from testing, doctors and hospitals prohibited to do testings, etc.

A wise person once said, “If you are confused of why certain actions are being made, find the answer by following where the $ is.”

Damn right.

Argument:

[Even if there are cases next door, the answer is no, you do NOT need to get or wear any face masks—surgical masks, “N95 masks,” respirator masks, or anything else—to protect yourself against the coronavirus. Not only do you not need them, you shouldn’t wear them](

 Wear masks or cover your mouth at least. I have noticed something here.
All the countries abundant with masks are suggesting to wear masks.
Italians are starting to wear masks. If you watch recent videos, important people in Italy are wearing masks.

Doctors and nurses must wear masks to protect themselves.
For us, in America, we dont have enough masks, not even for medical professionals.

If we had more masks, the government would have suggested to wear masks!

Check our your local markets. Dont trust them saying that wearing mask doesnt do anything. It is better than nothing.

Wearing a mask is not a cultural thing.
We are just told not to wear them because we dont have enough. 

So, my suggest is just use anything that could be used as a mask.

 You don’t need permission to wear a mask! Why exactly are there so many posts about wearing masks?! Is it the societal validation? I don’t understand. It’s not illegal to wear a mask or face covering! If I was lucky enough to have one of those legit consumer surgical care masks (like you get from the drugstore/grocery store) you bet I would be wearing one! Just do it. But if you are, wear them CORRECTLY. Nothing more irritating than seeing an ignoramus not wearing them or using them appropriately!! 

PS: I HOPE that these mask manufacturers will get to the point where they can redirect some of their shipments back to the stores for consumers or Amazon gets them back in stock soon so we can all have those nice surgical quality ones. But for now I’ll settle for a bandanna and common sense! I think anything is better than nothing at this point!!

 Dear Leaders, here's how to make a mask rule so that people stop dying, from a former school principal, just sayin... Dear Trump , Pence,  and Governors, In case you actually want  businesses to open and people to stop dying, here's a "primer" on how to make a rule that people care about and follow. If you do this, maybe we can stop watching our fellow citizens melting down at Trader Joes as thousands of our loved ones die needlessly.          

Making a rule that requires everyone to adopt a new behavior, such as wearing a mask, is possible, even in a culture that perceives the rule as an infraction of "their rights". I realize that some of you just don't give a crap about how many people are getting sick. Bust just in case, here you go...  Here's the philosophy, with  school examples:        



1) The rule must be enacted as both a "top-down" and a "grassroots" rule. **School Example:** "all students  at Roosevelt High School  must carry a pass when they travel throughout the school without an adult"                 

 The principal, the head dean, whoever is that top person, must "declare" that it is now a rule. - The teachers and staff must help to enforce it, and the students will have to buy into it. Here's the good news: it will work even if 5% of the community does not comply. This is based on the PBIS (positive behavior intervention supports) model.         

In some organizations, the leader must define the rule as "mandatory" , "legal" , or " critical"  in order to get compliance. If the leader says "encouraged" , you might as well forget the rule. **School Example:**  "Students, it is highly encouraged that you do not use your phone during class instruction."   VS. "Students, it is a mandatory, school-wide rule that you do not use your phone during instruction" . People may question, what is "mandatory" ?  They typically want to hear about the penalty of not following the rule. The good news is that the "penalty" might not need be that harsh, It might just be a big inconvenience.                   **School Example:** "Since we are having trouble following the students-must-carry-a- pass rule, we will have an assembly of all students at 2:00 Friday to review why it is important".                                                      

&amp;#x200B;

2) The leader(s) must give a rationale to everyone, to the people who dislike it the most (students) and to the people who will enforce it (staff). And the rationale must be based in data. School Example: "75% of our school disruptions come from students who leave areas without supervision, here is a graph of the last 500 discipline incidents, notice that 375 of these incidents were students who were traveling within the school without a pass, unsupervised. It is in all of our best interest to have students carry a pass that has been signed by staff."      



3) The leader(s) must be perceived by the community as following the rule themselves: School Example: If the school rule is "no wearing hats inside"  then all adults would have to refrain from wearing hats. ESPECIALLY THE PRINCIPAL .                                                                                                                                               

   4) The adherence, or following of the rule, must be continually be praised and publicly reported, along with the positive results.  School Example:   " This week I checked the hallways, and 90 out of 100 students I asked were carrying a pass. Thank you to all the teachers and students who are making a difference at Roosevelt High School."  This should include all of the other "enforcers" of the rule. "I want to thank Mr. Banks, Ms. Ramirez, and Ms. Chee as our "hallway pass superstars" of the week here at Roosevelt High School."



5) There must be a sense, perceived by all, that a continued disregard of the rule will be addressed. **School Example:** the teacher who continually ignores the rule must have a conversation with the principal, which will likely include a "verbal warning".  



6) Peer Pressure:  Eventually peer pressure must take over the "top-down" pressure. People will feel a sense of order, of fairness, of improvement, because of the collective effort of enacting the new rule. When others blatantly disregard the rule, the community will react with pressure to follow the rule .

 Mask wearing needs to be all or nothing, otherwise we are wasting them I see that a lot of people are starting to wear masks, but I can’t help but feel they are wasting them, hear me out:

Masks (non n95 as I see most people are wearing) are very effective for not spreading if you are a carrier (asymptomatic included) but they do not prevent you from getting exposed if someone infected coughs on/near you.

If everyone wears masks then we can stop the spread, but as most people cannot buy any due to supply issue this isn’t possible.

So now we have this situation where people wearing masks are still getting exposed to the virus due to infected people not having masks. 

At this point would it be more effective for people that currently have masks to hold off wearing it until the production catches up? Otherwise we will be stuck in this cycle where masks are getting disposed while productions are trying to catch up. 

At that point everyone can wear masks and we stop the spread way more effectively.

Obviously this is never going to happen but with the amount of people not wearing masks, your best bet is not going outside as your mask won’t save you at all.

 How long can I wear the standard 3-ply surgical mask? I’ve heard that it last about 1.5-2 hours in active working environment due to sweat/moisture/environmental factors. Any offical recommendation on how often to change out a new mask? How long can I wear the standard 3-ply surgical mask?
