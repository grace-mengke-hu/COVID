 Is Etsy Safe to order cotton masks? Not sure if its safe to order cotton masks on Etsy. I was trying amazon, but most of the sellers are based in China. 

I dont want to waste money, but I need some cotton masks. 

Where does everyone buy theirs?

 Let's say I buy a bag of chips, I wash my hands, open the bag of chips and start eating... At any point after me opening the bag of chips, could I have gotten the virus from it being on the bag? Should I sanitize my hands *after* opening the bag as well? Even if I just washed them? or is that overkill?

Does soap/sanitizer keep killing bacteria, viruses for a good while after applying?

 PSA: Please don't handle money I just witnessed a great example of mass public ignorance.

At a store, people (customers and employee are using all sorts of protection. Gloves, hand sanitizer, sticks to press buttons. Everything is somewhat isolated. Until you reach checkout. All the same people who are trying not to get infected hand money from their own wallet to the clerk. Clerk gives change they put in their own wallet. When handling money they are doing nothing to protect.... Money is gross on a normal day.... It carries mass amounts of germs. 

When you put it back into your wallet, you take everything it has with you, spreading it to your other bills. Then you give it to a cashier, they get it on their hands, put it in the drawer, it spreads stuff to other money. Now that cashier is handing out all sorts of infection causing germs to future customers.

Use contactless pay as much as possible please everyone. 

Here is the supporting research from a few years ago.

 Wash your hands - but also apply lotion regularly! We're all washing our hands a lot now, which is great. But in doing so, they'll dry out more easily (especially given we're still in the cold months), which could create cracks in your skin.

After every 2nd or 3rd time washing my hands, I've been doing a liberal dose of Jergens (on my hands). 

Perhaps Wash your hands bot should include this disclaimer, just a thought. 

That's all.

 Reusing Face Masks? So obviously because of the virus we’ve all had to get pretty used to wearing face masks when we leave the house. Should we theoretically be washing/disposing of face masks after EVERY use, and if so why? 

I don’t touch my eyes nose or mouth when I put on or take off my mask, and especially make sure to not touch the inside of the mask no matter what. When I’m done with the mask I make sure the outside does not touch any other objects, and always wash my hands right after just to be safe. 

Not sure how the science works but thoughts would be great! Thanks.

 Why is Face washing not talked about I am stymied as to why washing your face is not mentioned in every statement about washing your hands. You do not get the Coronavirus from your hands. You get it from your face that is mouth,eyes,nose and ears. Washing your hands without washing your face does nothing. 

PLEASE pass this along.

 Is there a point in continuing to pretend that covid will be contained in the USA? All this about wearing a mask and changing our lives - well if covid is going to infect everyone in the USA anyway then why am I supposed to bother trying to avoid it? The cat is out of the bag right?
