 (I am confused dot com) AMERICAN FREEEEEDOM VS my freedom So, the freest goverment in this unfree world has been telling the freest people of the freest nation in this unfree world, 

"Americans, you are free to go out to work. Liberate! Free yourself, Americans."

Okay, I am starting to wonder. Free from what? Fear? Or from Covid-19? Or CNN and frakking democrats? Or Dr. Fauci? 

Then, my confusion continues...Free to do what? Free only to work? Yes, freedom to work and get my hair done? Now, I am definitely confused. 

So, now, the free goverment is feeling so free to tell free people to get freed to be free for free. It doesn't take a penny telling someone, "You are free to go to work! You are a free man to work in a mall and have freedom to circumcize your free external thing"

What if a free American asks the free goverment for some basic protections to avoid getting mugged by this virus which seems freer than average free Amreicans, now? Is it included in or connected to the freedom in America? Or is it just a matter of equality? It seems like people don't have much space to talk about that ideal, now. 

I am not American. But, I studied Art in America for 3 years. I believe I tasted the American freedom - daring to dream, smelling opportunities in oneself and the environment, trying to catch every particular in the air, working hard, etc. 

But, I am in UK, now. I have been wondering about the true nature of the freedom in an American sense.
