 As a hospital waiter, I was told I am not allowed to wear a mask at work. I work as a waiter in a hospital in California. I brought my own masks to work, and my manager told me to take it off and I can’t wear it on the floors where the patients are. I touch all the patients’ dirty food trays and take their food order in person.

He asks me how many people my age (19) have gotten sick of the coronavirus to try and convince me I’m not really at risk. I specifically tell him I am concerned about my health still and others I live with, and just want to be extra cautious. He said he can call someone up to explain why I can’t wear the mask, but told me they may be dealing with more pressing matters.  

He also told me it gives off the “wrong message.” But the message seems clear: the universities and schools in our area are closed along with events larger that 250+ people, just a week ago Italy was running as usual and is now locked down, and compared to other countries our testings don’t seem to be on par with, let alone better, than countries with smaller populations. Yet, people in the hospital are looking at me like I’m crazy.

I ignored his order and kept the mask on.

A few minutes later he spots me and asks if I heard anything he said. I tell him he is either going to have to send me home or write me up, because I will not work without the mask. He said he’d call the people and get back to me. I’m still to hear from him. But I feel no matter the reason, I will want to continue wearing my mask.

Even if it doesn’t protect me anymore than not wearing the mask, it gives me piece of mind. I read the flyer they passed out saying how to properly use the masks and have been following their direction.

The only reason I’d think they don’t want the food service workers using masks is to conserve it for people more at-risk. I understand that and haven’t been using the ones from work. I brought them from home. 

On top of that, they are telling other workers they HAVE TO wear a mask if the didn’t get the flu shot. I got the flu shot, but I want to wear the mask still. I would expect they’d be more concerned about the people who didn’t get the flu shot and refuse to wear a mask.

Am I out of line?

 We are never getting out of shelter at home as long as selfish imbeciles like these can’t follow the guidelines. Their behavior could literally cost someone their life. Is there any way to fix this???

 St. Patrick’s Day Parades I was just thinking, I wonder if St. Pats parades and festivals will be cancelled. There’s the crowds of course, but also a lot of drinking and the whole “kiss me I’m Irish” thing and girls running through the parade kissing people (at least at the one in Savannah which was or is the 2nd largest in the US when I lived there iirc). 

You’ve got all those people from multiple cities and small towns coming to have fun. A lot of people from Atlanta go to Savannah’s parade and Atlanta has the world’s largest international airport. People from all over the northeast go to the one in NYC, which is currently experiencing an outbreak. Plus, there’s groups of people who come from across the country to perform in the parades (and whose connecting flights are often ATL).

Then there’s the actual spread between these people. There’s saliva on people through kissing. There’s beer cups and cans thrown everywhere that people have to pick up. There’s 300,000 people drinking and sharing bathrooms in a city that is only half that size in its entirety. There’s drunk people and people throwing up. On top of just a lot of people being in close proximity.

It seems like there’s a decent potential to spread the virus at these events. But at the same time I know there’s no way in hell that they will suspend them - Savannah’s economy is largely dependent on tourism and this is a huge stimulus to the area. I’m almost positive Atlanta is underreporting cases currently due to the airport and their own tourism industry. The governor would not be re-elected if he screwed up and let GA’s tourism get hurt by the virus. 

But everything I’ve read so far says these events won’t be cancelled unless there’s a local outbreak (no clue what NYC’s excuse is). Do you think that something in the next 9 days will change that? And what do you think will happen if the events go on as planned?

 How can I help others understand that they need to take this seriously .... I write to ask what are your reasonings for not taking COVID as serious as others ? This includes social distancing - wearing masks- gloves - all and any other protocols given to protect the health of you - me and others. I’m asking not as sarcasm but to try to gain a better understanding from others. I’m hoping feedback will help me understand better and also to try to get others to understand me better. My boyfriend who I’m staying with during this becomes defensive any time I remind him to do this and it always turns into a fight.. becoming so detached and frustrated. It’s starting to seem he doesn’t care about me or my safety due to his actions and behaviors

 What’s the probability of an older person with underlying problems being asymptomatic or only mild problems? My grandmother is 65 with COPD. I’m terrified at the thought of her getting this and dying. Is it pretty much guaranteed that if she gets it with her age and health problems that it’ll do a number on her or is it possible for her to have it and not even know it like some people?

 Can someone link me to statistics about otherwise healthy individuals catching this virus? My brother in law says a healthy diet is all you need to not end up in the ICU.

 We are beyond fucked. Grocery stores like Black Friday. Traffic bad. Not a mask to be found. Went for an early grocery store run. Eastern PA. 150 people at each entrance lined up right. Not a single mask. 

Traffic today was like normal rush hour. 

We need a forced lock down like now. People are fucking morons. We also need a better way to handle supply runs. Hundreds packed together for a half hour is just a disaster waiting to happen.

 What do you say to some that says this to you? So being concerned about the 99%+ who WONT die from coronavirus is selfish and uncaring? Being concerned about families who have no source of income because of the lockdown is being reckless and self-serving? Tell me again how righteous you are?

This is coming from a "its just the flu bro" evangelical nutter.

 Do you believe this is worse than what they’re telling us? I know they’re trying to reduce panic, but is this worse than what we know?

 Any predictions if America did a mass quarantine such as Italy. Italy did what seems to be a surprise mass quarantine. With 16 million people on lock down, but are there any predictions what would happen if America did something similar? Right now Italy has people fleeing, riots, panic and etc. I'd assume although I'd like to see a proper risk assessment.
