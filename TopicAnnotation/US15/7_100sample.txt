 FFCRA and expanded FMLA - how will it work for reduced hours? My husband's hours (and therefore pay) was reduced to 60%

His employer informed that he qualifies for the sick leave and expanded FMLA benefits since his kids are home from school.

I know that the benefits are "2 weeks full paid sick leave, then 10 weeks at 2/3 pay"... how will this work for reduced hours? Will he have 80 hours of sick leave and then 10 weeks at 2/3 pay? Or will he have 2 weeks where they pay the full loss of earnings (so his 60% pay PLUS 40% sick leave pay), and then 10 weeks where he gets his 60% pay plus 2/3 his loss of earnings?

 IDEA: Recent NYTimes article mentioned Germany is using "block testing" or "batch testing" to conserve tests. Is anyone doing that in USA? For screening/detection purposes, it's reported* that Germany is using batch testing or block testing.

That is, they take 10 swab samples and test them together.  A negative test means all 10 samples are negative. If it's positive, you know at least one is positive, but not which one.

&gt; Medical staff, at particular risk of contracting and spreading the virus, are regularly tested. To streamline the procedure, some hospitals have started doing block tests, using the swabs of 10 employees, and following up with individual tests only if there is a positive result.

Is there any case of this being done in the USA?

 Coworker tested positive and didn’t say anything... what do I do? Three weeks ago, I work at a bar and worked with this coworker 5 days before she tested positive. She tested positive and didn’t say anything to anyone until now. 

I got sick with what I assumed was a flu. No specific Coronavirus symptoms. I have been self isolating to the extreme. My boyfriend who also works with us. Got sick. Another coworker got Pneumonia. 

I’m angry that she didn’t say anything. I spent two weeks totally alone and now am with my family who is extremely Vulnerable to this virus. 

What can be done about this? Should I get tested now??

 From a healthcare worker in Long Island who is back at work after having COVID- what are your symptoms? For those inquiring about the sequence of symptoms:

Symptoms started on Feb 15th. Very sore throat for 4-5 days and aches with mild fever. I was able to work during this time (and spread it to others). It then developed into severe dyspnea with cough and ear pain (otitis media with effusion). I went to urgent care on Feb 19th and was prescribed a steroid, inhaler, Flonase and Claritin. I tested negative for the flu. I was told that I had an “unknown upper respiratory infection.” 
Fast-forward to today; lingering dry cough and mild lethargy. Since I am past the 14 day incubation I am back at work, but three people within my department have now tested positive with the EXACT same sequence of symptoms. My husband also had it. He has a notoriously badass immune system... he presented with headaches and mild cough with nocturnal dyspnea. 
Anyone else in NYC area experienced the same or similar symptoms before/after testing positive?

 Coworker had flulike symptoms since last Wednesday and can’t get tested for Coronavirus My coworker has had Flulike symptoms since last Wednesday. Last Wednesday he went to the doc was told he had the flu and was given meds to treat the flu. As of Sunday he finished his meds and has gone downhill since with flu symptoms again. He went to the doc again today and was told they believe it was nothing more than the flu. Maybe they are right, but he asked about getting tested for Coronavirus and they told him you have to be admitted into the hospital to be given the test. The tests aren’t available to anyone who wants them who is exhibiting symptoms. Not only is the media hyping the whole outbreak up, but the government is also lying about tests being available.

 Just got tested and they didn’t ask me to verify my name Hello, my dad and I just got tested for covid (we both live in the same house) and the nurses who did our swab didn’t ask us to verify our names, just our addresses. We live in TX. I don’t know why I didn’t ask them to verify our names because I just thought that if we live in the same household, then if my dad tested positive, I will also test positive. I’m thinking about it and what if only one of us is positive, how do we know who tested positive if they confirm our names? 

Also the nasal swab didn’t hurt. They only did one nostril. It just felt uncomfortable, tickled and made me sneeze. Anyone else had this experience as well? I heard that it was supposed to make you tear up and make your nostril burn.

 No COVID-19 cases haven't slowed down in the US. Testing has. TL:DR. The spread of COVID-19 is not yet slowing down. The United States hit a ceiling of 100,000 total tests a day a week ago and new positive cases are not reflecting the actual spread of the virus. The percentage of tests that have come back positive has doubled since mid-March indicating testing facilities are prioritizing the obviously sick for testing.


From March 1st until about March 23rd, the rate of reported positive cases in the US increased by about 30%-33% every day then began to slow steadily and is now at around 14% increase in daily reported positive cases.

Why is this not good news? Until that point testing increased daily as well, by around 35% daily, until it slowed, on the 23rd. In fact daily testing has hit a ceiling for now and for the last week the United States has only been stuck at doing only 100,000 tests a day. 

This in and of itself wouldn't be troubling. If the spread is in fact slowing down then we would expect to see a reduction in the number of tests needed to keep up with new cases, but we would also expect to see the percentage of positive tests vs total tests to stay roughly the same or decline overtime. If testing facilities are running out of tests and prioritizing testing people who are definitely sick and obviously symptomatic we would expect to see an increase in the percentage of positive tests vs total tests.

~10% of daily tests were positive mid March. That rate steadily increased and roughly 20% of daily tests in the US are positive. 

We would also expect to see many more deaths as hospitals become increasingly overburdened. In the US it has been reported that three times as many people have died just in the last week of COVID-19 than have died in all the previous weeks combined.

 Neighbor has COVID, but is continuing to travel and refuses to get tested because “it’ll ruin her image”, what can I do? Long story short she’s gotten our other neighbors sick (they house sat for her, contracted COVID from her apartment) and they confronted her about it asking her to get tested and she refused. She said it would ruin her image and has continued to travel between LA and various places in NorCal. Is there anyone to report her in terms of contact tracing to anyone? It’s gotten so bad the house sitters had to reach out to her family / ex-husband to tell them that she will lie about having COVID. 

Normally I’m not a snitch, but this is just blatant disregard for other people’s lives.

 Testing guidelines? I have a family friend, the father who is a emergency responder, has been tested positive. Fortunately he is doing well, and instructed to quarantine for 14 days at home. But the healthcare personnel didn’t not request other household members, wife and 2 children, to get test. Testing guidelines?

I would imagine the family member should be tested immediately as well, but the healthcare staff stated that unless they are showing symptoms, they do not need to be tested. Also, the 14 day quarantine was advised for the father only, the other household members were not advised to self-quarantine. I am very surprised by the guideline which seem very relaxed. Can anyone share some thought or the reasoning?

 Oregon - teen died of "flu" You can take this with a grain of salt if you wish. 

My daughter's boyfriend just texted her, one of his friends has been sick for a couple weeks with the "flu." He went into ICU last night and just passed away this morning - seventeen.

His lungs had filled with fluid. He apparently tested positive for the flu. I doubt he was tested for anything else. Could it really have been just the flu? Yes I suppose. Strange timing and if they don't test I guess we'll never know.

Good luck all.

 How do you know who tested positive or negative if no one asks or checks? Last month my workplace had two people test positive for covid. Everyone had to get tested including myself. Thankfully I came back negative and I returned to work based upon what HR mandated...

But no one asked for my test results. And I mean NO ONE. When I got my results I called my boss to let him know. I asked him how I should send my results to him via email or text and he said he didn't need them. So I just went back to work like I said along with everyone else except the two who tested positive. They sat out awhile longer. I never received any verification of how my fellow coworkers tested. In fact, no one said anything. When I brought it up to another supervisor in store they simply said that in order to come back to work the employees needed to test negative. 

Fast forward to the past week. Another positive case and we all have to get tested again. I got a call from HR letting me know the same routine and earliest I can return to work etc. But my main concern is this. Think about it. What if a worker got tested, it came back positive, but they were asymptomatic and felt fine? What if they just thought "I feel and look fine. I don't feel sick at all. I will just go back when HR says so." And don't rule out selfishness here. So I ask a question that I pretty much know the answer to: do I have the right to ask for proof of everyone's test results? (I assume not because of pRiVaCy). I don't want to go back to work and one of my coworkers tested positive and puts me and others at risk. What are your thoughts?

 It helps to be "someone" if you want a COVID19 test So the number of tests are limited and we are now being told that even if you develop symptoms you should not immediately get tested but rather isolate. We are supposed to be conserving tests and therefore the PPE thats being used when testing. The way I'm seeing things, people of higher "status" are being tested despite this. Ie: actors, althetes, politicians. Just saw Rand Paul has just now tested positive. Ok thats fine, but they also said he was just at the senate gym this morning. If he was well enough to go to the gym I'm assuming he had no symptoms, so why was he tested? Mike Pence and his wife were tested, despite no symptoms, because a whitehouse staffer tested positive. The thing is they admittedly had no contact with that staffer at all. I could go on with examples, but it just seems another example of how this whole situation is being botched.  Thoughts?

 The hidden fees of the testing process Just personally experienced the Covid-19 testing process in Michigan USA, and it wasn't a great experience. 

I am showing symptoms of being sick (cold like symptoms; congestion and fever) and was encouraged to get tested by others. I heard Beaumont in Dearborn, MI had drive through Coronavirus testing so my brother and I drove over there. We arrived just after 3pm and I did not get tested until 7pm. A four hour wait. Even though we live together and he was in the car with me the entire time, he was not allowed to get tested. I was told that my symptoms technically weren't enough to get tested (99.7 degree fever isn't a fever, 100+ is, and the only positive cases they've had there were both struggling to breathe) but they were still *willing* to test me. They informed me that I would be tested for the flu and then, if that comes back negative, Covid-19. I had a flu vaccine four months ago but that didn't matter. The process seemed reasonable enough to me. (We'll come back to this later) 

After getting tested we waited another hour for discharge. On the surface this seems like a pretty standard hospital wait time. But then the kicker came... 

Just prior to discharge I was told I will be charged $250 for this process. I was confused because I've been hearing all about how testing is being made free to all Americans with symptoms. It was explained to me that the Emergency Room visit and Flu test are not the Covid-19 test so I owe money for those services. I was asked to consent to proceed with testing (after being there 5 hours) and if I didn't then I wouldn't be charged but my test would not be submitted, aka I wasted most of my day. They said someone would call me later to discuss insurance options and options for lowering the cost of this whole process. I consented, as fortunately I can afford the $250, but not everyone can and pressure like that puts people in a tough decision making spot. 

After I left, I received the call from the financial support department to discuss payment options. I didn't qualify for their financial assistance program (I didn't expect to) but she was able to waive 76% of the fees just for speaking with her. I explained that I was told it will be $250 and asked if that means 76% off of the $250 or if the $250 quote included the discount. She then explained that **$250 was NOT the full cost of my entire visit, that was just the cost of the ER Room fee.** The $250 will be *part of* my bill, but not the entire bill, and then the entire bill will get 76% off. She did explain that the government has been talking about waiving the entire visit cost, which I thought was the case when you hear "Coronavirus testing is free" but that hasn't happened yet. She definitely was apologetic and wants to get it discounted as much as possible for me which I appreciate and don't blame the hospital for, but the cost was there nonetheless. 

SO BE WARNED if you do not have health insurance and cannot afford a minimum of $250 for testing you will not be eligible for the Covid-19 test EVEN IF YOU’RE SHOWING SYMPTOMS. They will just discard your test. After a 5 hour wait if you can’t afford it — bye bye. 

This is a worrisome situation to say the least.

 If only the sickest people are being tested, that too after they test negative for Flu and a myriad of other stuff. If we are actually doing that, why is the positive % around 10%? What do the other people have? Aren't the remaining susceptible to getting the virus in the future? Please excuse my very limited knowledge of epidemics or infectious diseases in general. I am looking for some scientific answers to my questions below - 

1) If we have so many hoops for testing and most of these people who get tested for covid have already been tested negative for the Flu and other stuff, why is the positive % so less? What exactly do these people have?

2) Let's assume they have just the common cold, doesn't this mean that they can get coronavirus in the future? So even if we test 100% of the population once (and have a 10% positive rate) the remaining 90% have the chances of getting it if the 10% are not strictly quarantined?

These might seem like noob questions, but I just need to understand what exactly is happening?

I work at a small vet clinic. We have had one coworker text us saying they had all the classic symptoms. Got tested yesterday but we wont know the results 3-5 days from now. They were told by the people who tested her to self iosolate for 7 days. Two others called out sick with fever. We are going to be short staffed for awhile. And im just waiting to get sick myself. Im just wondering what my boss will do once a good chunk of us is out. Or if my coworker does test positive. I wish I had proper sick time off or I would've quarantined myself.

 Tested positive for antibodies today. My only symptom was loss of smell. I KNEW I had it. I live in Los Angeles and was refused a test by my doctor last month via video appointment. He told me loss of smell wasn’t a symptom and I was refused a test. I told him I had 5 roommates and thought it was important I knew if I was a carrier but nope. Anyways, I couldn’t smell ANYTHING for over a week. It was so weird. Not even Apple cider vinegar right from the bottle!

My sister in another state also tested positive but she actually had flu symptoms along with loss of smell. Her bf just had a headache and Loss of smell. I’m not sure where/when I got it but I’m happy I have the antibodies now. My doctor said he knew I’d test positive as soon as I mentioned the smell thing.

 Some COVID-19 Testing Facilities Might Be Operating Inefficiently Hopefully this is an appropriate sub, as r/Coronavirus doesn't seem to allow self posts.
&amp;nbsp;

tl;dr: Covid-19 testing might be able to be optimized in some laboratories to allow for higher throughput and lower turnaround time.

&amp;nbsp;

A few days ago I saw some articles about how some Covid-19 testing laboratories were starting to pool samples to save time/reagents/tests. One laboratory supposedly was pooling 64 samples together, and if the composite sample tested positive, they would test all 64 samples individually. To me, this seems better than testing all samples individually to begin with, but not quite optimized.

&amp;nbsp;

You can adjust two variables. First, you can adjust how large of a composite sample you initially take. Secondly, if a composite sample tests positive, you don't need to test all samples in the batch individually. You can split the samples into sublots.

&amp;nbsp;

I wrote a script in Python to simulate the testing using pooling. I found a method that is simple and seems very efficient (But could potentially be further optimized). The proposed pooling method is as follows:
&amp;nbsp;

-Determine the initial pooling size. You want to pool a number of samples such that there is a 50% chance of a positive sample being in the pooled batch. This can be determined using the formula N = -0.693/ln(1-p), where "N" is the number of samples to initially pool and "p" is the probability of a sample being positive. [Chart/Graph]( for clarity.
&amp;nbsp;

-If a pooled sample returns as positive, divide the pool into three equal sublots (If the number of samples is not divisible by 3, simply add one more or one fewer sample to one of the sublots). Test each sublot individually.
&amp;nbsp;

-If a sublot returns as positive, divide the sublot into three smaller sublots. Continue this pattern until all positive samples have been identified.

&amp;nbsp;

The efficiency of this pooling method is dependent on the probability that any given sample tests positive for Covid-19. Here is a [chart]( showing this data. As you can see, when less than 10% of samples are positive, the method is very efficient (You need 38.6% as many tests as individual sampling when 5.0% of samples are positive and 59.1% as many tests as individual sampling when 10.0% of samples are positive). When 29.3% of samples are assumed to be positive, there is no difference in the number of tests required whether you use pooling or individual sampling. So in a place like the Philippines or New Jersey (Where 60% and 37% of recent tests have been positive for Covid-19 respectively), individual testing is necessary.

&amp;nbsp;

I am unfamiliar with the biological assays used for Covid-19 testing. I imagine that pooling samples is a logistical challenge to an extent. I am also unsure about the largest pooling size allowed before sensitivity of the assay becomes a problem. Perhaps somebody in this field could shed some light on the feasibility of implementing such a pooling strategy in testing facilities. Are labs that have &lt;15-20% positive rates typically pooling samples or are just a few facilities? If labs are pooling samples, have they optimized their strategies, or could this information be useful?

&amp;nbsp;

Additionally, perhaps somebody with more statistics/programming knowledge could further optimize a pooling strategy/verify data. If anybody would like to see the Python script, please DM me and I will gladly share (Note that I am a beginner with Python and probably don't have the cleanest or most elegant code).

 Friends husband has pneumonia and tested positive for Covid but her and her kids won’t get tested. Granted it’s been 10 days since he got sick.  Finally went to the Dr and tested positive a week after symptoms.  But my friend doesn’t think it’s a big deal.  They had people at their house when he was sick (but hadn’t tested yet). Shouldn’t they be getting tested and let people know?

 Here’s why coronavirus is not “just like the flu” *opinion piece from angry citizen long read ahead* 

The symptoms may be similar and you may get over it just as you would a flu. However, COVID-19 is not just like the flu.

The flu has ample testing. You can go to the doctors and be tested and within 15 minutes have your results. 

The flu has vaccines. And while some years they may miss the mark on the vaccine it still helps significantly. 

If tested quickly the flu can be helped with prescription antiviral medications (if taken within 48 hours of coming down with it). 

Yes, thousands of people die from the flu each year. But MILLIONS also get the flu each year. And we know that because we have easy TESTING. What these numbers mean:

We keep hearing “20,000-50,000 people die from the flu each year are you this panicked about the flu????” Yeah well an estimated 34,000,000-49,000,000 contract the flu a year. So when you run those numbers that is not even a 1% death rate. So no, I am not this panicked about the flu. In fact if you use the most deaths in that range against the least amount of cases in that rage you only get a 0.15% death rate. Yes people. Not even 1%. 

It isn’t helpful to compare a novel virus against the flu, something we have been dealing with for ages. In the end, coronavirus might end up being just like the flu when you compare the numbers. But right *now* we just don’t know. What IS helpful is pushing to provide ample testing so we can truly know the numbers, so we can QUARANTINE AND CONTAIN, so we can PREVENT future spread. we need to be researching possible medications and treatments and funding researching for vaccines for future cases. Only THEN can we compare COVID against something we deal with every winter season. 

The powers that be need to push for better efforts in dealing with this so that it does not become “just like the flu” after all, do we really WANT 40,000,000 Americans coming down with coronavirus? because *that* is “just like the flu”.

Call your senators, threaten their reelection campaigns unless they push for bills that add more funding, add more testing, add more prevention efforts, more quarantines, more research. More everything. Take care of yourselves, make sacrifices so you can self isolate, give up that birthday party, fun trip, wash your hands and then wash them again, do anything you can so that actually this doesn’t become just like the flu.

 I think my Dr. lied about testing be for COVID-19 Does anyone know if the same sample from a flu test can also be used for the COVID-19 test? For the flu test, I was swabbed just inside my nose but I heard that the COVID test is much more painful. Anyone have any insight? When I called up to my city’s health department, they told me they had no record of any test  of mine being sent to them but to continue to wait. About 2 weeks later I get a call from the hospital that tested me that my test was negative when u was told the health department would call me.

I feel as though I have been lied to and everyone is calling me paranoid.

 Question about my situation... On Sunday my girlfriend got notified that one of her roomates that she went to the beach with tested positive for COVID. She was notified after I’ve kissed her so I decide to quarantine with her (lol). Later that day she gets tested and she tests positive, and I get tested as well and it turns out to be negative(both rapid &amp; 3-5 test). Originally I thought that I had a false negative because of how early i decided to test myself. Fast forward a couple days of me and her quarantining together and I decide to get tested again to see if I’m still negative, and I am. 

I’m now either confused with the testing accuracy or with how Coronavirus spreads because throughout that week I kissed her multiple times and I apparently didn’t contract anything. Does anyone know why?
