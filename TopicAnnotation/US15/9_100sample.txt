 How do we know how long Coronavirus has been in US? By most  accounts, the coronavirus presents like the flu or even a cold. Isn’t it possible that it has been in the US for a while and just never diagnosed?  Instead, like with the flu or a cold, most people got better (so no reason for testing or further testing). And if someone got worse, that patient could just as likely been thought by doctors to have complications from the flu, pneumonia, or something else?

 The Beginning Of The End? The Coronavirus pandemic has already claimed numerous lives and severely disrupted everyday life in America.

If Coronavirus got totally out of control, what's the absolute worst that could happen to the United States?

 100% loss of smell. Doctor says not to worry.. but this is so unnerving! I’m in Los Angeles and have been practicing social distancing etc. a few days ago I started experiencing severe allergy symptoms like itchy, runny eyes and nose, sneezing, coughing etc. I have never been diagnosed with allergies but after seeing there was a high level of pollen and allergens I decide to try Allegra to see if that would help. I don’t want to be one of those paranoid people distracting the doctors thinking I have COVID-19. Well this morning I lost my sense of smell 100%. My nose is not stuffed up. I thought I was imagining it but I sprayed perfume on my wrist - I smell NOTHING. I lit a very potent candle - NOTHING. I took Allegra, steamed my face, tried sniffing apple cider vinegar - I smell 0%. This has never happened before in my life. I got a video appointment with a doctor and he thinks it’s sinus build up and I should use a neti pot. Of course I don’t want COVID and I ordered the neti pot but this has never happened to me before and I know it’s a symptom of COVID-19 so I’m kind of worried... should I be?

 Getting smell back after months??? My husband lost his smell in March when he had Coronavirus.  Hes starting to get it back,  but he said the good smells are tolerable, the bad smells are so bad he can't take it. He also said all the bad smells are the same smell.  

Has this happened to anyone and how long until it straitened out?

 COVID-19 Will someone please answer these questions: 1. What % of persons exposed to COVID-19 contract (not a doctor so this may be an incorrect word choice) C-19?

2. What % of people who contract or have C-19 will become sick?

We know early estimates say between .6% and 3% of people who have C-19 will die. I’d like some more and specific clarity on these other two (above) questions.

Thank you very much in advance for your help and I hope you are all well.

 My take on NY for now. Hey, so this is not scientific at all, but I work HR for a company with about a thousand people on staff. We do events in the city, large events. So all our staff is at risk considering high exposure to large groups is part of their job, if there was any hidden cluster in NYC, we'd get a lot more people calling in sick. We haven't. So I got this reassuring me in those stressful times.

 "One of the last conversations I had with him, he said 'This is real buddy, I thought it wasn't real. I thought it was a joke. I thought I'd get to be back at work in two weeks,'" Torres recalls. "He goes, 'I can't believe it.'"

 We need a flag for front line medical people As a Northern California resident I am very familiar with the American flag with the red stripe saluting fire personnel (the 2017 Tubbs fire was stopped just four blocks from my house) and the American flag with the blue stripe for law enforcement. I think we need to honor our front line medical Doctors and Nurses with a flag as well. How about one with a yellow stripe.

 My coworker who doesn’t believe in the coronavirus is coughing on me without covering her mouth because she thinks it’s “funny” This happened 5 times today. I told my boss that he needs to tell her to stop, and he said I obviously don’t think it’s as funny as himself and my coworker think it is. No, I don’t think it’s funny to be coughed on by a grown ass woman. What do I do if even my boss won’t help me?

 Did I have Covid-19 early December in Michigan? Nobody believes me but I believe I had the coronavirus Mid December in Michigan. It started with a sore throat one night at work. Pretty much leading into a really bad cold starting the next morning. I worked at a place called Zingermans Mail Order in Ann Arbor, MI overnights. My position had a lot of dust in the work area so I would wear a N95 mask to cover my lungs and protect from dust mites. One particular night my throat began to hurt I figured it was dry and I was thirsty. Kept drinking water never got better got worst by the end of my shift. Following the next morning I called off for my shift. I figured the dust made me sick after searching symptoms. Within the next 3-4 days my cold was horrible and my throat was super sore, I had lost my voice and sounded terrible, I had a very bad cough that literally wouldn’t stop. I play basketball and workout everyday but I would run out of breath from simply talking or walking or running very short distances. My body was aching and sore. During the night when I slept, I would begin sweating and take a cover off and then within 10-15 minutes I would shiver and be cold and go back to wrapping myself up. I was sweating so bad my sheets would be soaked and my chest was slippery. I went to the doctor they told me I had a virus from basically a normal cold and a fever but I did not have the flu. I was given medicine but after continuously taking it I barely got better. At my appointment I was told if I didn’t feel better in 3-5 days return to the doctor. Finally one day I started feeling better and went back to work the following day. The same night by the end of the shift I was back in the same position except worst. My cough was non stop, my fever was back, my body ached, my nose ran non stop with sneezing, I still didn’t have my voice back. I could barely finish one sentence and I was out of breathe. I told my girlfriend I believe the dust mites scarred my lungs, because I can’t breathe the same. I went to an urgent care (Different doctor)after a few days and informed them I went to the doctor previously and the symptoms have persisted for atleast a week and a half. I was wheezing, coughing, and had shortness of breath. I was treated with a Nebulizer which is an breathing treatment that expands the lungs and I used it for about 15 minutes. Directly after I felt great but later on my symptoms persisted for about 3-4 more days. Finally I got well and it was the sickest I ever had gotten. Due to me believing it was dust mites I quit my job at Zingermans. I have a girlfriend named Isley who can vouch for me and my experience, although she doesn’t believe it was possible I had Covid-19 because she thinks she would’ve gotten infected and sick. I might even have text messages from my co workers still explaining that I was sick! I promise I couldn’t make this up. Do you think this is possible? Share and respond to my story!

 My school is telling me i was in contact with someone who had coronavirus but they wont tell me who Maybe im missing something here im fully open to changing my opinion, but my school (high school) wont tell me who i came into contact with. They are going to "call me when they find out if i was in contact for extended periods of time"

Like, wouldnt i know that a lot more about who i was near than a teacher who has 15 people in their class?

Im still fairly active in the community and i go to a small gym and stuff so i dont wanna be giving everyone and their dog coronavirus.

If i got coronavirus id be postin it and telling everyone im struggling to see the reason they wouldnt tell me.

Id appriciate some insight as this kind of perplexes me.

 Fauci's comments this evening are confusing to me. Title, but to elaborate: Fauci just said that 'we're seeing some light at the end of the tunnel.'  I completely understand how mitigation and social distancing works, and I understand that deaths are the tail end (after a spike).

With that said, is he only speaking about NY/NJ?  My state (NC) has ever increasing cases and we still don't have enough testing.  Why won't cases spike if our state of emergency is lifted at the end of April?  How about the states who haven't required non-essential businesses to close?  Won't there be a spike in those locations?

Bottom line: I'm not suggesting we live in isolation until there's a vaccine, but I just can't believe that come May 1, the worst of this is over and life returns to normal.  What am I missing?

 The mass hysteria and panic has to stop. Every single day of my life, I've run the risk of contracting illnesses. And I have, over and over again. Yet somehow, I survived every incident.

Now, because the cowards at every level of government have induced mass fear, society has all be entirely shut down. The fear has snowballed into mass panic over an illness that is not serious enough to warrant the attention it has gotten.

The World Health Organization describes illness caused by Covid-19 as, and I quote: "generally mild".

Why are so many people afraid? Why are these morons walking around in public with face masks and gloves on? Why are these idiots panic buying supplies? Have we become so soft as a society that we allow even the smallest of hardships to completely break us? These people don't act like this during flu season. People seem way more afraid to catch Covid-19 than HIV for Christ's sake.

I will likely catch this virus eventually, no matter what precautions I take. And I will survive. I suggest that others think for themselves and stop giving in to the mass cowardice. Yes, getting sick sucks. If you are at risk, then you take the precautions that YOU need to survive. The remaining 99% of the population that catch the virus will recover, and it should be business as usual for us.

 Please tell me why U.S media tell people that "Masks don't work" &amp; "Don't wear masks"??? Coronavirus, like many many other viruses is aerosol. It can stay in the air and be inhaled. It can also move with the wind and come to you and then be inhaled. It's really not rocket science to understand that wearing a mask SIGNIFICANTLY reduces chances of you inhaling this viral particle as it flies through the air. --&gt; THESE, are universally known facts. i.e. You don't have to be a doctor or Coronavirus scientist to know this. 

If your mask is a normal surgical mask, you get a decent protection compared to wearing nothing. If your mask is N95, you get SIGNIFICANTLY higher protection against the virus since N95 filter 95% of particulates. N99 masks are even more protective than N95s. --&gt; THESE, are universally known facts. i.e. You don't have to be a rocket scientist or Coronavirus knower to know this. 

What I don't understand is this --&gt; Why, on earth, U.S Media, and I mean EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM from CNN to FOX and all those in between, constantly and continously day &amp; night been promoting to the poor American people that "MASKS DONT WORK", "DONT WEAR MASK", I've even seen headlines such as "WEARING MASKS INCREASE YOUR CHANCE OF GETTING VIRUS". Can anyone tell me why on earth U.S &amp; its media is promoting these nonsense? Shouldn't those who distribute this nonsense be criminally prosecuted for the grieve damage they cause to many lives telling people to go unprotected when faced with an aerosol breathable virus?

 My wife is a paramedic. Her and other first responders like her, need your help Hello Redditors. I am writing to ask a favor.

My wife is finding it difficult to choose work over our family. We have 5 kids, all pre-teen or younger. She works as a paramedic in a large city in the US. If you see a first responder (ER Nurse, Paramedic, Police Officer, ER Doctor) or know one, tell them thank you. Tell them you appreciate their sacrifice. Talk to your kids about how paramedics and other first responders are heros.

My wife talks about her work with me a lot. It is a pretty thankless profession. In the 10 years she has worked as a paramedic; getting spit on, groped, cursed at, lied to, blamed, threatened, and more, occur too often. Patients are in pain, patients often don't want help, more often then not, patients are not thankful. And, that is fine, it is part of her job, she knows that. But, she needs to know that the society she helps protect deeply appreciates her.

Why? Because every morning, she leaves behind her kids and the safety of her home, and normally that is an easy enough decision. But now that the United States is marching closer to a situation similar to the chaos in Italy. She is having a much harder time rationalizing her decision to leave the kids behind every day. I want to comfort her, but I am her husband and I can only do so much. I can see the anxiety in her eyes, caused by the worry of things to come. She has been more irritable and understandably so. Luckily, things haven't gotten really bad in our area yet and I pray it stays that way.

A couple of days ago, the ambulance she normally works on (she wasn't on shift), had to lock its doors and call the cops for support, because some hysterical person started pounding on the doors demanding face masks. Like I said, our city hasn't exploded with cases yet, it is scary that people are already behaving that way. How will they behave when things get as bad as Italy?

It would make a world of difference for my wife, and first responders like her, if someone she didn't know came up to her at the grocery store and thanked her. Or maybe a forgotten friend called her with words of encouragement.

She has a little bit of post traumatic stress disorder from her job. Sometimes when she is playing with our youngest child, she will see the face of a dead baby from one of her calls at work. She has seen lots of death, some truly creepy stuff, some really sad things (like having to tell parents their newborn baby died). She has witnessed great things too, like, once she delivered a baby in the back of her ambulance, another time she was one of the first people in our city to successfully use some sort of chilling suit to stall the damage from someone's stroke, and at this point she has brought back quite a few people from death. She used to talk about bringing people back to life with Narcan, she'd tell me how cool it was for their lifeless bodies to spring back to life. These day, she has administered Narcan so many times that it is old news, a common occurrence for her.

We have talked about her getting Covid-19 and how our family will handle it. Basically, we assume she will get it soon and so will I. When she gets sick, we are going to quarantine her in the back bedroom and hope for the best. But, getting infected isn't my biggest worry, we are youngish and healthy. My biggest worries are her mental health and her safety.

If our city gets as bad as Italy. She is going to be seeing death on a level she has never experienced before. Depending on how bad it gets, she might be tasked with triaging patients. Triaging means she will have to decide who lives and who dies. They have been trained multiple times on triage protocols, but she has never had to do it. It is only ever necessary during mass casualty events when the healthcare system cannot handle the load of patients. Imagine having to decide that someone will not get treatment because they are more sick than another and we don't have enough space in the hospital to care for both patients. And then, imagine the next time she has to look at her dad (my father in law) and forever she sees the faces of the older men that she sent to the triage tent. She became a paramedic to help people, not to leave them to die.

Did you know that more people died during the Spanish Flu Pandemic (50 to 100 million) than died in World War I (16 to 30 million)? Imagine being asked every day to go off to war to fight Covid-19 and leave your kids behind. At some point, after seeing enough death, it would take some real courage to head to work for the next shift. So, please, find a first responder and tell them thank you. Don't hug them or shake their hand (social distancing), but somehow let them know you love them, show them you understand the sacrifice they are making, and that they are your hero. I know my wife needs that, and if she needs it, I am sure other first responders do too.

Please share this to FB, my hope is that enough people will read it and decide to reach out to a first responder and that one day my wife will run into someone who will thank her and boost her morale. I posted this with my anonymous reddit account, because I don't want her knowing I wrote this. Thanks everyone.

 My brother just said something makes me really mad. He word for word told me that suicide rates and alcoholism is worse than corona and the US should focus more on that. Along with that the healthy should be able to leave their houses. He also said the flu is way worse. He wont believe me that these arguements are ridiculous. Can someone please provide me with some credible sources and statistics so he has some clarity.

 My parents are on the military base being quarantined. Throw away account. I don’t want this getting back to me, because people are being so weird, but i think it’s important to let people know what’s going on there.

The news has been misinforming people about what happened on the ship and secretive about the base.

They have severe ptsd, and I assume it’s prevalent for a lot of passengers. One of my parents had a panic attack, when told to go back to their room. It was rather most heart wrenching thing I had ever heard. They said something like, “ they aren’t putting me in a cage again,” I think as referencing to being stuck in their room, and flash back to the ship. They said, “ they will have to shoot me,” and cried. I cried telling them not to hang up, I love them, and I will be here for them. 

It might be overly dramatic to some, but this is what Americans, and employees stuck on the ship are going through. 

There is no time limit for how long they are being held, they have “ caseworkers” but no info or access. No tests are being given. 

I will try to depict their experience. If the want to share, I will post.

 The issue specifically in the USA, is that we obviously have a huge problem, but half the country, no matter what, will pretend it doesn't exist or if they do acknowledge it, that it was inevitable Half the country have convinced themselves that any deaths were inevitable anyway and that their family members and friends aren't really dying of coronavirus and they'll resist more isolation no matter what. The media will always give them disproportionate screen time, because that creates a more interesting story, skewing the narrative against taking reasonable precautions.

A lot of people understand that the pandemic never ended but millions more are being misinformed by either the media or Trump. We could literally hit 1M deaths in the US this year and half of the country will either pretend it didn't happen or act like it was unavoidable anyway.

 Mortality rate for the young and healthy is likely to be incredibly low! Pulled some data from CDC statistics and wrote this article. If you have heard that a significant number of young healthy people are dying from COVID-19 and that "reinfection" is proven and a problem, please read this. 
++++++++++
 What if we begin purposefully infecting healthy people and isolating them. I'm worried about what happens in a month when the quarantines are over and we go back to work, won't the virus just come back exactly the same. We need some sort of long term solution.

The way I see it there is only one solution and that is a lot of people, hopefully healthy people, get infected and consequently build a level of immunity.

So what if we, on a volunteer basis and after a period of health screenings, start bussing healthy people to Air Force Bases and infecting and isolating them. I know this sounds crazy but honestly unless we come up with a miracle vaccine or antiviral in the next month or two lots of people will die.

 If you get Coronavirus, you may never fully recover. Disappointed to see that a lot of people are still shrugging off COVID-19 as just another "cold" or hoax, and think that even if they get it, they'll just go asymptomatic or have flu-like symptoms at worse.

Influential music artist Brad Jordan is 49 years old, a COVID-19 survivor, and will now go on dialysis four times a week, three hours each time, for the rest of his life.

Basically, he's going to spend twelve hours every week getting salt, waste, and water pumped out of his kidneys until the day he dies.

Even those who are young, healthy, have no underlying conditions, and have survived COVID-19 may come out with permanent lung damage, suffer from heart and kidney failure, and experience Post-Intensive Care syndrome.

If you get Coronavirus, you may never fully recover. It's better to never get it in the first place.
++++++++++
 What exactly is making people die from Covid-19? Forgive me if this is a stupid question. I’ve been googling and reading as much as I can on everything coronavirus. And I know who the high risk groups are. But what exactly is making people die from it? What is it from the illness itself that makes it so dangerous? I get that the elderly are weaker and cannot fight it like the younger people. But young people have died from it too. Shortness of breath is one of the symptoms. So is it that their lungs give out? Can cause you to stop breathing? I dont understand...
++++++++++
 How Many Deaths Will be Cannibalized? The likely death rate in the US by year end is scary as shit but how many of those are likely to  be cannibalized from other illnesses? I would suspect at least some of those that will die would have died from other illness like the flu, cancer, heart diseases, etc.
++++++++++
 I need to be clear about the purpose of social distancing. Could someone offer some minor insight? (Frustrated &amp; Venting) From what I understand, every single human on the planet earth *will indeed* get sick with the corona virus. Me, you and everyone will get sick with the virus. Doesn’t matter how much hand sanitizer, alcohol, bleach, hand washing, gloving, hazmat, face masks, distancing or complete jail lockdown we do because it will not work to do anything other than prevent a mass amount of people from getting sick at once. But you *will still* be getting sick. There’s nothing at all anyone can do to stop it. That’s it.

From my understanding, despite all of these efforts the virus is still spreading with hundreds of new cases daily in Italy. Again so we’re not even speaking to anyone &amp; people are getting sick. HOW???? That for me is what I need to know. If you’re not literally seeing people how is it still jumping around. I’m starting to think there’s another source like how they couldn’t figure out that cholera was coming from the water wells situated next to human waste sites (nyc). Like is the wind carrying it?

People with health conditions are the ones most at risk of death. But everyone who catches this virus is more likely to die.

I’m not even trying to be ignorant here. I’m frustrated with the endless news about how nothing is happening everywhere, efforts are completely futile &amp; every human will die. 

So what’s the point of all of this hysteria if everyone will die? Might as well kick back and wait.
++++++++++
 Can I just say, the number of people saying "Coronavirus is no big deal" shows just how much people don't care about the sick or elderly Like seriously, my mom's 70, my brother in law is 60 and just got pneumonia, my wife is pregnant. I'm sick of how many people on social media are saying this is no big deal, it will pass, blah blah, like they don't know any higher risk people.

 Am I the only one who’s not afraid? I live in Florida and the coronavirus has arrived! It’s expected that it will begin to spread around soon and many people will catch it. People are in a panic and events are even being cancelled due to the virus. Me on the other hand is just eh about the news. I have a low immune system and catch everything that goes around but I’m still not scared if I catch coronavirus. I believe if I catch it that everything will still be ok. Is this attitude for coronavirus normal?
++++++++++
 What do you say to some that says this to you? So being concerned about the 99%+ who WONT die from coronavirus is selfish and uncaring? Being concerned about families who have no source of income because of the lockdown is being reckless and self-serving? Tell me again how righteous you are?

This is coming from a "its just the flu bro" evangelical nutter.
++++++++++
 Any words of wisdom from people in highly affected areas? I live in an area that just got our first positive. Note, we just got test in so I’m sure that makes a difference. Back to question... people here are saying “if no one had told you about this virus would your life be any different than flu season” I answered about statistics of hospitalization and number of beds etc. So how is it where you are? Is it as bad as we see... people being turned away... or is it just blown up and what people here think?

 Vaping Pneumonia and Coronavirus (Only a personal opinion, Not blaming anyone. I just hope we can find out the origin of COVID, and kill it.)

About Aug.\~Nov.,2019 , people in Salt lake City first diagnose the unknown-reason pneumonia. Since most of the patient smoke e-cigarettes, so they called it "Vaping related pneumonia".

To Nov.,2019, the disease has had taken 50 of people lives and sicken at least 2000 people.Though, the death rate compare to COVID19 are very little. However, Maybe the virus mutated after bringing it to Wuhan and become the fatal COVID19. You may asking how to "bring" it to China. Oct.,2019 wuhan hosted Military World Games, include US army. maybe it's the time virus came to China.The first confirmed diagnosis patient in the beginning of Nov..the timeline is some what coincidence. (I'm blaming our army, maybe he is a no-symptom patient)

"Patient tested for infectious diseases. They tested for bacteria. They tested for viruses. It all came back negative." said by a doctor in Salt Lake City. The situation is just as same as the time China first diagnosis COVID19 patient, patients coughing, fatigued, and had high fever.

Though a doctor said that the pneumonia is not infectious. However, there are still a lot of uncertain factor, like the sample are too small and lack of scientific research. it is, by another word, his own medical experience.

Scientist can do more research on the "vaping pneumonia", maybe we can benefit from it through the period.

Last but not least, stay strong the US, stay strong the whole world. we can conquer the virus.

 We need to stop portraying this virus as one that kills the elderly and doesn't do anything to young people. Its not that simple. Plenty of young people suffering and dying as well as plenty of immunocompromised individuals of all ages. Also, in North America we are going to see a lot of people die from this due to their obesity and diabetes, as well as their drug addictions and much more.
++++++++++
 How the increase in cases might be a good thing: seeing a light in the darkness. This is my point of view but I believe it makes sense that everyone says that it'll get worse before it gets better as an increase means that we might be reaching the total peak in cases by population and afterwards, the cases will then dip and we'll see more healthy people than I'll people. It's like a roller coaster where the train goes so high enough for it to finally come down to where it's over, case in point, New York as it's reported to have a decrease in cases. Hopefully like a roller coaster and with all the magic of modern medicine, the speed of how many people recover will be really fast so that the illness will be contained and we can go resume our daily lives, or at least with some fixing, before the year is out.

 Where is this "panic" I keep hearing about? Perhaps it's easier to see in an area like NY or Washington but I keep hearing officials and internet know-it-alls referencing this unnecessary panic. What is that looking like? Because I see a lot of news coverage and people with full shopping carts but I don't see any discernable panic. Are they just getting the vibe from social media and maybe people calling in asking questions?
++++++++++
 This is getting ridiculous People are bailing out on vacation weekends cause of this virus the media loves to strike fear with. I survived the Swine Flu when I was 9 and that killed over 600,000 people in a year. It has a 3% fatality rate. Unless you’re elderly or live in China you are not at the risk of death from the virus. You’re more likely to die from a shark than to corona virus and you have a higher chance of dying from a misquote than a shark. 

My aunt lives down the street from someone that is infected in Washington and they are not locking themselves into a doomsday bunker. Quit the fear mongering.

 Is discouraging face masks for healthy people bad advice? Health officials encourage handwashing but discouraging face mask wearing to protect from the coronavirus. Only use one if you’re sick. But considering this is so contagious because asymptomatic healthy-feeling people seem to be unknowingly infecting everyone, is this bad advice in hindsight? Shouldn’t we be encouraging everyone to wear face-masks in public so that more asymptomatic people aren't spreading it? There’s the problem of supply shortage among people who need it most like doctors/nurses, but that doesn’t seem the motivation for the advice that healthy people shouldn’t bother wearing it.
++++++++++
 Vaccines are not magic gold dust This isn't going to end once 2020 ends. You'll still have to wear masks and socially distance even once we have a vaccine, which means well into 2021.

* Baker and Snyder remind us that "it's not over when the vaccine arrives."
* Zhang has told us that "so much hope is riding on a breakthrough, but a vaccine is only the beginning of the end."
* Fauci says "normal life may not be back until the end of 2021."
* Kopp says that "daily life may remain disrupted after the vaccine launch."
* Johnson says "a coronavirus vaccine won’t change the world right away."
* Redfield, the *CDC director*, says that "coronavirus vaccines won’t be widely available till the middle of next year."
* Offit, co-inventor of the rotavirus vaccine, has said, "People now see vaccines as a magic dust that’s about to be sprinkled over this country and make this all go away. It doesn’t work that way."

 ELI5: If China is starting to return to normal, why do so many people on here think we will not return to normal until January? I'm genuinely wondering. I try to avoid reading much on the virus because it makes me too freaked out so I skim headlines here for the most part. Yes, I'm still doing social distancing and everything I need to do, I just don't like to read up on it much.

I'm asking because I've seen plenty of people say they think kids won't be back in school by September, that things won't be normal by January etc. But I have family who live in China who have said that life is actually slowly going back to normal there. So if that's happening why do people say here it's going to take so much longer?

Please don't flame me in the comments, I'm just asking a question and trying to understand

 What would happen if we just ended social distancing a month or two from now? Realistically what would happen? In February, I heard "if coronavirus makes its way to the western world, there is no way that they will be able to implement China's authoritarian measures". In March, the US,UK and multiple other major western countries said fuck it, let's implement some of these measures for a month or two in order to prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed. Now in April, people are starting to make a joke about all of this and talk about how they "cope" with being stuck inside and that social distancing is the "new normal" and we better get used to it. What if we followed sweden and ended social distancing a month from now instead of a year from now. Would the consequences be major? Would people start dropping dead?

 People are so DUMB Italy’s healthcare infrastructure has completely shut down. Iv read countless stories of people being isolated in their homes with their dead relatives stuck with nothing to do with the bodies because no funeral homes will come take it, ambulances will not come to get people and the hospitals are at max capacity. If we don’t seriously contain this it’ll happen in the US too. Our healthcare, hospitals will never have the space to keep up with it 

The death rate is estimated to be 3% for those who get it. I read an article earlier saying that top physicians predict 70-150 million people will contract this virus in the US. That is 4.5 million deaths. 4.5 MILLION. That won’t be all old people. Virus’s mutate as they progress. Virus’s can become deadlier as time goes on. 

I don’t understand why people are still trying to down play this.

 Homelessness and Coronavirus I spend about half my year backpacking across country while my work season is off, living out on the streets, currently in Austin texas and have low hope of getting picked up hitchhiking with this whole Coronavirus thing going on. Theres an extremely large homeless population here. What's expected of the homeless people as things are getting more serious? I just went to a church that feeds the homeless but they wont let you take your food to go because people have a littering problem, which I understand, doesnt it sound unsafe to stick a ton of poor people with bad hygiene into a small room together though? What happens to the homeless if some kind of quarantine happens? Do we just die on the streets or do they put us in hotels? Sorry this is a lot, but I've been getting more and more concerned about all this stuff.

 People need to understand that this is NOT over... In today's affairs, it is really astonishing to see so many people walking around as if everything is normal when thousands of people are getting infected and dying every single day. We have over 5 million cases and nearly 165,000 deaths and people are going out unnecessarily and getting together with people who don't live with them. Some people have stopped wearing their masks and social distancing. There are also some who have never followed the guidelines, to begin with. It genuinely worries me to see so many people acting like everything is back to "normal" when we are actually much worse off than we were when this whole thing initially started.

 Tall People At 6 Feet More Likely To Catch COVID-19, Claims New Study

 We need to stop thinking our government inept and start thinking they have ulterior motives. Let's be real it's easy to assume they don't know what they are doing and satisfying to say "That guy is an idiot, I know better."  Nobody is perfect so I'm not saying they don't make mistakes, but if my dumbass saw this coming they did too.  

Let's assume that instead our government does indeed have all the facts.  They employ thousands of analysis, spys, researchers, government relations people ( I did say I was a dumbass but you know what I mean, a bunch of people to get information that citizens won't ever have access to).  Now look at every decision they make, again assuming they know more than you.  

Example, Total Lockdown/Shelter in place until a cure or the virus is snuffed out.

Pros:
Save millions of lives
Prevention of permanent damage to those who survive.

Cons:
Cripple the economy stocks drop, buyers aren't buying sellers can't sell.
Fund 350 million people who can't work.

I'm not saying that their decisions are influenced by the super pacs that fund their campaigns, and private donations from the people who own the majority of corporations.  Nor am I saying, the people funding the donations will be hurt the most by a lockdown and would be least affected if 10% to 15% of the population dying quickly.  I would never say that Flint Michigan is an example of anything but the government not caring about people.  

What I am saying is stop assuming they are all fools, after all it's better to be thought a fool than to be known as intentionally putting profit before human life.  Not that corporations have ever said , "it was cheaper to settle out of court than to recall."

imagine being so gullible you believe everything the media tells you. have you ever seen a virus with your own eyes? no? yet you BELIEVE viruses exist?

That's how religion works . belief in viruses and other germs is no less a religion than believing in Judaism or Islam.  only those who believe in germs end up dying from germs because the stress causes their immune system to shut down.

 We are beyond fucked. Grocery stores like Black Friday. Traffic bad. Not a mask to be found. Went for an early grocery store run. Eastern PA. 150 people at each entrance lined up right. Not a single mask. 

Traffic today was like normal rush hour. 

We need a forced lock down like now. People are fucking morons. We also need a better way to handle supply runs. Hundreds packed together for a half hour is just a disaster waiting to happen.

 Why are we calling it panic shopping? The people buying now are being prepared... (the tldr) Just a thought: 

Panic shopping is when I'm buying my kids crazy socks at 9pm the day before crazy sock day. Being prepared is buying them a few days/week before. Being a prepper means I have 15 pairs of crazy socks in all sizes so when its crazy sock day the biggest issue is fit. 

IN SOME PLACES yes, they are at the 11th hour. But for the rest of everyone its not "panic" as much as beefing up. 

Preppers could call those of us beefing up last month panic buyers- but right now there isnt panic. Nobody is fighting over toilet paper like a cabbage patch doll... yet.

 Maybe given the mass amounts of apathy the people buying 4 weeks ago paved the way for the orders to be beefed up for those who are aware and preparing now, which will beef up stock a bit for the real panic buyers once the media actually causes panic. 

Discuss away!

 I was made fun of for wearing a mask to protect others from whatever sickness I had I’ve been home sick for the past few days with something that causes a hellish sore throat, definitely not Coronavirus. Though today I had to leave the house to go grocery shopping. I raided the medicine cabinet and saw that we had surgical masks likely from ‘09. I of course popped that bad boy on considering I was coughing constantly.

I went and drove to the grocery store and I could feel the people staring, at one point some teenager even yelled, “It won’t do anything for you man!” And through a raspy voice I’d tell them, “This is so you don’t get sick.” They wouldn’t listen though, it’s funny to make fun of people who take care to not harm themselves or others I guess.

Honestly I don’t truly know what I’m trying to get across with this post. I just feel as if so many Americans have such a conceited mindset and so blindly follow what people tell them, the CDC for example. They also don’t seem to understand basic hygiene or etiquette? Ever since COVID-19 has popped up I’ve realized more and more how little people wash their hands after using the restroom, how little people even try to cover a cough, and generally just how gross many Americans are. 

TLDR: Even if you’re sick and wear a mask people will still look at you funny and even make fun of you. Also people don’t know how to wash their hands.

 The Coronavirus is the most ridiculous thing that has happened in history The Corona virus has got to be the most ridiculous, irrational thing I have ever heard. This virus has put many of you guys in fear, and for good reason. This virus claims to have killed many people, and this and that, but I bet not a single one of you has seen somebody with your two eyes, have this virus. This is not a lecture in an attempt to change your belief on the virus, this is just my view on it, which seems the most relevant out of all the other ones I’ve seen. This virus has caused people to be locked in doors, can’t go outside, see family, etc. This virus was created by the government, and that is nothing but the the truth. I know this post will get removed by reddit very quickly, but for the people who are lucky enough to see this, please don’t fear this virus, it is not real. All this virus is, is an attempt to cover up 5G, and I’m sure many of you have heard that theory now, but it is actually true. The government wants us to be in fear, so well ask for a vaccine. The government is smart, they come out with some virus that claims to have killed thousands of people in only a few months, so of course, people will be on their hands and knees, begging for a vaccination. But, once they do come out with this vaccination, it will control us, and the government will monitor everything we do. It will know everything about us, and it will control you. Whoever may read this, it may sound crazy now, but I want you to take a picture of this, and in about 1-2 years from now, come back to it, and you’ll see everything will come true. Lastly, the government is saying how we should stay at least 6 feet away from each other, but why don’t they have to. Why is it okay for them to be close to each other when they’re in meetings, or when the president has people standing right next to him, all the people in the stands etc. Please, use your head and start to think about these things, because if you fear this, it will eat  you alive

 Is there a curfew in the US? USA has thousands of new cases everyday. That got me wondering if you guys have a curfew and aren’t allowed to go to work, or people just self isolate themselves. Because here in Saudi Arabia we have a curfew from 6pm to 4 am (starting from 3 pm in some cities) and anyone caught outside will be fined up to 10,000 riyals (2,700$). Is it the same in the USA or no?

 The USA should begin a severe 6-8 week lockdown right now. It would be very tough and probably economically damaging, not to mention causing other damage such as mental health and social problems. But it would stave off a far greater amount of damage in all categories in the longer run. I've been reading several experts who are advocating for this kind of lockdown to happen right now.  Problem is, the will is just not there for it. You have some parts of the nation doing okay, and some in very bad shape (and only getting worse).

But as difficult as a massive scale lockdown would be, it would prevent far worse damage that will come by not doing much as we wait for a vaccine, one we're not even sure will be effective.  Do we really want this virus to kill 300,000 Americans by Christmas?

We can't fix the economy until the virus is under control.  Most people know that but are just trying to plow through this thing for some reason.  But it'll only get worse.

 Am I the only one that just wants to keep living life rather than panic? We get the point, it’s all over the media, the coronavirus is spreading and killing people, but what they don’t like to share in most articles is that the vast majority recover and they don’t get give details on each person it killed. Most of the the people that die from it are 70+ year old people with underlying health conditions. The flu could have likely killed these same people. Now we have people panicking and buying crazy amounts of toilet paper for what? Do you really shit that much more if you have to stay in for a couple weeks? I’m just saying if we are living in constant fear of something that most likely won’t kill us, are we really living? With that logic, we should be scared to get in our cars every morning because there’s a small possibility we get in a fatal crash. We should stop have sex on the off chance we get AIDS. See where I’m going with this. Death is a part of life and what makes every day worth living. I’d rather make the most of my time here than have exaggerated fears. I mean it’s possible I could get sniped when I walk out my door every day, but I don’t think about it and become a lazy hermit who doesn’t leave my house. I’m a 22 year old male who has never smoked, so I’m not afraid of this shit and I’m gonna keep living my life and do what I enjoy, rather than hiding in my house for months, unnecessarily. I get it if someone is actually sick whether it be coronavirus or anything, they should stay home. But this talk I hear of full on social distancing is excess in my opinion. Why are we gonna ruin the social lives of healthy people who don’t wanna be locked in their houses? I’m no expert, but once you get it and recover, I would think you can’t get it again. I know he caught a lot of heat for saying it, but that guy wishing everyone would get coronavirus might be onto something. We could just get it over with. 98-99% would survive and we could stop fucking talking about it.
++++++++++
 So does anyone believe the 100,000 estimated death count? 66,000 people died of the flu in the US last year. Even with social distancing, people are still going out everyday. Public transportation is still running. 

To think only 100,000 people will die from this entire pandemic across the whole country makes absolutely no sense. 

The flu's mortality rate is .1% this virus is 1-2% with functioning hospitals. If hospitals become overburdened, it'll be even higher. We've seen this happen in many countries already. It just doesn't add up.

I'm worried people will once again think this isn't serious.

 TheWorld.Data.Blog Is Providing Cure Solution, Real Knowledge About Corona Virus NCOV COVID-19 **TheWorld.Data.Blog Is Providing Cure Solution, Real Knowledge About Corona Virus NCOV COVID-19**

The authority, government and many organization are hiding a lot of real info about the new corona virus from the public for whatever reasons like lose the regime, cause chaos or continue enslave the people, not just only China, Vietnam must also including USA, Europe, etc. All over place.

So if you are seeking for the truth information, real knowledge, uncensored news, open discussion, cure &amp; solution for the new corona virus named as NCOV, COVID-19 or SARS-COV-2, then the only webpage online is **theworld.data.blog** and **freejoy.aimoo.com**.

The fact is that the media &amp; government are toying with people’s life. They are only promoting fear and scare to face the truth. They were not telling the real information about the corona virus from the beginning and probably in the future as well.

Even I as a Savior want to telling you the truth, real information about this epidemic with just text-based message, they think me as fear-maker, and delete all the messages online. Many of my information now even scientist was confirmed like the started for this epidemic event from October/November or the real features of this virus, but many still not yet confirmed and verified yet.

If they say cannot talk in the public or big media sites, then it would be ok, but instead they are deny in all fake free speech websites as well.

You need to understand that even the top government officials, top doctors who have access to top notch medical care had died because of this new corona virus, they cannot protect themselves so there is freaking any reason they can protect normal people like most of you.

The new corona virus is not yet peak, the full strength of that virus will only appear in the summer time. The current situation is too dangerous for normal people to deal with.

That why from now I will provide free working cure &amp; solution at private matter for all of you, if you are rich (have more than 5 millions USD worth of asset) then you must donate money, but all with restrict conditions and limited time. But only at **theworld.data.blog** or **freejoy.aimoo.com**.

But if you are willing to open your mind, want to face the scary hard truth, accept new knowledge then you can visit that websites. If you are the anti-christ with big ego and do not want to change, then do not visit.

Remember everything has the limit and I have the final decision of anything on that website.

The authority cannot save you, only you can save you, and only the savior can give you real working advice, cure &amp; solution to overcome this crazy epidemic event.

Best Regard,

 Do we have any information about the virus and vapers? I don’t vape, but I was just remembering that not long ago a lot of media was covering how damaged many vapers lungs are and people were dying sometimes.

 Remember the beginning in China? Them spraying something all over the streets? People collapsing? I followed the virus since January and to be honest was terrified in the beginning before it hit us because I remember seeing videos of streets being sprayed with what people were saying was disinfectant, people just collapsing, people being boarded into their homes, all kinds of wild shit. I thought it would be like that if it ever got over here.. and now here we are 6 months in and everyone plays it off like it is no big deal. Why does it seem as though it was so much worse over in China?

 Have you encountered people saying that they actually want to get the virus "just to get it over with" and then move on? What do you say to such people? I sort of get it.  There are reasons to want to get it.  If you think that getting it in the near term of inevitable anyway, then you might want to just get it and get it over with.  However, you take a massive risk not only for yourself but for passing it on to family, friends, and others.  You could literally doom some people by giving it to them.

The best strategy is for us all to avoid it and then we one day get a vaccine and it'll be done with.

 Doctors And Nurses Say More People Are Dying Of COVID-19 In The US Than We Know

 I don’t understand what warrants all those responses. Please explain to me, I don’t get it. Hi all,

I would like someone to explain to me, like i’m 5 years old, the reason for this huge response to this Coronavirus situation.

Please be respectful, I am genuinely clueless and completely overwhelmed. I don’t understand at all why it is such a big deal. I’m not stupid, maybe misinformed, but I want to understand.

I don’t know what the deal is and why people panic in Italy for this Coronavirus situation. But it’s real and it’s happening: Italy is extending its coronavirus quarantine measures, which include a ban on public gatherings, to the entire country. 

The entire country! Everyone stays at home and people can go out only for work or emergencies.

I’m a 40 years old male, mechanical engineer in a aerospace company. I live in Quebec, Canada.

I feel stupid, like there’s something I don’t understand.  I feel like everyone is taking this situation seriously except me. However the facts are presented, I just can’t understand why there is such overwhelming response.

Why there are cities, provinces and countries which completely stops living, which limits the movements of citizens to the maximum.

Am I wrong in thinking that if I catch this virus, I will have minor flu symptoms ? I rest, drink water and I will be healed.  It's the same for 99% of people. I’m not afraid at all, should I be ? Two persons in their 70s from Quebec caught the virus on a cruise ship and are now completely healed.

Theorize, hypothesize this situation; if there’s no response at all and everyone keeps living normally, there will be a pandemic and a lot of people will catch covid19, then there will be people sick also people dying, but we don’t know how much, and it will be a bit more than the flu but definitely not in a scale compared to a war, cancer, car accident or other cause of death. Why are we changing all our lives for this ?

Can you explain why people need to stop working, stopping the economy, canceling events and all that if the disease will only make very little people sick ?

The pros and cons are clear in my opinion: just keep living normally but with enhanced awareness and attention for cleanliness.

So if I understand correctly, the only reason why whole countries confines themself and avoids public gatherings is to limit the transmission of the virus, which will then protect the 0.8-1.5% of people who can develop serious symptoms, it  is that right?

Thank you very much for you explanations and your patience.

 All this freaking out is stupid You're all freaking out because you're told to do so. Before the stay at home orders and lock downs the virus barely had anyone even talking about it. Then the government shuts stuff down and instant panic mode. Why? Because people do whatever the government wants them to whether you think so or not. They say it's time to freak out over this so everyone starts freaking out. This pandemic was around before the stay at home orders here in the US and no one minded being in huge crowds. Then the next the government says stay inside and everyone freaks out as they are told to do. You're only scared because you're told to be scared.

And as for the precautions they are useless. People without masks are still breathing on things, most people don't wear gloves, we are going to stores touching things that other people touched and breathed on. The 6 feet rule 😂 a sneeze travels like 200 feet and a cough 24 feet. Just more fear mongering brought to you by your government.

It isn't all the government doing this, they partner up with the news media to make sure their fear messages are heard by everyone. It's all about votes and ratings. If covid numbers are down government officials can claim that's all because of the precautions they told us to do and they get more votes and more money. As for the news people like bad news because they like to see people worse off than themselves. Bad news brings in better ratings and more money.

 Today I actually met a guy who believes this is all a hoax. I had no idea what to say. I was standing in line at a retailer that has all the proper procedures in place with security monitoring number of people store, spacing of line up, etc.  the man asked us if we were worried about the coronavirus. “Yes”, I told him. “It’s a real concern”

“It’s funny” he said, “because the hospitals are all empty”

he proceeded to tell us how this was all overblown and possibly even a conspiracy of some sort.

its true that I live in one of the least impacted areas of the country, but it’s still here and I know it’ll get worse before it’s done, so maybe the man had indeed been to a local hospital which is not busy now, but will be soon.

the man walked away and another guy turned to be in line and said “there’s one in every crowd”

 Anti-CoronersVirus v. Pro-Lifers A little bit of a pun for fun there but a serious question.

Where are the Pro-lifers at? Why am I not seeing more news of their movement to save and prevent people from dying not just fetuses? Every life is important right? So now because it’s their life thats on the line it’s “fuck off” mode for them? 

***Optional Reading: Rant***

Even the politicians that at “pro-life” are taking advantage of this world event to even make themselves richer and let other people die. Some GOP pricks made absurd amounts profit on selling their stocks but i doubt that it will be used help even their political base. Not saying all GOP members had done this but it’s the Trump Administration ruling and GOP has the most capacity to save millions of lives(born or unborn). Day after day we see mostly the opposite response from these elected officials and they only act when its almost or when its too late to save lives.

So what I’m saying is that I’m running out of toilet papers and any if these “pro-lifers” gotta give up at least half of a tissue roll for me and I want it extra soft my butt is as sensitive as my lungs. 

All joking aside stay safe and healthy every one let’s come together as a species and fight this unseen enemy. After that let’s continue fighting against each other.

 Fast Food Shortage Update, Weekly Shortages Are To Be Expected So this is kind of an update to my last fast food related post. My last post basically talked about the abundance of business we are getting NOW that this pandemic is happening. Example of the amount of food people buy: 3 taco twelve packs or 3 family sized bucket meals. These are very common now and I’d say the average total per customer is around $30-$50 of food. We only have a population of 9000. 

For the past couple of weeks we have been running out of stock and we think it’ll be a regular occurrence. This is to be expected because we are going through a pandemic. And before anyone gets mad and says we should’ve ordered more and expected it by now, oh boy we did we TRIED. We ordered 8 cases of coleslaw, we got 4. We asked for more and they said they didn’t have any more and were sending larger amounts to the more populated places that need it. I’m glad most people on reddit understand this, but my town is not the average reddit user. 

Many people come by and still get mad and feel entitled to food that we don’t have. They think it’s unbelievable that “one of the only places open is out of the one thing I wanted!” This isn’t even true. All of our fast food places are still open, most restaurants started to do delivery so they wouldn’t have to close, and the Pizza Hut everyone thought had closed really didn’t and everyone just thought that for some reason. They had to write on their windows with washable marker that they are open for take out and delivery and that their pizzas are safe and all employees are currently healthy. Someone literally started this rumor and it hurt the business so bad they didn’t get any business for WEEKS. People act like everything is shut down when practically everything is still open in my town. 

What makes me really mad is that people think it’s such a hassle to get into Walmart now when only 100 people are allowed in at a time. I went there at it’s busiest around 4 pm and got in in 30 minutes. My managers say it usually takes 15 minutes for them to get in. People are acting like they have to wait hours to get inside and that it’s easier to just go to a fast food place. I’d say the wait is shorter at Walmart than at my fast food job right now. Some people have told me that many may not know how to cook. Well I see it as the perfect time to learn how when a lot of people are laid off. I’m sorry I can’t believe that many people don’t know how to cook, and even if they didn’t I don’t really know either but I’ve stopped going as much as I can! I only go when I can’t go to the store if I’m working all day, but there’s loads of meals that don’t take a lot of effort to make. Sandwiches and chips, chicken nuggets or pizza rolls (in the microwave if you’re lazy) hell even a bowl of cereal if you’re that exhausted for whatever reason. Look on the internet for easy recipes if you can’t even come up with anything. I just wish people would realize this isn’t normal life right now. Sorry you drove 20 minutes from another town just to get coleslaw, pretty much every order has a large coleslaw with it. I almost lost it one day because someone tried to tell me it was illegal to not take Canadian money just because we’re an hour away from the border. That day was filled with so many people with ridiculous requests and comments like this. 

The good news out of all of this is that starting Thursday, I’ll be getting paid $15 an hour instead of $12. Almost makes it worth all this trouble, almost. It’s still ridiculous but at least I’m being compensated for it.

 The fall is about to be terrible. I hate to be a doomsayer but I really just want to get this point across. I’m 18, a freshman in college, and I obviously have a lot of people my age on social media. I have people from varying states since the college I’m going to has diversity in that regard (I’m in Texas though). Within the last day I have seen people partying in large clubs with 100+ people, people going to birthday parties the size of concerts, and people partying while in college and just a ton of socializing in large groups. And you know what all of these people are also doing? Bringing it home to mommy and daddy and most likely getting them sick. I mean it’s almost like this virus isn’t a thing anymore. But it isn’t just the heavy socializing happening now, it’s the socializing that’s bound to happen soon. The Halloween parties, the thanksgiving meetups with family, the Christmas parties and meetups...this is arguably the most social time of year, and most people are gonna be showing that pretty soon.

 People think the quarantine will end in X weeks or months...but it won’t end until we find a vaccine because people will always be getting infected and infecting others I think that quarantine is obviously important, but people seem to think of it as something that can end on its own (without a vaccine). For instance, once everyone is quarantined for X days we are all good. Here’s why that won’t work... 

When coming out of quarantine, there will be people at the tail end who are becoming infected one way or another...

And what about Americans returning home? Travelers? They’ll bring infection too when the quarantine ends...

Unless we find a vaccine that works for everyone, and everyone gets vaccinated...people will always be getting infected and infecting others

What are your thoughts?

 People are starting to steal toilet paper from fast food restaurants and retail stores People are panic buying everything. People are buying up toilet paper, tissues, masks, bleach, soap, hand sanitizer, and etc. I just got back from a Target, there are people collecting toilet paper from Target's bathrooms to take home. This is beyond ludicrous and absurd. People are price gouging on the side of streets, "1 Toilet paper roll for $20." It's the Dollar Store brand too.

 Are the majority of deaths of young or healthy patients not caused by the virus? I’ve just been reading about some of the reasons the Spanish Flu killed so many young adults and apparently it had to do with such an able immune system becoming overreactive and causing a deadly cytokine storm, which we’ve since developed treatments for I believe. These are the deaths caused by the rapid progression of organ failure that can happen after symptoms seem to be getting better. If this is the case, can doctors take blood of otherwise healthy patients to monitor their cytokine levels to determine whether to give them immunosuppressive drugs like ibuprofen/corticosteroids/hydroxychloride?

 People in (or interested in) doctor, nursing, nurse aide, respiratory therapist, or really any medical student in general that is necessary in the fight against the coronavirus, you should possibly consider a fast track option to getting the necessary credentials you need to work on the field. Fast track to becoming a doctor:



Fast track to becoming a nurse:







Do you hold a bachelor’s degree of any kind already? It seems like many colleges have a 12 month “fast track” program for anyone with a non-nursing bachelor’s degree:



Fast track to becoming a respiratory therapist:





Fast track to becoming a nurse aide:



If you need student financial aid, here is the FAFSA:



I believe there should be some government financial relief for those who want to become nurses, nursing aide’s, respiratory therapists ASAP, etc. so that we can get as many people into these positions in as short of a time as possible, hopefully individual states will do this in some way first so that it can get traction at the national level.  

Perhaps even faster track curriculums should be enacted as well for those who are close to becoming a doctor, nurse, nurse aide, respiratory therapist, etc. so that even students in those fields who aren’t in their final year can get into the workforce quicker in their professions.

 How does covid transfer to surfaces? I have been reading a decent amount about covid and realize that people can become infected from Objects as well but I still don’t really understand how it’s getting onto surfaces and objects to begin with. Is it just if an item is in an area where the virus is in the air, or does it basically have to be touched or coughed on by an ill person?
Forgive me if this is really obvious I just would like to know and haven’t found much from google about how exactly it’s getting into surfaces and once it’s transferred to a surface how much of the virus is the item actually getting. Thanks

 Why people panicking? Logically speaking, it’s not as bad as other pandemic thane took more lives before. But why ppl are panicking more? 

I think it might be the combination of the abundance of information that people are getting and the decline of confidence in authorities. 

It’s very interesting to see that even tho people in US are embracing collectivism, but once something server or something they think is going to affect themselves, they are very individualism. 

Another reason that why big government is a bad idea...

 As a hospital waiter, I was told I am not allowed to wear a mask at work. I work as a waiter in a hospital in California. I brought my own masks to work, and my manager told me to take it off and I can’t wear it on the floors where the patients are. I touch all the patients’ dirty food trays and take their food order in person.

He asks me how many people my age (19) have gotten sick of the coronavirus to try and convince me I’m not really at risk. I specifically tell him I am concerned about my health still and others I live with, and just want to be extra cautious. He said he can call someone up to explain why I can’t wear the mask, but told me they may be dealing with more pressing matters.  

He also told me it gives off the “wrong message.” But the message seems clear: the universities and schools in our area are closed along with events larger that 250+ people, just a week ago Italy was running as usual and is now locked down, and compared to other countries our testings don’t seem to be on par with, let alone better, than countries with smaller populations. Yet, people in the hospital are looking at me like I’m crazy.

I ignored his order and kept the mask on.

A few minutes later he spots me and asks if I heard anything he said. I tell him he is either going to have to send me home or write me up, because I will not work without the mask. He said he’d call the people and get back to me. I’m still to hear from him. But I feel no matter the reason, I will want to continue wearing my mask.

Even if it doesn’t protect me anymore than not wearing the mask, it gives me piece of mind. I read the flyer they passed out saying how to properly use the masks and have been following their direction.

The only reason I’d think they don’t want the food service workers using masks is to conserve it for people more at-risk. I understand that and haven’t been using the ones from work. I brought them from home. 

On top of that, they are telling other workers they HAVE TO wear a mask if the didn’t get the flu shot. I got the flu shot, but I want to wear the mask still. I would expect they’d be more concerned about the people who didn’t get the flu shot and refuse to wear a mask.

Am I out of line?

 Reopening The Economy With Asymptomatic People I don’t understand how the economy could reopen when a lot people carry the virus and don’t feel anything, ever. trump just said he’s leaving it for the governors to open the economy and they can do it as soon as tomorrow. won’t that just make it roar back immediately because some of the people who have it, won’t feel shit but will spread it to people that will be symptomatic and some die. I can’t understand the logic behind this. we don’t even have enough fucking PPE😂 I’m dumbfounded...

 It’s not our weak lockdowns that’s causing our mental health issues, it’s all the people who are denying the truth and making this worse. How many times have you seen a comment online or had someone tell you that lockdowns (which are barely lockdowns) are causing mental health issues so it’s better if we’re  open and pretend things are normal as long as your healthy.  This is the wrong way of looking at the situation because it ignores the underlying problem which is it’s not the lockdowns that are causing mental health issues but the people who are denying the virus or it’s seriousness  and the people who refuse to wear masks that are dragging this out a lot more than need be.  

Not only is the problem not lockdowns but they can save us from more mental health issues. Imagine if America had taken this seriously for the first 2 months. Imagine if we did a real lockdown and not half assed ones where people could still go to Walmart and Home Depot and plenty of other places. Imagine if there was a national mask mandate and imagine if our police actually enforced these rules. Imagine if our government provided financial assistance to every American during those two months. Imagine how much better things could be today especially our mental health if we had done this right months ago. 

The hoax people, the it’s just a flu or cold people, the people die everyday so what’s the big deal people, the this isn’t that serious so healthy people should live normally people, the masks are against my freedumb people, they are what is ruining your mental health. They are why so many Americans are dead. They are why we’ll be in this mess for a long time NOT the lockdowns which could save us. 

If my comment offends you there is a reason and you should really reflect on what that reason is. 

I also want to add that we are in the middle of a pandemic and that in itself is going to cause mental health issues no matter what solution we try to go with because right now our only solutions are shitty vs really shitty.

 Facebook vs Reddit I got on Facebook recently to see what was going on in my community, and what I have is a bunch of idiots saying this is blown up. As I listen to ppl that are in the heat of this crap saying they are scared etc. yet because all is well in Jefferson County Texas, they believe it’s all good. I see ppl on here saying they are sick and not getting tested, ppl have died... which means some of us have lost family, yet no one seems to give a flying fu*k...
I’m beside myself and really wanna go off on these people that are saying “hey this is not real let’s take a vacation” yet I hear ppl here telling what it’s like to be in NY etc... I’m just in disgust over ppls lack of empathy to the point of losing friends I made when I was 5. When they made a post on FB about taking a trip, I told them I would pay their airfare to go to Kind county Washington for a
Week... she even has Leukemia and is wanting to travel... this almost separates our friendship. I’m so lost. These ppl here think it’s nothing to fear.

 How are people making PPE masks? I’m trying to understand how so many people got ahold of the materials to make masks. Where do you get N95 filter material? Do people just have this laying around if they happen to be into sewing as a hobby?

And if they are making masks that have some sort of pocket in them for a filter, how are they creating a mask that seals off the rest of the area so that air can only come through the inserted filter? If the mask is loose fitting, it will allow air in around the edges. And even if it isn’t, contamination can get through normal stitches and through normal cloth.

 This is too much. I'm gonna leave the group I personally believe that joining this reddit, although helpful, was one of the worst decisions I have ever made. As I major sufferer of anxiety, reading this subreddit has made it worse as I live in fear and reading all this is making it worse so, I will leave and I think most of you guys should if this place is stressing you out. Get informed but don't get overwhelmed. If this stresses you, it's better to leave as well. Goodbye and stay safe.

 What's the problem? I just don't get it. I'm an expat living in Seoul Korea. And I just don't get it. what is the problem in the US? Nothing here in Seoul is closed everyone is going about their normal business of course being careful but wearing masks and being responsible citizens. People eat in restaurants. People go to work. People take public transportation. People enjoy their weekends. We have maybe one or two cases in a week. The difference is the minute that someone is found to be affected they are tested and quarantined and people who may be affected our tracked down and tested. Buildings that areas are wipe down and cleansed. In the United States people bitching about the fact that this is an invasion of privacy and they'll never allow people to be tracked. Are you f****** kidding me? Do you want this s*** to be going on forever? Stop being little babies take the medicine. Where are your f****** masks watch your f****** hands give up what you considered to be a gross invasion of your privacy for the sake of everyone else and yourself and the country and its economy. What the f*** is wrong with you people get with the f****** program grow the f****** up.

 Why are people so damn selfish? I’m so sick of everyone saying that it’s an overreaction to really worry about this. It’s not about YOU, you 32 year old healthy person. Sure you will most likely be fine if you get it...but it’s about the elderly and the ones with the compromised immune systems that you unknowingly pass this virus on to. I’m so sick of people saying it’s no big deal and they won’t get that sick 😡
