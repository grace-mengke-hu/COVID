 Info about false test results. So i have a co-worker who has all the signs o covid. Fever. Cough with extreme amounts of phlegm. Exhaustion. Etc. he went and got tested and came back negative for flu, strep and covid. 

Doc said his white blood cell could is extremely high but they don’t know what he has. 

I am now showing symptoms as well and am waiting results. 

My question is, how often are tests coming back as false negatives right now?

 My high risk family wants to visit me I’ve been quarantining in the Northeast at my home since March and very cautious, while my family is living in a high risk state and thinking COVID is no big deal, even though they have weak immune systems (and somehow have not been sick with COVID). They told me they plan to visit me for 1-2 weeks within a couple months and I said it’s not the smartest idea but they disagree and believe whatever Fox/Trump says. How do I convince them to reconsider? Even if they get tested upon arriving, they don’t like to wear masks or follow any rules. This just seems like a disaster waiting to happen.

 I have been seeing a lot of posts out there about people making masks to donate to hospitals. Is there any merit to this? Are hospitals really accepting homemade masks? Most posts are saying that all that needs to be done is to double layer a piece of 100% cotton fabric. I have yet to see an actual medical authority get behind this. If that’s all that is needed, I have a hard time believing that medical facilities are running out of masks. Fruit of the loom could pump millions of those out a day.  

I just don’t see how hospitals can possibly accept people’s home made masks in place of the real thing. There is no standard of how the masks are being made or sanitized. Is this for real or is this some fad that started on some Facebook group and got blown out of proportion?

 Why are so many celebrities have coronavirus even though only 0.003% of the population are infected? Let's crunch the numbers 

As of 03/18/2020, there are 9,464 coronavirus cases in the United States.    

The U.S. has a population of 330,446,477. 

That mean only 0.003% of the population has coronavirus. 

So how do you get A-List celebrities like Tom Hanks and Idris Elba, seven NBA basketball players, Canadian Prime Minister's wife, a few members of Congress, and other famous people all diagnosed with coronavirus. 

Famous people make up, maybe, 0.000000001% of the population.  It seems it is highly improbable for so many famous people to get coronavirus. There is a higher chance of winning the lottery multiple times.

Most of them have no symptoms. 

My theory is that coronavirus has always existed in the population for a number of years already and the majority of the people have already been infected by it at one point.  Most are have no symptoms or it gets mistaken for the flu. 

It was only discovered for the first time in China, so now they know how to test for it.  As more people get tested for it , of course, the more people are reported to be infected. But it was always there to begin with.

The mortality rate hasn't risen over the years because the percentage of infected people dying from coronavirus is even less than the flu or the people who die from it, would have died anyway from the regular flu since they already have compromised immune systems. 

This may be the biggest farce in the history of man.
