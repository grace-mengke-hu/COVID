 Coronavirus Stimulus Question - Student Hello guys! Not sure if this is the proper place to ask this question, but I have slightly confusing situation. I accidentally filed myself as a dependent on my 2019 taxes (my parents did NOT claim me) but I didn't file as independent. I made an amendment a few days ago to change myself to independent, but I was still curious if I'll be receiving the coronavirus Stimulus check even though I didn't file as independent (but no one claimed me). I lost my job because of the Coronavirus and I actually would benefit from this. Is there anything I can do?

 Restaurant owners hyperboles aren't helping The media is running tons of stories on restaurant industry. And all these restaurant owners are saying the restaurant industry is doomed. E.g., 


"I’m not being hyperbolic in any way: Without government intervention, there will be no service industry whatsoever."

This is not helping. First, many industries are taking a hit. Entertainment, travel, etc. Not just restaurants.

Second, this gloom and doom scenario is not going to happen. Hyperboles like this isn't helping. Eating and restaurants are fundamental to society.  Restaurants are not some newfangled fade that will die. People have been eating at restaurants for as long as we've existed.

When the pandemic is over guess what, people are going to eat at restaurants again. People might not go on a cruise for a few years, but people will certainly eat at restaurants in due time.

Will many restaurants close? Yes. Restaurants have always been highly risky business. Low margins, perishable inventory, high employee requirements, stiff competition. If you are in the restaurant business you pretty much expect your restaurant to fail.

So don't be hyperbolic about how restaurants are doomed. The restaurant industry is losing its credibility when owners say shit like this.

 Stimulus Check Question?? Hey all so I'm from MA. I've still never received a stimulus check and still have no status on the "get my payment" tracker. I did file taxes for 2018 and 2019 far prior to the deadlines. I also did receive my return via direct deposit so I don't understand why the IRS still says that I cannot even check my status.

Any help?

 Sterilization of N95 Respirators is now being used at Hospital in Tennessee I am a CNA at a Level 1 Trauma hospital in Tennessee. I received an email today discussing how new N95 respirator recycling boxes were being placed throughout the hospital. They have found a way to sterilize the masks up to 20 times each within the hospital. These recycled respirators will only begin to be used if mass shortage of N95’s becomes an issue. 

Although masks still appear to be the main concern, I feel that this discovery is noteworthy and hope that it will be used throughout the U.S.

 Will everyone over 24yo receive the $1,200 stimulus check? Hello there, I am 24 years old and I was wondering if I will be eligible to receive the stimulus check?

I just filed my 2019 taxes a couple days ago and marked myself as independent as well.

 Would you switch jobs in current corona climate? Too big a risk? I was offered a new job but have not given my notice at current employer due to the uncertainty of everything impacted by coronavirus (layoffs, quarantine, social distancing, etc). I've been with my current employer for 5+ years and am well respected, highly relied on by my peers. I currently work for a very large health insurance company and the new job would be working for a MUCH smaller company in similar industry. It is not an issue of pay as it would be close to current salary but a better title/role. Would you take a chance and switch jobs with everything going on or stay put? Please help, this has been weighing on me for a while and I need to make a decision by end of week. Thank you.

 Devising strategy to support local restaurants- are franchise owned restaurants like McDonald’s and chili’s going to be alright? 
So I was able to rearrange my budget so that I can almost triple what I spend every month on eating out by cutting down on other expenses that I mostly can’t do anyway with the quarantine. I was able to map out all the local restaurants in my tax district which is 14 if not including chains like chic-Fil-A, McDonald’s and chili’s but is 32 if including them. I’d love to support every single one but with 32 I simply can’t eating 3 meals a day. I know that a lot of chain restaurants are actually franchises that is bought into and owned by one guy who can lose everything if that goes under, but my question is do you think that those owners can receive assistance from corporate and will make it through alright? If so then as much as it pains me I can cut out the chain restaurants and focus on supporting the 14 local owned restaurants, which is much more manageable. I’m sure it might change company to company but I’d appreciate your feedback on any of them. There mostly the fast food ones Bk, Wendy’s, McDonald’s, chic fil-a, dominos etc. and some larger ones like Chilis, and Applebee’s. Thanks guys.

 Sorry if this doesn’t belong here (unsure where else to post this), but who all would qualify for the $1000 checks from the stimulus package? I can’t find much info on this anywhere.

 [AMA Request] Government official that can answer definitively questions about the covid-19 stimulus checks and unemployment benefit boosts I posted this in the IAMARequests sub but I'm not sure that gets much traffic.  Adjusting that post a little bit and posting here too.  Remove if it is not allowed here.  I am concerned about some people I know getting the accurate info (and quick so they can act on updating info, filing taxes, etc) about how to benefit from the checks and unemployment benefits, especially people in less "normal" situations.

Wondering if it would be possible to get an official person on here to answer the peoples questions about this new bill and who qualifies, how much, tax implications, etc etc. I have been seeing a lot of questions and the answers have been mostly speculation rather than direct sources/definitive answers.  

If not, if someone could clarify some of the questions below that would be great haha.

Example questions:

\- What if someone didn't file in 2018 and haven't filed 2019 taxes, or vice versa?

\- Will people have to pay back money at the end of the 2020 tax season?

\- How much more will people get for unemployment? Is it guaranteed 600 dollars a week more, or a varying amount?

\- If someone has been out of work for "X" amount of time can they qualify for benefits, in the case that I am not able to find a job now?

\- What if some was was/is in college and did not pay taxes in 2018/2019?

\- Is it too late to file 2018/19 taxes to be included in the payment?

\- What if someones address is not updated?

 Where are vital statistics for US 2020? There are people who believe that the death rate really hasn't gone up due to covid. They say, "well, maybe deaths in March 2019 were the same as March 2020". They base this fact on how they can't find the total deaths each month in the US for 2019 and 2020. I know a few of them and want to disprove their claims. I want to compare deaths during a time without covid to a time with covid. I tried to search for this data, but also can't find it. The best I can do is find total deaths in Jan, Feb, and March 2019. But I can't find any data after March 2019.

Shouldn't these be available as vital stats? I see media reports that deaths are up, but where are they getting the data to base this on if it isn't posted anywhere to fact check?

 I absolutely despise women. Furthermore I don't care about anyine else but myself- that includes whatever course this disaster takes. 
society over values holes. Women shouldn't be allowed to vote or have as many rights as men ( until they enlist in the draft) you are whores, not queens and should be treated as such. Let's be real here. Women don't actually take the time to research the issues ( they are not smart enough and I'd honestly be surprised if the majority can even read). They vote for presedential candidates based on who's " the most hot" and only run for office for the attention.

Society over values women. The majority of women are stupid and uneducated ( look at how few women are successful compared to men, and piggy backing on your boyfriend's/ husband's success doesn't count-sluts. I will personally value women the moment society as a whole acknowledges incels as being just as deserving of special rights as women. ( I'm not an incel but I am their champion).

 Have Ulcerative Colitis and chose not to return to work. What are my next steps? Hey! Even if you don’t have an answer for me, thanks for reading! I work at a restaurant/bar/party venue that is reopening and I made the decision not to return based on my current health situation and because I’m in contact with my 95 year old grandmother.

I know you can’t receive unemployment benefits for a “general concern” of covid. But I do believe I can make an appeal with my situation at hand.

My Question:

How do I do this? Do I file a completely new claim now that my job offered me a position back? Is there a different way to file based on having a compromised immune system?

If anyone has dealt with something similar I’d love to hear advice. It is incredibly unclear through google searches what exactly I should be doing.

 If the coronavirus stimulus checks happen.. is it based on your 2018 income or the tax return you filed in 2018? Might be a stupid question. Since tax returns are based on the previous years income I’m just wondering what they’re referring to. But let’s say someone made 80k in 2017, then they filed that return in 2018. In 2018 they made 50k, then filed that return last year in 2019. Which one of those are they going to use?  

Just confusing me because I read an article that said it’s based on your 2018 tax return and then said if you made less than 75k in 2018 you’re eligible, but the tax return you filed in 2018 is based on your 2017 income?

 Am i eligible for the stimulus check? 26  and live with family, TECHNICALLY a  dependant. I ALMOST put that i wasn't a dependant on my return because i'm not legally required to, but i DID check off the box "can someone claim you as a  dependant"

My question is this, my family never actually claimed  me  as a dependant. I know when someone claims someone as  a dependant they input their social security number and name. Since my parents DIDN'T do this, to the IRS it might seem as i'm not a dependant.

I'm assuming the system the IRS is going to use to screen out who gets checks and how much will be automated. Likely going to gooff social security numbers. I can't imagine how they would  have a system to screen for things like that because every tax website (think turbotax) has the question worded a bit differently or in a different location. 

&amp;#x200B;

So based on that, i should technically recieve the stimulus check correct? If i don't can't i amend it and just say i'm not a dependant, and that i was homeless and used my parents address simply for paperwork and mailing purposes to qualify?

 Ukrainians appeal President Zelensky to help curb Violence Against Women in the nation   Ukraine has approved the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and has marked but not yet confirmed the Council of Europe's Istanbul Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women. A large number of Ukrainians have appealed President Zelensky to present the convention to Ukraine's parliament, the Human Rights Watch stated.

The appeal was in light of a report by a domestic violence support group in Ukraine, stating it had gotten numerous complaints on phone calls than usual from ladies amid the coronavirus crisis since the pandemic began.

According to the UN report, Gender-based violence is continuing in Ukraine, with 90 % of cases are about violence against women. Political conflict and instability have detrimentally impacted on the situation of women in the nation and gender equality. 

During the Covid-19 pandemic crisis, reports of domestic violence against women have also surged. Women around the world have filled social media with testimonies, and photos regarding ill-treatment, and gender bias.

While we commend the contribution of women during the pandemic, it is important to remain careful about the many negative aftermaths of the crisis that shows an increase in the number of violence against women and the girl child. Especially in Ukraine, complaints of domestic violence against women have doubled, the *UN News* reported.

A recent report by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Ukraine found that 66% of women surveyed said they had "encountered physical, psychological or sexual assault from their spouses or accomplice since the age of 15." 

In 2017, Ukraine passed a domestic violence law, but as per social activists and citizens, more is required. President Zelensky stated recently that he would present the convention to the Verkhovna Rada when the Ministry of Social Policy and the Foreign Ministry notifies him. Human Rights Watch has written to both the ministries, requesting them to pay urgent attention to the matter.

 Are there sectors of the professional world that are holding up okay right now?  

I work for a start-up and I'm about to lose my job very soon when the company runs out of money (I have an eye on the finances and it's about Now). It seems like almost everyone I know, in all different fields, are experiencing pay cuts, slashed hours, and lost jobs right now.

That said, during the 2008 financial crisis, which affected a massive number of people, the company I worked for wasn't impacted by loss of revenue, so we were insulated from the stress of that. I've since spoken to people who found it hard to believe any company was thriving around 2008 because all they saw was devastation.

I'm trying to understand is the likelihood that any companies will still be hiring for positions like Executive Assistant when my current job goes under.

i.e. Am I in a bubble of people whose jobs are severely impacted by coronavirus, but larger companies in XYZ sectors are still doing fine? Or is this more "We are all screwed. Let go of your experience and set your expectations at 0. You're lucky if you can get any job at all."

 Can't believe I can't find this 6 months into the pandemic: Is there any source for what current covid-19 tests are available in the U.S. and what their accuracy/reliability is? I think I read there are somewhere between 70-100 different tests out there, but can't seem to find any reliable data on each of their performance history now that we have millions of tests done. If I recall, the FDA originally "approved" over 100 different tests based on very little data, as low as 60 samples? by the manufacturers in order to simply get enough tests out there. And it seems they either don't require more data about them now that they've been out there all this time, or they don't seem to make it public. 

If I further recall, the FDA did their own testing and "certified" just a couple tests originally, but I don't know which ones or how those worked out after mass deployment. 

This seems like it would be one of the most important pieces of information that should be compiled if testing is supposed to mean anything. I've generally heard tests are about 70% accurate, which is scary, but it's meaningless to someone if they're being tested and don't even know how accurate the specific test they're taking is. 

I'm probably not that good at researching this, but has anyone found any info on this? Government data, research studies, Consumer Reports-type articles, anything?

 If you were claimed as a "dependent" in 2018 and filed as an "independent" in 2019, you might be SOL with the Stimulus check until you file your taxes in 2021. After repeated calls, I was finally able to reach an IRS representative on the phone. For the select group of individuals who were claimed as a "dependent" in 2018 and filed as an "independent" in 2019, despite filing your taxes prior to the original April 15th deadline (and despite receiving your tax refund), an "unspecified" cut-off date was created by the IRS Automated system defaulted and used your 2018 taxes.

As a recent graduate and an individual who filed my taxes on March 3rd of this year, I was told that there is no ability for the IRS at this time to make manual changes to the system. Despite being told that I am eligible, the IRS representative stated that we will have to wait until 2021 to file and will receive "1200 tax credit" which makes absolutely no goddamn sense. It's not like recent graduates are neck-deep in student loans, working entry-level positions (potentially laid-off), and have virtually no accrued savings.

The problem lies within the "automated" system and the inability for representatives to make "manual" changes to this system. Yes... the same system that sent a ton of checks to "deceased" individuals and even a British citizen. I am in contact with an IRS media representative and will provide further updates as to my progress with this.

For the time being... I implore all of those who fit this description to reach out to their Representatives and push the IRS to provide the ability to make "manual" edits to this system. It's been 60 goddamn days, the Canada Revenue Agency processed these payments in three days. If you're tired and angry, it's time to get what is yours and harass your representatives with this important issue.

\* If you have any particular questions for the IRS representative, please comment with them and I will provide further updates. Wish me luck on this journey down this rabbit hole of bureaucratic bullshit.

With love,

 Pertaining the relief check (I haven't filed taxes in 18/19) So I have not filed my taxes for the year of 2018 or 2019 yet do need to for my 2019. As I understand it per IRS website is that if you didn't fill out either tax return and made over the maximum to not need to file that I need to file before I am able to get said check. With the IRS and most major business offices closed how am I supposed to obtain the information to even fill my taxes at this time? It looks to me that me and anyone else in my situation are screwed until the IRS opens back up. I really do need the check as I am down to part time work and there is no work where I live and bills will keep coming. This would help to alleviate my problems a lot since my bills are less than half of the check itself. So anyone have any suggestions as to what I could possibly do or am I just up a river without a paddle? Thank you.
