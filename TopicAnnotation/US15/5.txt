 Possible suggestion for parents who have to work while their children school from home Hi.  This is just a possible suggestion, not sure if it will work for most families but I thought I'd throw it out there in case it may help even a few people out.

I know there are a lot of parents who have to work outside their home but are not comfortable sending their child/ren back to school in-person and there are schools who have chosen to start out the year going a completely virtual route.  If childcare is an issue or if you feel your student will need help with schoolwork during the day and you cannot be there to help them, maybe you can talk to your school district or someone in the community about organizing a group of older responsible/trustworthy high school students to go to a younger students house each day.  If the whole district is online learning and social distancing, there are probably many high schoolers who would welcome the opportunity to do their work in a setting other than their home and it would probably do a lot for their morale right now for them to be able to help out a younger student from their district.  It would also be beneficial to the younger student because the older student was likely taught the same methods in which the younger student is being taught, and would be easier for the younger student to learn from them.  It might also create positive bonds within the varying grade levels of the school district that normally would not have had a chance to form if school was operating on a usual basis.

I feel that if something like this can be implemented, it could effectively create a positive sense of community coming together to get through a crisis by helping one another out and, even though the students are not getting the same level of socialization they would be getting in school, they would still be getting some personal interaction with others and possibly even forming good relationships with older students, which would increase confidence and positivity which they can take back to school with them once school does reopen safely.  I believe there are opportunities, even amid the chaos we are now experiencing, to show the children of this generation that when people band together, do the right thing, help each other and look out for each other, we can accomplish more and overcome more than we think we can.

I'm sure there are some flaws with this suggestion and it might not work for a lot of families, but I thought it may be something that someone might be able to glean an idea from to help them through the issues being faced with having to work while the kids are home.  I know it's tough to navigate these type of things.  I wish you all well and hope your situations work out.

 Dear Leaders, here's how to make a mask rule so that people stop dying, from a former school principal, just sayin... Dear Trump , Pence,  and Governors, In case you actually want  businesses to open and people to stop dying, here's a "primer" on how to make a rule that people care about and follow. If you do this, maybe we can stop watching our fellow citizens melting down at Trader Joes as thousands of our loved ones die needlessly.          

Making a rule that requires everyone to adopt a new behavior, such as wearing a mask, is possible, even in a culture that perceives the rule as an infraction of "their rights". I realize that some of you just don't give a crap about how many people are getting sick. Bust just in case, here you go...  Here's the philosophy, with  school examples:        



1) The rule must be enacted as both a "top-down" and a "grassroots" rule. **School Example:** "all students  at Roosevelt High School  must carry a pass when they travel throughout the school without an adult"                 

 The principal, the head dean, whoever is that top person, must "declare" that it is now a rule. - The teachers and staff must help to enforce it, and the students will have to buy into it. Here's the good news: it will work even if 5% of the community does not comply. This is based on the PBIS (positive behavior intervention supports) model.         

In some organizations, the leader must define the rule as "mandatory" , "legal" , or " critical"  in order to get compliance. If the leader says "encouraged" , you might as well forget the rule. **School Example:**  "Students, it is highly encouraged that you do not use your phone during class instruction."   VS. "Students, it is a mandatory, school-wide rule that you do not use your phone during instruction" . People may question, what is "mandatory" ?  They typically want to hear about the penalty of not following the rule. The good news is that the "penalty" might not need be that harsh, It might just be a big inconvenience.                   **School Example:** "Since we are having trouble following the students-must-carry-a- pass rule, we will have an assembly of all students at 2:00 Friday to review why it is important".                                                      

&amp;#x200B;

2) The leader(s) must give a rationale to everyone, to the people who dislike it the most (students) and to the people who will enforce it (staff). And the rationale must be based in data. School Example: "75% of our school disruptions come from students who leave areas without supervision, here is a graph of the last 500 discipline incidents, notice that 375 of these incidents were students who were traveling within the school without a pass, unsupervised. It is in all of our best interest to have students carry a pass that has been signed by staff."      



3) The leader(s) must be perceived by the community as following the rule themselves: School Example: If the school rule is "no wearing hats inside"  then all adults would have to refrain from wearing hats. ESPECIALLY THE PRINCIPAL .                                                                                                                                               

   4) The adherence, or following of the rule, must be continually be praised and publicly reported, along with the positive results.  School Example:   " This week I checked the hallways, and 90 out of 100 students I asked were carrying a pass. Thank you to all the teachers and students who are making a difference at Roosevelt High School."  This should include all of the other "enforcers" of the rule. "I want to thank Mr. Banks, Ms. Ramirez, and Ms. Chee as our "hallway pass superstars" of the week here at Roosevelt High School."



5) There must be a sense, perceived by all, that a continued disregard of the rule will be addressed. **School Example:** the teacher who continually ignores the rule must have a conversation with the principal, which will likely include a "verbal warning".  



6) Peer Pressure:  Eventually peer pressure must take over the "top-down" pressure. People will feel a sense of order, of fairness, of improvement, because of the collective effort of enacting the new rule. When others blatantly disregard the rule, the community will react with pressure to follow the rule .

 Possible U.S. National Quarantine/Lockdown Monday or Tuesday? I have been hearing word from some groups I am a part of that reliable sources say we may go into a lockdown the likes of what is happening in Italy right now. Does anyone else have any information or confirmation on this?

 My school found a solution Instead of closing school, like what all of the other school district around us have done. My school decided to raise the heat to the max and continue to send us to school. Meanwhile we have a student sent home because of how sick she looked and on top of everything we have mold in our vents. Please send help

 Within a week of reopening, kids at my school got corona. What will happen? So, like the title says, within a week of school reopening there are around 3-4 kids who have already gotten corona and the school has made around 30 kids quarantine.  Basically,  I am wondering if any of you have any insight as to what will happen in the future?  These kids likely spread the corona around the school already, and my guess is there will be more cases soon.  Is the school seriously just going to keep quarantining certain kids and repeat the cycle over and over until the pandemic ends?  I know it’s probably different for every school and varies depending on the area, but do you guys think school in general will last?  It seems very implausible to me.  Any insight will be greatly appreciated!

 Anyone else hear a “teacher parade” go by today? Apparently teachers nationwide organized “parades” where they drive by their students’ houses and honk a lot.  There were a lot of sirens involved too, so there must have been police participating in the parade in my town.  

Does this strike anyone else as completely asinine?  You really think none of those teachers stood around and grabbed together, before and after and probably in the middle of it at the gas station too?  Kind of defeats the purpose of a lockdown in my mind.

 Any valid news about large sex trafficking busts/ rescues going on while shelter in place is happening I keep hearing about large rings of sex trafficking have been busted and thousands of kids being saved but haven't seen any headlines or anything through legit news channels. Also it seems to tie in with something to do with shelter in place going on. I was seeing if there was any validity to this and looking for facts.
