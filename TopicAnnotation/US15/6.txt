 Reporting price gouging to end product “shortages”!! Are eBay and Amazon doing any kind of mass identifying on their end for people who are price gouging important supplies such as toilet paper and artificially creating shortages?

Until more is done, I do see that there is a Report ability for people to report individual posts. I’d encourage anyone bored at home to report report report to help end the shortage!!!

Example for toilet paper on eBay:
1. Click “Report This Item” (upper left corner on mobile)
2. Report Category: Prohibited and Restricted Items
3. Reason for Report: Price gouging
4. Detailed Reason: Sanitation Items

Any other ways for consumers to report price gouging?
