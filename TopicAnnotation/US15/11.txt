 Going back to college in the fall Hey guy, so I go to college in New York and I’m really concerned about going back. I posted on l my school page about going back and i said the following: 


Hey guys, maybe is anyone else kinda concerned about going back to 
School. I get that the school is gonna follow the CDC’s guidelines but I’m more concerned about off campus stuff. Does anyone know how Greek life is approaching Covid-19 ,or the bars, clubs, and student housing. I just don’t see a positive or neutral outcome of a couple thousand kids coming into an area beneficial. 

Also, what precautions would you recommend other than wearing a mask, religiously washing your hands and avoiding crowds?

And the only answer that I got in return to put it lightly did not inspire any type of confidence. 

This guy said something along the lines of: its not as bad as nyc. 


Idk, I’m kinda lost and looking for advice. I really dislike this type of ignorance. I’m actually in Canada right now and I love how much more civil they are about it here.

 Stimulus Check/Direct Deposit I don't have a bank account and I'm in need of the stimulus check asap. my mother is having her check direct deposited. when the website for giving the IRS and Treasury bank info comes up, can I have my check deposited in the same account as hers, or can only one check go to one account?

 Is any other country giving their citizens relief checks? The US talked about giving relief checks but it fell through. Is any other country doing anything like this?

 Stimulus check So I’m 19, I haven’t had a job since 2018 (which was my first job) and I’ve never filed taxes. Will I still get some type of check for the covid relief? I can’t seem to find a straight solid answer from anything online or anyone I ask in person.

 Can't believe I can't find this 6 months into the pandemic: Is there any source for what current covid-19 tests are available in the U.S. and what their accuracy/reliability is? I think I read there are somewhere between 70-100 different tests out there, but can't seem to find any reliable data on each of their performance history now that we have millions of tests done. If I recall, the FDA originally "approved" over 100 different tests based on very little data, as low as 60 samples? by the manufacturers in order to simply get enough tests out there. And it seems they either don't require more data about them now that they've been out there all this time, or they don't seem to make it public. 

If I further recall, the FDA did their own testing and "certified" just a couple tests originally, but I don't know which ones or how those worked out after mass deployment. 

This seems like it would be one of the most important pieces of information that should be compiled if testing is supposed to mean anything. I've generally heard tests are about 70% accurate, which is scary, but it's meaningless to someone if they're being tested and don't even know how accurate the specific test they're taking is. 

I'm probably not that good at researching this, but has anyone found any info on this? Government data, research studies, Consumer Reports-type articles, anything?

 Question I got my tax return as a check willl I receive the relief as a check or direct deposit?

 STIMULUS CHECK QUESTION So i’ve been filing my own taxes for the past 5 years. I’m also a college student but live on my own. On my tax returns, I have marked that someone can claim me as a dependent. I was unaware my parents have not claimed me as a dependent in 2018 or 2019. Will I receive a check? Will they look at my return and see I said someone could claim me or would they see that I was never claimed by anyone else and send me one? Very confused right now.

 Why did the CDC stop updating hospital capacity data on 7/14? Can we find the info somewhere else?

 Have Ulcerative Colitis and chose not to return to work. What are my next steps? Hey! Even if you don’t have an answer for me, thanks for reading! I work at a restaurant/bar/party venue that is reopening and I made the decision not to return based on my current health situation and because I’m in contact with my 95 year old grandmother.

I know you can’t receive unemployment benefits for a “general concern” of covid. But I do believe I can make an appeal with my situation at hand.

My Question:

How do I do this? Do I file a completely new claim now that my job offered me a position back? Is there a different way to file based on having a compromised immune system?

If anyone has dealt with something similar I’d love to hear advice. It is incredibly unclear through google searches what exactly I should be doing.

I live in Oregon, if that helps anyone in giving me advice
