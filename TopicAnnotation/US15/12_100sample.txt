 Side Effects We did such a good job, always wearing masks, avoided congregating with people, especially the older folks in the family. No one has gotten sick, so yay fam! 

But tonight I lost someone very dear to me, non-covid related. I spent so much time worrying that I could pass on the virus that I didn't stop to think I was missing their last good days. I regret that so so much. Maybe we can't hug everyone we want to, but make an effort to be present in the lives of those you care about, especially the elderly. You never know how much time is left. #FuckCovid

 does hand sanitizer decrease the effectiveness of KN95 masks? I always carry liquid hand sanitizer with me when I go food shopping. Either 70% alcohol or ethyl-alcohol. When I’m done I spread it over my hands and the mask I’ve been wearing. I’m worrying that the alcohol might be deteriorating the mask (I reuse masks for a little while). Should I stop rubbing the mask?

 Violent confrontations with people being asked to wear face masks    
In the last few weeks a spate of American stores have made headlines after putting up signs telling customers who wear masks they will be denied entry.   


On Thursday, [Vice reported on]( a Kentucky convenience store that [put up a sign ]( “NO Face Masks allowed in store. Lower your mask or go somewhere else. Stop listening to \[Kentucky governor Andy\] Beshear, he’s a dumbass.”   
People who trying to save life lose their life, because of a culture war. Please just get a mask to save life. If you dont know where to get one just go [here]( for God sake.

 Mask wearing needs to be all or nothing, otherwise we are wasting them I see that a lot of people are starting to wear masks, but I can’t help but feel they are wasting them, hear me out:

Masks (non n95 as I see most people are wearing) are very effective for not spreading if you are a carrier (asymptomatic included) but they do not prevent you from getting exposed if someone infected coughs on/near you.

If everyone wears masks then we can stop the spread, but as most people cannot buy any due to supply issue this isn’t possible.

So now we have this situation where people wearing masks are still getting exposed to the virus due to infected people not having masks. 

At this point would it be more effective for people that currently have masks to hold off wearing it until the production catches up? Otherwise we will be stuck in this cycle where masks are getting disposed while productions are trying to catch up. 

At that point everyone can wear masks and we stop the spread way more effectively.

Obviously this is never going to happen but with the amount of people not wearing masks, your best bet is not going outside as your mask won’t save you at all.

 People who don't wear masks... My good friend has it, he has been bleeding, Constant pain and coughing blood.  
Please, wear your masks, Wash your hands as much as you can. And be safe and if you wanna go out with your friends, stay inside for 2 fucking weeks at least. Because this shit's not a joke, and if people don't wear masks in a Walmart. He can't breath or laugh properly. Please wear your masks, wash your hands 100% of the time, and please fucking wear your masks.

 Why do cases keep rising if people are wearing masks? When I go out in public, I wear a mask and I see many people doing the same. I don't wear the mask when I'm outside, I only wear it when I'm inside a building. Since masks are effective, I don't see why schools can't reopen or why we would need to shut down.

 I have many masks and surgical masks. Who should I contact? Hello everyone! 

I'm Chinese. We are a mask factory in China. We really hope our products can help you. We have a large number of disposable masks and surgical masks. I learned from my friends that there is a shortage of masks in many parts of the world.

We now have 200,000 disposable and surgical masks.

Medical surgical mask, bfe &gt; = 95%, conforms to Chinese yy0469-2011 medical mask standard, yy0469-2011 is very similar to FFP2.

But I'm not sure who I should contact. If you need a lot, please contact me. My email address is 2160210880@qq.com

 I DO NOT WANT TO WEAR A MASK!   

**A Compromise.** 

I **100%** HATE wearing masks! I hate the way it feels on my face, I hate how it occasionally fogs up my glasses and I absolutely hate breathing in the warmth of the air I so recently exhaled. For reference, I have the homemade kind my mom made and shipped to me. And like I said I 100% am not a fan of wearing it! 

Here in America, one side wanted the economy reopened and does not want to have to wear masks when they go out shopping. The other side wants to stay closed until we have a handle on this virus, and wants the reassurance that when they do HAVE to go out, they are protected (or as protected as they can be) from others who may be sick. 

So what do we do?! We compromise! (For those of you who may have forgotten, a compromise is where nobody gets everything they want, but everyone gets something they want.) We compromise because that’s what adults do! We understand that there are other people in this country who may want something besides what we want. There are people who want guns, and some who don’t. Some people want marijuana to be legalized, and others who don’t want it legalized. There are millions of things where people are of opposing minds. 

America is now slowly reopening, but the stipulation, THE COMPROMISE, is that when we are asked to wear masks in a store, we do so. Not every store will require you to wear a mask but when they do, remember that you are standing inside a business that just a few days ago was closed. This is what you wanted! Why is that not good enough?! Why must you resort to violence or immature name calling? Why do you have to be rude or mean to the clerk or even business manager who is not making the decision if their store will require masks be worn? Why can’t you just compromise and wear the itchy, annoying, pain in the butt mask, to keep the peace and potentially keep the high risk store clerk, that you demanded come back to work, safe? I hate it too! But, I will do it without question because it’s the compromise made so I can go get my haircut!

 Grocery store- no mask question Hey guys quick question. Today was in NY area and went into a supermarket wearing a mask myself. Unfortunately during the time as I was there there was a couple of people not wearing a mask. One of which I passed by as I entered the store as he was leaving, and another made my sandwich, but was obviously distanced from him as he was behind the counter. Should I be concerned? Maybe unnecessarily worried but don’t want to get sick here, would appreciate any opinions here. Like I said, I myself was wearing a mask

 You should wear a mask when you go out I am a teenager and I have to carry 15 kg on my back every weekend while it's a hot and I have to wear a gas mask and walk 3 km back and forth, the gas mask is extremely uncomfortable and makes it hard to breathe in, but I still pull through and finish the job. So if I can do all that then you can wear a simple face mask just to go out, you're not gonna admit defeat to a teenager are you? Please wear a face mask when you leave your house, it's not that hard to do.

 How long before high profile people finally start wearing masks and subsequently sell advertising space on their face? It curious to think about all these high profile people such as politicians and certain celebrities who don't otherwise wear masks. Do you think they may end up inevitably wearing masks to save their careers? If they end up finally wearing a mask do you think advertising space on their face would happen even further down the line?

PSA: This is not intended to discuss political parties, candidates and/or their ideals unrelated to mask wearing. Just politicians in *GENERAL* that currently aren't and/or refuse to wear masks. Thank you!

 Mandatory mask wearing compared to mandatory Speed Limits  

Saying "I have my rights, even though the mandate says "wear a mask", I can't wear a mask" is the equivalent of saying "I have my rights, even though the mandated speed limit says 55 mph, I can drive 90 if I want".

Literally every part of the Mask argument can be correlated with the speed limit argument.

"I can't wear a mask, I have a "health issue" ", is the same as saying "I can't drive at the speed limit, my eyesight is bad, and I can't see the sign." The speeder with bad eyesight would get pulled over and get his driver's license revoked or at the bare minimum receive a ticket because he/she could hurt themself or others. In the same way, the person with the supposed "health condition" would be hurting themself and/or others, and should be fined because of that.

"Masks should be a personal choice, not a government requirement" is the same as saying "How fast you want to go on the road should be a personal choice." Of course most people would say that you shouldn't be able to go 120 mph down the freeway, as you might hurt someone. The same thing applies to masks. People shouldn't be allowed to not wear masks, as they might hurt someone.

"Masks probably don't work anyways, why should I wear them" is the same as saying "Speed limits probably don't work anyways, why should I follow them". In 1973 Congress passed a law that lowered the federal speed limit to 55. In 1995, it got repealed, and since then there has been an extra 12,545 deaths (link: [ ) due to the higher speed limits. If everyone would just wear a mask, there would be less deaths, the same as if everyone just followed the speed limit.

"Only sick people need masks" is the same thing as "Only those who speed a lot need speed limits" . You might be the best social distancer around, but you might cough or sneeze by accident, and there is no telling if you're an asymptomatic carrier of COVID-19, and a mask would prevent or at least hamper transmission of the virus. Same with speeding. You might be distracted at the wheel, and that speedometer might go up to 90 mph cause you leaned in on the acceleration pedal. But just because that was your first speeding violation doesn't give you a right to just opt out of following the rules.

This list could go on and on, but whenever an Anti-masker tries to argue with you about wearing masks, just bring up speed limits and compare masks with that.

Hope I helped someone's argument, or at least gave you a good read.

 The perplexing non-mask wearers... I saw an interview with people in Italy who asked,  “Don’t the Americans care about their health?” The Italians  were referring  to Americans rebelling against wearing masks.  Personally , I do not LIKE wearing masks, but I wear them because science says they keep us safer/healthier.  So, I put on the mask faithfully, especially before I walk into a store.  Yet despite the signs plastered all over stores’ doors and walls, I’m still seeing people with their noses uncovered, with masks flapping under their chins, with masks that make no sense whatsoever (Halloween masks, face shields without masks underneath, and today—not sure what it was, a little tiny square of plastic   half the size of a credit card, suspended in front of someone’s mouth). Of course, the worst is people with no masks at all.  So I ask you—how do you feel about similar situations you’ve encountered, and what if anything do you do about  it?

 Store Policy - Safety or Scamming (or maybe Gouging) This was a few days ago but I'm still thinking about it so I thought I'd get some opinions.  Also if it doesn't belong here feel free to remove or move to another forum.  Let me first say I completely understand the need for masks, distancing, store occupancy limits and the rest and I follow it.  Also currently in my state you have to wear masks in stores and other buildings but not outside yet; we can and do it's just not required.

But we do run out of things so sometimes you have to go out and get necessary items which is what we were dong when this happened.  One of us stood in the grocery store line (they were doing a one out/one in count) and I went to a smaller store in the same strip hoping to find a few things I knew the grocery store wouldn't have.  But as soon as I walked in the cashier called out to me that gloves are required to shop in the store.  I said ooops, sorry I don't have any.   The cashier said no problem we have these for sale.  He pulled a pack out of this HUGE box he had right up at the register and waved it at me.  They weren't medical or special they were actually single wrapped versions of those gloves you use to do the dishes. For $5 each.  I turned around and left.  I figured I could come back another day and to be honest if I had an extra $5 to spend at that moment it wouldn't be on cheap dish gloves.

Now remember, masks are required by law but there's nothing about gloves or other protection.  Also PPE is hard to come by now, not everyone has gloves or they're trying to use them sparingly so they don't run out.  And while we can make masks out of just about anything you can't make your own gloves.  I guess if you knew about the policy in advance you could use winter or driving gloves if you had to.  And, of course, stores are free to make stricter policies then the law requires if they think it's needed.  But I started to feel like maybe the store wasn't doing this to be extra safe.....The idea that they and only they would require gloves (haven't found another store requiring this yet) and that they just happen to sell gloves in the store and just happen to have a big stock of them with a nice big box full ready to sell to you, and that they're charging more than double the usual price for that product - The more I've thought about that the past few days the more annoyed I feel that they're just taking advantage.  So I wonder does this sound to you like a good store policy designed to keep us extra safe or an excuse for the store to do a little money grab?

 You don’t need permission to wear a mask! Why exactly are there so many posts about wearing masks?! Is it the societal validation? I don’t understand. It’s not illegal to wear a mask or face covering! If I was lucky enough to have one of those legit consumer surgical care masks (like you get from the drugstore/grocery store) you bet I would be wearing one! Just do it. But if you are, wear them CORRECTLY. Nothing more irritating than seeing an ignoramus not wearing them or using them appropriately!! 

PS: I HOPE that these mask manufacturers will get to the point where they can redirect some of their shipments back to the stores for consumers or Amazon gets them back in stock soon so we can all have those nice surgical quality ones. But for now I’ll settle for a bandanna and common sense! I think anything is better than nothing at this point!!

 Dear Leaders, here's how to make a mask rule so that people stop dying, from a former school principal, just sayin... Dear Trump , Pence,  and Governors, In case you actually want  businesses to open and people to stop dying, here's a "primer" on how to make a rule that people care about and follow. If you do this, maybe we can stop watching our fellow citizens melting down at Trader Joes as thousands of our loved ones die needlessly.          

Making a rule that requires everyone to adopt a new behavior, such as wearing a mask, is possible, even in a culture that perceives the rule as an infraction of "their rights". I realize that some of you just don't give a crap about how many people are getting sick. Bust just in case, here you go...  Here's the philosophy, with  school examples:        



1) The rule must be enacted as both a "top-down" and a "grassroots" rule. **School Example:** "all students  at Roosevelt High School  must carry a pass when they travel throughout the school without an adult"                 

 The principal, the head dean, whoever is that top person, must "declare" that it is now a rule. - The teachers and staff must help to enforce it, and the students will have to buy into it. Here's the good news: it will work even if 5% of the community does not comply. This is based on the PBIS (positive behavior intervention supports) model.         

In some organizations, the leader must define the rule as "mandatory" , "legal" , or " critical"  in order to get compliance. If the leader says "encouraged" , you might as well forget the rule. **School Example:**  "Students, it is highly encouraged that you do not use your phone during class instruction."   VS. "Students, it is a mandatory, school-wide rule that you do not use your phone during instruction" . People may question, what is "mandatory" ?  They typically want to hear about the penalty of not following the rule. The good news is that the "penalty" might not need be that harsh, It might just be a big inconvenience.                   **School Example:** "Since we are having trouble following the students-must-carry-a- pass rule, we will have an assembly of all students at 2:00 Friday to review why it is important".                                                      

&amp;#x200B;

2) The leader(s) must give a rationale to everyone, to the people who dislike it the most (students) and to the people who will enforce it (staff). And the rationale must be based in data. School Example: "75% of our school disruptions come from students who leave areas without supervision, here is a graph of the last 500 discipline incidents, notice that 375 of these incidents were students who were traveling within the school without a pass, unsupervised. It is in all of our best interest to have students carry a pass that has been signed by staff."      



3) The leader(s) must be perceived by the community as following the rule themselves: School Example: If the school rule is "no wearing hats inside"  then all adults would have to refrain from wearing hats. ESPECIALLY THE PRINCIPAL .                                                                                                                                               

   4) The adherence, or following of the rule, must be continually be praised and publicly reported, along with the positive results.  School Example:   " This week I checked the hallways, and 90 out of 100 students I asked were carrying a pass. Thank you to all the teachers and students who are making a difference at Roosevelt High School."  This should include all of the other "enforcers" of the rule. "I want to thank Mr. Banks, Ms. Ramirez, and Ms. Chee as our "hallway pass superstars" of the week here at Roosevelt High School."



5) There must be a sense, perceived by all, that a continued disregard of the rule will be addressed. **School Example:** the teacher who continually ignores the rule must have a conversation with the principal, which will likely include a "verbal warning".  



6) Peer Pressure:  Eventually peer pressure must take over the "top-down" pressure. People will feel a sense of order, of fairness, of improvement, because of the collective effort of enacting the new rule. When others blatantly disregard the rule, the community will react with pressure to follow the rule .

 The issue of COVID-19 in the US. Ok, before this I will say I am only 14 so I might not mean a lot to many people. But the situation in the Continental US won’t get any better unless people except the fact that mask are by far the best method we have to stop the spread of COVID. Because no, states creating laws making it mandatory to wear mask in public isn’t denying us of our rights, it is something here to keep us safe. The government isn’t trying to strip the people’s power away. They are trying to get us past this so all you Karen’s can go watch little Johnny play hood little league soccer. They are trying to save lives. Now believe me if you have a better idea that’ll save us, I am all ears. But if not; shut up, and wear a mask for maybe an hour a day. And for sure, don’t complain about it!! You would never complain about having to wear a seatbelt. Which mind you; is a law, in place to protect people’s lives!! So if you believe that it’s fine, then wearing a mask is fine, and won’t take you’re rights as an American citizen. I have to wear a a mask at least 4 hours a day and I haven’t complained in the slightest. So it annoys me when I hear people whining like children over this. It’s people like you that make other countries pity us. And this is ironic; MEXICO HAS SHUT DOWN ITS AMERICAN BORDER BECAUSE OF HOW BADLY AMERICA IS DOING. And the big reason we are doing bad, the big reason there are nearly 150 thousand deaths, are because people won’t put a piece if paper on their face. Sorry if this came out as a bit to aggressive. But something needs to change. I saw a group of 50 people in a 10*10 foot area; none of them had a mask. There’s a good amount of kids in Marching Band who don’t wear mask and get close to people. There are still protests going on where I believe people aren’t wearing mask where there are sometimes hundreds of other people. So please if you read this, and you aren’t wearing a mask; I am begging you to for the sake of everyone around you, wear a mask. And if you do wear a mask, and you know people who don’t, try swaying their mind into wearing one, or go throughout social media and spread the word. Because even if it’s mandatory to wear a mask; everyone knows people won’t. Or they’ll protest against the law being made. Just please, heed my advice. As I’ve said; I know I’m only 14, but I’m genuinely worried. All I’ve seen on News stations are constant news about everything bad going on. And if I can help make one of those issues a bit better. That’s all I want.

 Wear masks or cover your mouth at least. I have noticed something here.
All the countries abundant with masks are suggesting to wear masks.
Italians are starting to wear masks. If you watch recent videos, important people in Italy are wearing masks.

Doctors and nurses must wear masks to protect themselves.
For us, in America, we dont have enough masks, not even for medical professionals.

If we had more masks, the government would have suggested to wear masks!

Check our your local markets. Dont trust them saying that wearing mask doesnt do anything. It is better than nothing.

Wearing a mask is not a cultural thing.
We are just told not to wear them because we dont have enough. 

So, my suggest is just use anything that could be used as a mask.

 I see so many people not wearing masks!! :( Why is it that as the numbers of corona cases go up it seems like less and less people are wearing masks? My 10 year old child the other day was asking me do I really need to wear a mask and it kind of shook me... What should I tell my kids?   


Even I don't really know which mask to get and why I need to be wearing one if everyone around me is not wearing one. Does't wearing masks really help us if everyone else is just saying yolo? Also if everyone is not going to wear a mask then which mask should I get for my family and kids so that I can safely protect my family? Thank you for the advice in advance...

 why not wearing masks?   

I don’t really know why not wearing a mask in US?

Reason 1: experts say “if you’re healthy, you don’t need to wear a mask”

But in Taiwan, they contain virus pretty well. 

The only difference between US and Taiwan is wearing masks.

You maybe say Taiwan is island so it’s easy to isolate virus from the outside of their border.

But US is also a BIG ISLAND from china.

You maybe say Taiwan's medical environment is good enough to take care of and manage patients,

But Europe’s is also good enough at the early stage. 

 

Reason 2: shortage of masks

but there are other substitute materials to make homemade masks. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wonder to know what are the reasons of not wearing masks in US?
++++++++++
 Please forgive my dumb question but I just want to be clear -- are masks to be worn mainly to stop you from getting the virus or from transmitting it to someone else? Or does wearing a mask have effectiveness for BOTH purposes? I think many mask wearers wear them with the hope of not getting the virus.  But I also hear they should be worn to stop them from transmitting the virus from themselves to others.

 Please Stop Mask Shaming in the US! #Masks4All #NormalizeMasks Yesterday I went to my doctor (medical group facility) for a routine birth control shot. My doctor didn't cancel the appointment and since I take it to help with PCOS symptoms, I didn't want to cancel either. However, knowing there could be elderly and/or immocompromised people there, I wore a (surgical, not N95) mask since I have been in public contact in the last two weeks. 

As soon as I walked in, the whole reception station gave me looks, one even snickered. I walked up to check in and the receptionist immediately asks "are you having symptoms?" (Which was not asked of the person before me) I said "no, but I have had public contact and know I could be an asymptomatic carrier, I am being proactive."

She tells me to take a seat and comes out a few min later saying they will come out to my car for my injection. I was like WTF?! I am doing more than the other people in the office touching their face and then the chairs and counters but yet I'M being shamed for wearing a mask and being proactive?!

After sitting in my car annoyed for about 15 min, the nurse comes out in full protective gear... face shield, gown and all. It was embarrassing and I feel bad that they wasted PPE on someone just trying to be proactive. Especially when the dumbass who comes to their appointment after shopping walmart and target because they were "bored" is touching the office's counters and chairs. THAT'S the person they should be worried about! 

Luckily, the nurses who came out apologized and were very sympathetic. They actually thanked me for being proactive and said they wish more people were.

I was going to do my weekly grocery run right after so I didnt have to "decontaminate" twice this week but I felt so defeated for doing the right thing that I just came home. 

So please people, don't shame anyone for wearing masks, we are doing it to help YOU! You can find homemade masks on etsy or paper masks on amazon if you are interested in wearing one but don't want to take supplies from medical personnel. I bought ONE box of surgical masks as I saw this coming in January, please dont shame me for being prepared, I am not a hoarder. 

Also, to the mask naysayers, go read ABC News latest story where Dr. Fauci says they are in talks to make masks mandatory in the US.

 Stop telling me to wear a mask. I don't care if you die of corona. You won't tell me what to wear and what the fuck to do with my life. And I don't care if the news said that 1000, 10,000 or 100,000 people died in the last 50, 20, or 3 days. Your news obsession doesn't concern me. Stop refusing me antry to the supermarket and the post office. I will not wear a mask. I don't like wearing it and I don't mind dying from corona, nor do I mind you dying from it.

 Can anyone give me some perspective on what "religious beliefs" could prohibit people from wearing masks? I recently came across some news articles about an anti-mask group "The Freedom to Breathe Agency" whose founders claim that they have religious beliefs that exempt them from wearing masks, which I thought was odd. Today I find out my mother is working the polls in CT and not ONE other employee is wearing a mask, and a few have cited religious beliefs as their reason not to. I am not religious myself but I grew up in Christianity so I have good familiarity with a few of the larger sects and I cant think of any argument that could be made on a religious basis for not wearing a mask. I'm confused and very worried about my mom being in such a high exposure environment. Can anyone help me understand how someone could argue their religious beliefs don't allow them to wear a mask?

 Hoarders Please stop blaming the lack of masks on "hoarders".  Hospitals do not buy N95 masks from Walmart or CVS. They buy them in bulk.  The problem is not that I bought a box of masks two months ago because I was caring for a sick family member.  The problem is hospitals relying on a steady stream of product and when the need for that product skyrockets or there is a distribution problem, they can no longer get the supply they need.  

3M produces 100M N95 masks a month. Prestige Ameritech produces 1M surgical masks a day.  The problem isn't my 6 masks or your 6 masks, it's that only 10% of the US need for masks is actually made in the US and now that there is a global pandemic, countries that make masks have banned their export.

If anyone is "hoarding" masks, it is the federal government that has millions of them in stock but refuses to release them to the states.  Some businesses may have stockpiled masks months ago for their own purposes and many of them are now transferring those stocks to hospitals.  So again, please stop demonizing regular folks from protecting themselves and their loved ones by wearing a mask to stop the spread of this disease.

 Are there exemptions from mandatory mask orders? Hi, I work at a fast food restaurant in a state which has recently started a mandatory mask order. People frequently come in without masks and when I tell them they need a mask to eat inside they say that they have a condition and can't wear a mask, when I ask for them what the condition is or for some proof they say that it is illegal to ask. I've been telling them to leave but I'm really not too sure on the issue. Am I in the wrong here?(I'm in Kansas if that matters)

 Wear a damn mask.      My dad always says that rules/laws are for the people who break them. 

     The director of the CDC claims we could have this virus under control in weeks in America if the people simply followed their guidelines. This means wearing a mask, but apparently for anti-maskers nothing that simple can be practiced.

     I’m tired of the “I’m in a free country so I’m not wearing a mask” BS. Yes, you are in a free country, and you do have the right to not wear one, however, be ready for the repercussions. Just like YES, you are in a free country, you can kill/shoplift/deal drugs if you so choose. But guess what, now you have to deal with the consequences of your actions. It’s how breaking the law in a free country works. 

     If a store has a policy where they require their staff and customers to wear masks, wear a damn mask. They have always had the right to have these policies in place refuse service to anyone no questions asked. They could require you to wear a hula skirt and a straw hat if they fucking wanted to and you would have to comply. 

     I am not a ‘sheep’ for wearing a mask. You think this virus is a hoax? Cool, your belief, but my belief is that it is very real so I’m wearing a mask, don’t preach to me and try to take it off my face. Some hoax really, considering the entire planet is in on this ‘prank’. 

     The reason this virus is still rampant in America is because of people like this. Americans are all about ME ME ME and do not give a fuck about anyone else, even in a PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. These people need to get their heads out of their own asses and realize that pandemics are a real thing. And that the consequences of their own actions are a real thing. 

   Wear a damn mask.

 Social Stigma of Mask Perhaps the reason why the US government is telling healthy people not to wear mask is to avoid panic. If people see others wearing mask and find out they can’t buy it anymore, the level of panic will increase. Mass panic could prove to be much worse than the disease itself. Wearing mask does not always mean you are sick or a signal for other people to stay 10 feet away from you. On the other side of the globe, healthy people are wearing mask daily when they go out. Perhaps it’s time for the Western culture to drop the dumb stigma of wearing a mask.

Still, is spreading misinformation really the way? Why are civilians being shamed for buying mask? We have the right to protect ourselves. Why do they have to say mask is useless for healthy people? It is a dangerous statement coming out from the government. In China, anyone who does not wear a mask will be arrested. Mask does work, different types of mask means different level of protection. What if the person is asymptomatic aka he/she is a carrier but has not develop symptoms yet? Can we really trust sick people to wear mask? They don’t even know how to cover their cough/sneeze properly. They are also probably afraid of being called weird for wearing a mask.

Ask yourself, why do you wear a seatbelt? Because you never know what’s going to happen, you may be able to trust yourself but you are not the only person. There are others out there, others with lack of responsibility and care for other people.

They are saying that there is not enough mask for the front liner workers, so civilians should not be hoarding it. Well, it’s not like they had almost 2 months to prepare.. Oh wait, they did. For whatever reasons of why they were not being proactive, please don’t blame the civilians for the government’s lack of preparation.

It’s easy to point fingers at other people/country. US is by no means the worst, but yet they are far from the best.There are so many questionable things that the US government does regarding the disease. From the lack of airport closures, lack of airport security health check, faulty test kits, extremely strict rules in order to qualify for testing, patients literally turned away from testing, doctors and hospitals prohibited to do testings, etc.

A wise person once said, “If you are confused of why certain actions are being made, find the answer by following where the $ is.”

Damn right.

Argument:

[Even if there are cases next door, the answer is no, you do NOT need to get or wear any face masks—surgical masks, “N95 masks,” respirator masks, or anything else—to protect yourself against the coronavirus. Not only do you not need them, you shouldn’t wear them](
