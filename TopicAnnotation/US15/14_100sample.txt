 is my friend lying about his covid test results? my friend told me he got tested on august 3 (10 days ago) using at at-home diagnostic test in the united states, using a prescription from his doctor. 

he told me he heard back from the lab on august 5 that he was negative. 

we went bike riding together on august 9. 

the next day on august 10, he told me that his doctor just called him about his positive covid test--so presumably the lab ran the test twice, and the first time it was negative but then when they tested his sample again 24 hours later (?! is this normal?), it came out positive. and somehow, they only told his doctor and forgot to alert him.

this seems inane, but also the US was so far behind in testing that it's kind of believable. does anyone know what the protocol is for testing here? do they test samples twice and is this possible -- or is he lying to me? thanks!

 Roommate Virus Well, my roommate just went and got tested for the virus..... Its got me pretty freaked out, but honestly I want to believe that the test is going to come back negative. When she went to the doctor they told her that she has two ear infections and still tested her. She won't get the results back for a few days, and I don't know what to do for myself. She has been crying ever since she got back from the doctor saying that she has all the symptoms, but I know that we don't own a thermometer so there is no way that she can claim that she's had a fever for the past few days. She's been feeling well enough to drink half a bottle of vodka every night. So now she is in quarantine and cannot leave the house until the results come back..... I feel fine, but I feel obligated to stay home also..... Her emotions are going crazy, she's freaking out about absolutely everything and it is really hard to be around that right now. I tried telling her to go rest and not to stress out because its only going to make it harder for her body to heal. But she won't listen to me... she's crying and screaming about being sick and bad friends and money and anything bad thats ever happened to her. I feel like I am trapped in hell.

 Our Experience with Coronavirus : What its like to have Covid and also have Herpes. Our Daily Log.   Recent Covid positive &amp; HSV2 positive here. My wife and I both are existing HSV2 patients. She is HSV2 and I am HSV1/2. We  have both been prescribed acyclovir many years ago be taken on an as needed basis. Acyclovir is an anti-viral for herpes that we have been prescribed in the past and ZPack is a common antibiotic Azithromax.These are our observations ONLY and this is NOT medical advice in any way. Be well:

Some key takeaways we have observed:

1) There is some overlap of symptoms between HSV2 and Covid

2) Acyclovir had an effect on us for the better. Perhaps warrants future research? 

3) Read meat and Alcohol exacerbate our symptoms. 

Background:

Age: me: 45 M 180lb / her: 50F 5'4" 145b

BMI: Normal / No major illnesses / No Comorbidity / Gym 2X per week / I Surf allot / We work office

Pre Existing: Me: HSV1 and HSV2 positive, former smoker 10 yrs ago, Her: HSV2 positive

Starting 8/6 we were **confirmed to be Covid positive**, we contracted illness 8/3. Current symptoms range from slight fever, coughs, clogged sinus to sore throat.

Beginning 8/7 we began taking our acyclovir, as the sinus pressure and headaches associated with Covid are very similar to an HSV2 break out. If we didn't know we had Covid we would assume this was either HSV2 outbreak or a middle ear infection. This is not medical advice. Be well:

Praying we are on the downswing of this.

**DIET is SO important!!** Don’t believe the BS: Food and Vitamins are a HUGE influence on how your body deals with this illness!!! You ARE what you eat!!!

If you are Obese, this should be a wake up call: GET FIT.

Also: DONT watch the news: it only makes you feel worse. Go out for a walk and get some light exercise!!!

 Should I be tested So to set the scene I am 16 years old and work at Publix as a bagger for those of you who don't know what that is it's a grocery store and since the whole coronavirus freakout I've been on the front line trying to stay safe and healthy but about 2 days ago I developed a cough nothing big just a normal cough that I didn't think much about fast forward to the next day that morning I had a low grade fever still with just a little cough and now a sore throat and a runny nose I still didn't think much of it and continued to work for the day because it was a pretty short shift about halfway through my shift I felt like I couldn't continue and told me boss I wasn't feeling well and I needed to go home once home I went to sleep and woke up with the same symptoms plus just feeling miserable with body aches the next day (today) I got my fever down with some medicine but its come back up to a 100.6 I've been tested 3 times for the flu and 1 time for strep throat so my question is should I be tested and is it worth it to get tested being the price and all 
Edit: I have no underlying health conditions besides skin cancer which I don't believe will cause the disease to effect me any differently

 Stop Downplaying the Virus. Don't panic but take it little bit seriously The thing about this virus is young people might not suffer the same fate as old people and people with compromised immune system. 

But if we keep on travelling here and there, we are gonna get the virus and we will be the medium of transfer of virus. We might eventually heal at some point but other's might not. 

Please stop taking this thing lightly. 
Avoid gatherings, travel and take care of yourself and others.

If you think you have a symptom, try to quarantine yourself.

this coronavirus pandemic is kicking our ass and we really need to do something about it and looks like the usa is not doing jack shit about it people are still going stories and restaurants and nobody is social distancing.but people need to start social distancing and stop going to fucking restaurants and bars.what people really need to do is to take some time off work and start social distancing.

it,s starting to anger me that their starting reopen the economy and their think about reopening stadiums thats fucking dumb if people go to stadiums then there will be a spike in coronavirus cases.lockdowns really do work guys in fact many countries have done it and it works.But i have an idea to slow down coronavirus cases.

step 1"tell your boss that you need some time off

step 2"take the day off

step 3"stay at home all time and pack up on groceries

step 4"keep staying at home and don,t go outside and don,t go to restaurants and bars and please don,t go to a fucking stadium and aslo don,t bring friends over in your house too.

 When this is all over, remember that the situation could have been a lot better had this corrupt administration acted 3 months ago in Jan. Calling a deadly pandemic a hoax, trivializing the virus, delaying testing for months, are just a few of the overall incompetence this administration has shown. And don't get fooled one bit by these shameless POS, they don't care about the most essential workers out there putting their lives on the line to keep the country running. They don't care about raising minimum wage, providing health benefits for the poor, adequately compensating workers who've lost their jobs. While essential workers were putting their lives on the line, these shitbags were busy profiting from insider trading selling millions in stocks.

Don't forget once this is all over, vote these fuckers out.

 For anyone having symptoms, anyone who was positive for COVID-19. I have been rejecting friend invites to hang out and trying to stay in unless I need to get groceries. I sanitize and wipe my hands with Lysol wipes every time I touch something out in public. However... I am still freaking out. I had to meet up with one of my friends and my other friend was there. She was in Long Beach, CA last weekend, also one of those people who are not taking this virus seriously. Hearing that Long Beach has a few cases, I panicked. Also, I got gas these few days and did not use something to touch the pump, but would just wipe with Lysol and sanitize immediately right after. 

These past few days I have had a slight sore throat. Stuffy nose (more on one side). Today I checked my temperature and it was a consistent one going from 88.6-99.4. Now my ears are a little itchy (I think from my scratchy throat). Need to take deep breaths sometimes but I feel like it might be anxiety because the moment I do take those breaths, I feel better. Besides that, I have no cough... no fatigue. Should I be worried? I have a 2 year old and my husband, so I’m a little freaked out. Any advice?
