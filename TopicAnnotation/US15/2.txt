 Proposed Name Change It would be better and clearer to change the name of this sub and stop referring to the current epidemic as being caused by "coronavirus."  There are LOTS of corona viruses and there have been a number of outbreaks of sickness due to these various corona viruses.

A better name for this particular corona virus is **Wuhan virus**, which accurately describes the source of this particular virus and the illness which it is causing.

 Please stop buying up all the water I unfortunately live in my car, and have been in this situation for quite a while. Typically, I buy 1 gallon jugs of water in combination with public water from my college and public library. Both the library and my college are closed. Now I pretty much have to rely on the bottled water. However, people are buying all of them up, and I'm forced to ration my water intake.

So please use your tap water, as I can't. Boil it if you're that afraid.

 Why are people spending relief and unemployment money on drugs and extravagant dinners? Excuse me, folks. 

But every time I go on my Instagram I see my unemployed friends spending government money on drinks, drugs, clothes and restaurants. 

One of them is in Florida and went right over to the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino and also bought ketamine. 

A girl I know in New York spent her money on a trip to the beach with her friends and used it to buy pot and wine bottles. 

Then there was the story earlier this week about the man in Miami who spent his PPP loans on a lambhorghini and extravagant dinners for women he met on dating sites. 

Im really surprised at the insane idiocy of these people. Not so much because they are doing this during a pandemic but because they are acting like they have such an extravagant lifestyle but are really just mooching off the government. 

Am I the only one witnessing this?

 One of my friends said that people shouldn‚Äôt let the virus stop them from doing what they enjoy. What‚Äôs your thoughts on what he say? Honestly I do kind of agree with him, instead of staying indoors and let the virus stop what you want to do you should go outside and enjoy like go for a run, play basketball at the park, but obviously avoid to crowded places and touching stuff. Now if I said that to someone they would be like ‚ÄúSo your fine with getting the virus and being in quarantine‚Äù? No, we‚Äôre obviously aware of the virus and even if our chances of getting the virus increases we know that we‚Äôre enjoying life and not letting this virus get in the way. But we‚Äôre obvious still cautious about everything and go out with more care because there‚Äôs elderly around and there more immune to COVID-19. He also brought up that at the end of the day he‚Äôs living life and not letting the virus ruin his break and part of his life. Pretty much if this virus gets to him he knows that he spent his days enjoying life instead of trying to survive.

Obviously if someone has elders at home they should stay inside.

What‚Äôs your thoughts?

 Tips for when shopping during this time! 1. Buy what you think you would need to last you 1-2 months. 
2. DO NOT BUY OUT AN ENTIRE STORE 
3. Check online to see if nearby stores have what you're looking for and then call to confirm cause sometimes it takes the system a long time to update online.
4. Try to buy in store not online if you can and feel it's safe as some people live in rural places and they do most of their ordering online.
5. USE COMMON SENSE
6. Buy food stored in cans, you can buy frozen/fridge foods too but remember, if power goes out, the food will go bad unless you have or are planning to buy a generator
7. Do shopping for your entire family if you can, minimize the amount of people inside a store
8. Buy water. Juices and soda isn't a priority. 
9. Buy a water purifier/filter. They are fairly cheap and you can use to refill bottles of water
10. Keep your distance and stay safe!

 NOVID - Anonymous COVID Contact Tracing App Here‚Äôs the info I found (and what makes it sick):

[NOVID]( is the first and only completely anonymous COVID-19 contact-tracing app published in the USA that uses no personal information. Founded by Carnegie Mellon professor Dr. Po-Shen Loh, [NOVID]( uses bluetooth and ultrasound to monitor your distance from and time spent around other users to completely anonymously warn you in advance if you are exposed to the virus.

The app has a "[Community]( feature, which will allow the area‚Äôs administration to section out areas to procure COVID-19 data, such as interactions and cases, that happen in the area, all while maintaining the anonymity of the people. With this, the administration can constantly monitor the trajectory of the virus and take decisions for the school‚Äôs safety accordingly.

 Good tips for Daily living in the pandemic GENERAL GOOD ADVICE FOR MY FELLOW GEORGIANS


* The virus is not a living organism, but a protein molecule covered by a protective layer of lipid, which, when absorbed by the cells of the ocular, nasal or buccal mucosa, changes their genetic code. (mutation) and convert them into aggressor and multiplier cells.
 
* Since the virus is not a living organism but a protein molecule, it is not killed, but decays on its own. The disintegration time depends on the temperature, humidity and type of material where it lies.
 
* The virus is very fragile; the only thing that protects it is a thin outer layer of fat. That is why any soap or detergent is the best remedy, because the foam CUTS the FAT (that is why you have to rub so much: for 20 seconds or more, to make a lot of foam).
 
By dissolving the fat layer, the protein molecule disperses and breaks down on its own.
 
* HEAT melts fat; this is why it is so good to use water above 25 degrees Celsius for washing hands, clothes and everything. In addition, hot water makes more foam and that makes it even more useful.
 
* Alcohol or any mixture with alcohol over 65% DISSOLVES ANY FAT, especially the external lipid layer of the virus.
 
* Any mix with 1 part bleach and 5 parts water directly dissolves the protein, breaks it down from the inside.
 
* Oxygenated water helps long after soap, alcohol and chlorine, because peroxide dissolves the virus protein, but you have to use it pure and it hurts your skin.
 
* NO BACTERICIDE OR ANTIBIOTIC SERVES. The virus is not a living organism like bacteria; antibodies cannot kill what is not alive.
 
* NEVER shake used or unused clothing, sheets or cloth. While it is glued to a porous surface, it is very inert and disintegrates only
-between 3 hours (fabric and porous),
-4 hours (copper and wood)
-24 hours (cardboard),
- 42 hours (metal) and
-72 hours (plastic).
 
But if you shake it or use a feather duster, the virus molecules float in the air for up to 3 hours, and can lodge in your nose.
 
* The virus molecules remain very stable in external cold, or artificial as air conditioners in houses and cars.
 
They also need moisture to stay stable, and especially darkness. Therefore, dehumidified, dry, warm and bright environments will degrade it faster.
 
* Stanford University Researchers have discovered that exposing contaminated mask to heat for duration sanitizes them. N95 respirators have been successfully cleaned by baking them at 158F¬∞ for 30 minutes 
 
* The virus CANNOT go through healthy skin.
 
* Vinegar is NOT useful because it does not break down the protective layer of fat.
 
* NO SPIRITS, NOR VODKA, serve. The strongest vodka is 40% alcohol, and you need 65%.
 
* Most mouthwashes are not effective at killing virus. Most of them are ~21% alchohol. LISTERINE Antiseptic is guaranteed to kill 99.9% of plaque causing bacteria, but will not destroy the virus. It should not be used to clean surfaces with 
 
* The more confined the space, the more concentration of the virus there can be. The more open or naturally ventilated, the less.
 
* You have to wash your hands before and after touching mucosa, food, locks, knobs, switches, remote control, cell phone, watches, computers, desks, TV, etc. And when using the bathroom.
 
* You have to HUMIDIFY HANDS DRY from so much washing them, because the molecules can hide in the micro cracks. The thicker the moisturizer, the better.
 
* Also keep your NAILS SHORT so that the virus does not hide there.
