 What does it really mean when a state declares a state of emergency? I've been following the 1point3acres website and I notice a few states have declared states of emergency without any confirmed cases. So, a big question:

&amp;#x200B;

1. What actually happens when a state declares a state of emergency?
2. What does that mean for me and mine?

Tried googling the answer, but I'd like to see what you guys say. I find myself needing to get information from multiple sources to be able to divine the truth these days. :(

 The United States is a federal system. Your governor has more power than the President Civics reminder: in the United States, state and local government has more power and responsibility in domestic emergencies, such as this one, than the federal government. The federal government provides additional resources to state and local governments in the event their capacity is exceeded.

If you're mad that schools, bars, restaurants, etc aren't closed, look towards your governor, not the President.

If we get to a point where the President must order quarantines, then your local and state government failed you. The burden is upon them, not the feds.

 Strategic National Stockpile website changed after Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner's controversial statement on national TV ~~Nepotism is usually discouraged within large private organizations for good reason. Our current president has placed a very questionably qualified daughter husband team within his administration.~~

~~Unfortunately, this is a perfect example of why nepotism should be illegal at this level within our federal government. Dare I say, Trumps daughter Ivanka and Jared Kushner are next to useless other than possible moral support for "Dad. Would this role be more appropriate outside the administration, rather than wasting two taxpayer paid positions?~~

~~Trump reportedly does not take a salary for his position. What about team Kushner? How much do we pay them?~~

.


**Crossed out above because I didn't initially intend to get political, and  potentially get shutdown for comments or deleted.**

.

Getting back on track, this is specifically about what Jared Kushner said in a TV appearence during one of Trumps
~~campaign events~~ **Correction:** coronavirus briefings. : 

And the aftermath that included changing the US federal governments Strategic National Stockpile website.

.

**Has the function and scope of US federal governments Strategic National Stockpile actually changed?**
**I ask because of the urgency of the coronavirus pandemic and the possible implications of this change for us as citizens of the US.**

.

**BEFORE:**

&gt; Strategic National Stockpile is the nationâ€™s largest supply of life-saving pharmaceuticals and medical supplies 
&gt; for use in a public health emergency severe enough to cause local supplies to run out. 
&gt;
&gt; When state, local, tribal, and territorial responders request federal assistance to support their response efforts, 
&gt; the stockpile ensures that the right medicines and supplies get to those who need them most during an emergency.
&gt;
&gt; Organized for scalable response to a variety of public health threats, 
&gt; this repository contains enough supplies to respond to multiple large-scale emergencies simultaneously.
    

**AFTER:**

&gt; The Strategic National Stockpile's role is to supplement state and local supplies during public health emergencies.
&gt;
&gt; Many states have products stockpiled, as well.
&gt; 
&gt; The supplies, medicines, and devices for life-saving care contained in the stockpile can be used as a short-term stopgap buffer 
&gt; when the immediate supply of adequate amounts of these materials may not be immediately available.
    

**Sources:** 

**BEFORE:** 

**AFTER:**

 Is Trump Using Medical Resources As Leverage For Support and Votes? I would love to know what others think about this. 

It seems that Governors who do not agree with Trump, go against what he says, or he just does not like, are not receiving the desperately needed life-saving equipment they were promised.

I am reading about, and hearing his own words where he says "Governors that are nice to us" or "treat us right". I find it terrifying to think that this man is in charge of allocating resources and we all know he is not above blackmail to get what he wants.

This might explain why some Governors have been slow to issue a stay at home or shelter in place order. Is Trump telling them that if they do, he will not provide medical assistance?

 These US States enacted arrival control for visitors from other US States. With the lack of federal domestic travel restrictions other States must join asap to stop the spread of the virus and help the soonest recovery of our economy. "The governors of Alaska, Hawaii, New Hampshire and Massachusetts have mandated that travelers arriving from out of state mustÂ self-quarantine for two weeks upon arrival.Â Other states, including South Carolina, Texas, Florida and Rhode Island,  are targeting their own self-quarantine mandates to visitors who arrive from highly affected areas "

 Is there a trend showing blue states declaring states of emergencies vs red states not? Iâ€™m in GA and the number of cases has tripled between yesterday and today, and yet our governor still has not declared a state of emergency, so all of our public universities are still open. I am fearing this is him not wanting to admit anything is wrong to not make Trump look bad? But thatâ€™s speculation on my part
