 Is silver product effective to killing Corona virus? First of all, I don't mean 'drinking silver' treatment,  It is FAKE and have dangerous side effects according to FDA. Don't try it.
What I wanted to ask is that [ according to this article (Ionic)Silver was proven to killing SARS, and as I know SARS's DNA is pretty similar with coronavirus. If I use silver(coated) spoon will it kill the virus on its surface?

 NOVID - Anonymous COVID Contact Tracing App Here’s the info I found (and what makes it sick):

[NOVID]( is the first and only completely anonymous COVID-19 contact-tracing app published in the USA that uses no personal information. Founded by Carnegie Mellon professor Dr. Po-Shen Loh, [NOVID]( uses bluetooth and ultrasound to monitor your distance from and time spent around other users to completely anonymously warn you in advance if you are exposed to the virus.

The app has a "[Community]( feature, which will allow the area’s administration to section out areas to procure COVID-19 data, such as interactions and cases, that happen in the area, all while maintaining the anonymity of the people. With this, the administration can constantly monitor the trajectory of the virus and take decisions for the school’s safety accordingly.

 PSA for buying food If you’re trying to stock up on food, especially frozen food, don’t overlook the vegetarian aisle! I guarantee it will be more stocked, and I promise you things still taste good.

There’s even frozen pizza, and I know how the cheese pizza goes first at the party. So definitely consider buying the meatless options! 

I’d like to note, that this is my own personal account, and also accounts from family and friends in other states, and it may be a case by case basis.

 COVID - 19 Info from JHU * The virus is not a living organism, but a protein molecule (RNA) covered by a protective layer of lipid (fat), which, when absorbed by the cells of the ocular, nasal or buccal mucosa, changes their genetic code. (mutation) and convert them into aggressor and multiplier cells.
 
* Since the virus is not a living organism but a protein molecule, it is not killed, but decays on its own. The disintegration time depends on the temperature, humidity and type of material where it lies.
 
* The virus is very fragile; the only thing that protects it is a thin outer layer of fat. That is why any soap or detergent is the best remedy, because the foam CUTS the FAT (that is why you have to rub so much: for 20 seconds or more, to make a lot of foam).
 
By dissolving the fat layer, the protein molecule disperses and breaks down on its own.
 
* HEAT melts fat; this is why it is so good to use water above 25 degrees Celsius for washing hands, clothes and everything. In addition, hot water makes more foam and that makes it even more useful.
 
* Alcohol or any mixture with alcohol over 65% DISSOLVES ANY FAT, especially the external lipid layer of the virus.
 
* Any mix with 1 part bleach and 5 parts water directly dissolves the protein, breaks it down from the inside.
 
* Oxygenated water helps long after soap, alcohol and chlorine, because peroxide dissolves the virus protein, but you have to use it pure and it hurts your skin.
 
* NO BACTERICIDE OR ANTIBIOTIC SERVES. The virus is not a living organism like bacteria; antibodies cannot kill what is not alive.
 
* NEVER shake used or unused clothing, sheets or cloth. While it is glued to a porous surface, it is very inert and disintegrates only
-between 3 hours (fabric and porous),
-4 hours (copper and wood)
-24 hours (cardboard),
- 42 hours (metal) and
-72 hours (plastic).
 
But if you shake it or use a feather duster, the virus molecules float in the air for up to 3 hours, and can lodge in your nose.
 
* The virus molecules remain very stable in external cold, or artificial as air conditioners in houses and cars.
 
They also need moisture to stay stable, and especially darkness. Therefore, dehumidified, dry, warm and bright environments will degrade it faster.
 
* UV LIGHT on any object that may contain it breaks down the virus protein. For example, to disinfect and reuse a mask is perfect. Be careful, it also breaks down collagen (which is protein) in the skin.
 
* The virus CANNOT go through healthy skin.
 
* Vinegar is NOT useful because it does not break down the protective layer of fat.
 
* NO SPIRITS, NOR VODKA, serve. The strongest vodka is 40% alcohol, and you need 65%.
 
* LISTERINE IF IT SERVES! It is 65% alcohol.
 
* The more confined the space, the more concentration of the virus there can be. The more open or naturally ventilated, the less.
 
* You have to wash your hands before and after touching mucosa, food, locks, knobs, switches, remote control, cell phone, watches, computers, desks, TV, etc. And when using the bathroom.
 
* You have to HUMIDIFY HANDS DRY from so much washing them, because the molecules can hide in the micro cracks. The thicker the moisturizer, the better.
 
* Also keep your NAILS SHORT so that the virus does not hide there.

 Hand sanitizer is sold out everywhere I go (NJ). Buy rubbing alcohol if you can't get sanitizer. Walmart, Shoprite, Walgreens, Dollar store, CVS, Target - all sold out of hand sanitizer. 

I bought a few bottles of rubbing alcohol and a few empty spray bottles. Worse comes to worse, you can spray your hands with rubbing alcohol, which is effectively the same thing as using alcohol based sanitizer.

Just an FYI.

 Please stop buying up all the water I unfortunately live in my car, and have been in this situation for quite a while. Typically, I buy 1 gallon jugs of water in combination with public water from my college and public library. Both the library and my college are closed. Now I pretty much have to rely on the bottled water. However, people are buying all of them up, and I'm forced to ration my water intake.

So please use your tap water, as I can't. Boil it if you're that afraid.

 More risky to fly a few hours or drive across country? I know, I know... I’m the last person to want to travel right now but we might have to move for husbands job soon (January)

Debating taking a flight (4 hours) vs renting a car or van and driving across country (5 days @ 8 hours a day) and either sleeping in the van or staying at motels that have exterior doors. 

What would you do and why? I am leaning toward driving and just keeping enough food and drink in the car so we don’t have to stop much..

 Stores Are Running Out of Food, Water, Cleaning Supplies - People Are Panicking I went to 4 different Supermarkets and there is no bottled water left, people are buying all the food left on the shelves, there is not toilet paper, paper towels, hand sanitizer, or any household cleaners left to buy.

So if we don't die from the coronavirus, will we die from starvation? What if we don't have clean water and rely on bottled water but there is not bottled water left? How do we get food? Are we supposed to grow our own food now?

If we don't have hand sanitizer left, how do we keep clean?

If we don't have toilet paper, how do we go to the bathroom?

What the heck is happening here?

I guess no one thought this day will come when you the supermarkets are out of food, there is no where to go that is safe from pandemic?

The travel ban will help mitigate the spread of the virus, but we do we do when there is no food or water left?

 My speculation on Coronavirus This is me being bored and letting my head wonder. I have being thinking a lot of stuff🤔 and something came through my head. This what came through my head🤔and opinion and Let me speculate 🤔 this is just a speculation 🤔 during the WWW 1 all soldiers friendlier or enemies where using bio chemicals and gas spread like a virus. It has  the same symptoms as the corona virus. 🤔this In my opinion makes me think and wonder if we are being bio , gas in the air. 🤔🤔🤔🤔 me that i am sick and have health problems i get sick easily and i am more sensitive to whats going on the environment. For a couple of months i have being having bronchitis neumonia and breathing problems asthma etc... before the corona virus. My body has been trying to defend itself from this weird bronchitis neumonía virus. I told like a month ago to my mom that maybe it is something in the air since bronchitis neumonía is a infection u get when Air pollution , dust , and toxic gases in the environment when air is toxic. When the  news of corona virus came out i told my mom now i know whats going on with me. Remember i told i have being sick with bronchitis neumonía for months and problems with breathing. I even went to the hospital and their solution is to give me a pump. No medications they obviously they didn’t know what is going on. But know i suspect that something can be on the environment what if ? 🤷‍♀️🤔 or could be me being paranoid 🤷‍♀️or this corona virus could be what they say a virus. All this things that has being happening to me all this month it is What makes me think that this virus 🦠 can be cause by bio gas ? 🤔but i am not a professional to  get proof of it. This is just my especulación because the symptoms of the bio gas are almost the same as the corona  virus. This just my especulación. I don’t know 🤷‍♀️ i think the government should check the air and see if nothing wrong with the air. Probably i am paranoid 🤷‍♀️ but won’t hurt to check the air . Tell me what u think 🤔 probably i have to much time for myself that i am letting my head wonder 🤔but it won’t hurt to check the air environment to discard any possibility.

 6 QUESTIONS for EXPERTS: PLEASE only answer if you have scholarly information; no speculation or extrapolations. I understand that viruses, strictly speaking, are not 'alive'; that they are vessels for DNA that infect living beings and highjacks their systems to make more viruses; I also understand that viruses cannot 'survive' for long periods of time when they are outside of a living host. So my questions are:

**\*** **PLEASE only answer if you have scholarly information, no speculation or extrapolations \***

1. How does a virus 'die' when it is outside of a living host, what damages them? (dehydration, disintegration, etc)

2. Once 'dead', can a virus be revived? Is there something that may reactivate a virus?

3. What are the temperatures that will 'kill' a virus? -Can they be 'killed' by boiling temperatures? Can they be 'killed' by freezing temperatures? And if so, can a frozen virus be reanimated once its temperature reaches tropical levels?

4. What are the most efficient measures that lay people can take to neutralize a surface that has active viruses on it (alcohol, bleach, lysol, UV lamp, etc; and how much of each should be used? is a second or two of exposure to any of those agents enough to effectively clean say, a desk?

5. Is One more vulnerable breathing through One's mouth than One's nose because there is no mucus in the mouth? Should people make it a habit to close their mouth as much as possible while around other people, and only breath through their nose?

6. Besides saliva and mucus, what other human secretions carry active viruses? (Urine, sweat, etc)

 A lot of people are letting 9/11 shape their reaction to COVID -19 After 9/11, we all ran around living our lives bravely and telling each other that any sign of fear (staying home, not flying, etc.) was letting the terrorists win.

Now, many are reacting the same way, going on as normal in an effort to show no fear and not let the virus win.

The virus is not a terrorist.  It has no motive.  You cannot beat a virus through bravery...or stupidity.

 Proposed Name Change It would be better and clearer to change the name of this sub and stop referring to the current epidemic as being caused by "coronavirus."  There are LOTS of corona viruses and there have been a number of outbreaks of sickness due to these various corona viruses.

A better name for this particular corona virus is **Wuhan virus**, which accurately describes the source of this particular virus and the illness which it is causing.

 Pof. Christian Drosten: genetic analysis shows that the early variation of the virus is relatively frequent in the US, which suggests that it was imported at an early stage and that it remained undetected for a long time In his latest podcast, Germany's top virologist Pof. Christian Drosten claims that:

&gt;From the fact that the USA got something from both - including the early virus - we can also see that the virus was apparently introduced into the USA very early. At the same time, we cannot say in the United States that one virus would look more dangerous than the other. So there the two viruses can still be distinguished from each other. But they don't look clinically different. We can deduce something else from this knowledge, from these sequences. This is often the case with sequences. You think you are sequencing the virus and can immediately conclude that the virus has different functions or different pathogenic effects. But in reality you can do something else. For example, one can reconstruct temporal and spatial relationships from certain logical considerations. If you know, for example, that the early virus in China is relatively common in the United States today, we can deduce relatively directly from it that the United States probably had many entries from China relatively early on that it just did not notice. This is also the big problem in the United States that testing has not been done consistently until it has been noticed. And suddenly there is a problem that you can hardly control because you just didn't know it was there. And apparently it has been there for a long time.

 COVID-19 Hysteria This opinion is not going to be popular but what is going on with this virus is so overblown. There is a big issue with people not getting tests for the CODVID-19 virus. We don’t know for sure how many people have this virus. Yet we went through SARS, H1N1, the bird flu, the Ebola virus and so many more and they’re all more deadly and more infections than the corona virus and no one cared all that much. There were many unknowns about these viruses as well. If you are older or have lung conditions or compromised immune systems. You should quarantine. You should avoid visitors and the pubic. Everyone else? There is no reason to freak out. This virus has a 2 percent death rate. 80 percent of the 2 percent of deaths are from people over the age of 60 or with compromised immune systems. Take that 2 percent and if you aren’t in that category you have a very high chance of survival. Now the media is saying well this could happen or that could happen so just in case we need to all freak out and hide in the closet. There are a lot of what ifs with every virus we’ve ever had. Anything could happen. The media and memes are also going around saying this is so much deadlier than the seasonal flu that happens every year. Let’s look at the facts. The CDC says this on the influenza virus: [

From October 1st to March 7th there have been  22,000 to 55,000 deaths from the flu virus. 

As of this writing there have been 8,969 deaths from the corona virus. This is from January 22nd to March 16th. 

Now if you take each month equally the corona virus kills 5,047 people a month while the flu virus kills 4,246-10,617 people a month. 

Is it more infectious though? There are 124,631 infections of corona virus. Let’s times that by 4 which is over the amount of time the flu infected people. That’s 498,524 people infected. There’s areas with no tests so let’s just triple that for any cases that may not be known as a broad estimate. That would be 1,495,572 let’s just even double that number and make it 2,991,144 people that could be infected right now. Pretty scary right?

Guess what? The flu infected 36 million to 51 million people over the same time period. So there is no evidence right now at all that the corona virus is more infectious than the influenza virus or more deadly.

Media sensationalism and fear mongering is causing even doctors offices to close down which will burden our ER’s even more with many people who will die without treatment. There is a huge cost of unemployment that is going to burden our economy. Many people cannot even get unemployment who own their own business. They’re facing losing their jobs, their homes because of this. 

A lot of this fear is also being fueled by ignorance and xenophobic anti Chinese sentiments. Viruses have been here since the beginning of our own cells. They occur and spread from all over the world. Many of the worst ones are from bats who have super immune systems. These bats can infect other people and animals. The virus did not start from a dirty food market in China. Unclean areas breed bacteria which is completely different than a virus so that doesn’t even make sense. A virus doesn’t mutate or form from sitting in garbage. Some people are scared to order packages from China. A virus cannot even live on a package that long. It was also not from a woman eating a bat that is a hoax that was disproven. We don’t know where yet this virus came from. Chinese people are being beaten in the streets because of this virus. People are posting signs in countries saying Chinese people are not welcome. People are afraid to eat at Chinese restaurants. A Chinese man died of a heart attack because no one would help him. This was not manufactured in a lab or purposely let loose cause China just felt like it would be a good idea to kill a bunch of its own citizens for no reason. The U.S. does not get along with China. We are fed anti Chinese propaganda and many people know little to nothing about the country there and what it’s really like. It is not a third world country. The virus is not some evil Chinese plot. Get it together. It is not a Chinese virus. It should not be called the Chinese virus. The most dangerous virus in the world was spread from Germany. It has a 70-90 percent death rate. Now that’s something to freak out about.

 Tips for when shopping during this time! 1. Buy what you think you would need to last you 1-2 months. 
2. DO NOT BUY OUT AN ENTIRE STORE 
3. Check online to see if nearby stores have what you're looking for and then call to confirm cause sometimes it takes the system a long time to update online.
4. Try to buy in store not online if you can and feel it's safe as some people live in rural places and they do most of their ordering online.
5. USE COMMON SENSE
6. Buy food stored in cans, you can buy frozen/fridge foods too but remember, if power goes out, the food will go bad unless you have or are planning to buy a generator
7. Do shopping for your entire family if you can, minimize the amount of people inside a store
8. Buy water. Juices and soda isn't a priority. 
9. Buy a water purifier/filter. They are fairly cheap and you can use to refill bottles of water
10. Keep your distance and stay safe!

 Why are people spending relief and unemployment money on drugs and extravagant dinners? Excuse me, folks. 

But every time I go on my Instagram I see my unemployed friends spending government money on drinks, drugs, clothes and restaurants. 

One of them is in Florida and went right over to the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino and also bought ketamine. 

A girl I know in New York spent her money on a trip to the beach with her friends and used it to buy pot and wine bottles. 

Then there was the story earlier this week about the man in Miami who spent his PPP loans on a lambhorghini and extravagant dinners for women he met on dating sites. 

Im really surprised at the insane idiocy of these people. Not so much because they are doing this during a pandemic but because they are acting like they have such an extravagant lifestyle but are really just mooching off the government. 

Am I the only one witnessing this?

 One of my friends said that people shouldn’t let the virus stop them from doing what they enjoy. What’s your thoughts on what he say? Honestly I do kind of agree with him, instead of staying indoors and let the virus stop what you want to do you should go outside and enjoy like go for a run, play basketball at the park, but obviously avoid to crowded places and touching stuff. Now if I said that to someone they would be like “So your fine with getting the virus and being in quarantine”? No, we’re obviously aware of the virus and even if our chances of getting the virus increases we know that we’re enjoying life and not letting this virus get in the way. But we’re obvious still cautious about everything and go out with more care because there’s elderly around and there more immune to COVID-19. He also brought up that at the end of the day he’s living life and not letting the virus ruin his break and part of his life. Pretty much if this virus gets to him he knows that he spent his days enjoying life instead of trying to survive.

Obviously if someone has elders at home they should stay inside.

 HELP: If I take a Covid PCR test 84 hours before my flight, but the results are received 70 hours before my flight, and the results are reported 62 hours before my flight, will I still be accepted for my international flight requirement of “negative test results within 72 hours”? I have a round-trip flight at 10:50PM on Thursday, and my airline requires that I have a COVID-19 negative test result no older than 72 hours before departure. 

Does this mean that my test result needs to be **released** within 72 hours of my flight, or **collected** within 72 hours of my flight? Because the place I’m going to tomorrow, sends the COVID tests the next morning to be tested. 

I currently have an appointment for PCR test tomorrow, and another elsewhere on Tuesday to be safe. Even though the test tomorrow isn’t within 72 hours of my flight, it is still within 3 calendar days (Monday+3 days=Thursday). 

I apologize if it seems confusing how I’m asking it.

 The Authority &amp; Governments Are Making Many Big Mistakes Over The Corona Virus COVID-19 NCOV **The Authority &amp; Governments Are Making Many Big Mistakes Over The Corona Virus COVID-19 NCOV**

I just want to tell the hard truth so hopefully they can change for the better, or otherwise many nations will disappear because of this corona virus for sure.

Here are the big mistakes of many big international groups &amp; national governments:

**1. Censorship**  
 If you cannot face the truth and tell the real problems, but only cover/hide it and expect it will “miracle go away”, then you would utterly wrong.  
 

First, the China covered it up, that is why is spread worldwide.  
 Second, the Western Government covered it up as well, they censored all kind of theory about this virus online. That is why their citizens did not fear and now is crazy deadly situation after the corona virus fully touch down their land.

**2. Underestimate, Do Not Respect The New Corona Virus NCOV**  
 I have said and warned the dangerous of this virus, but all of you were deleted my only text-base theory post. Now it turned out it all the fact and hard truth.

**If any scientist and/or authority, government can prove my theory about this corona virus is wrong, I would close my websites instantly !!!**

**3. Listening False Prophets Instead Of The Savior**  
 Many secret societies and governments know what the hex are they doing, many of them are listening to false prophet/fortune teller, etc. Instead of facing the hard truth.

I as the savior will never play encrypt message, only a direct straight forward communication.

You have more chance to survive if you listen to any entities can tell “have cure/solution” for the problems instead of rely on “safe choice” who only tell you “try, not sure it work”.

That are the 3 big major mistakes the authorities are making, if they do not change, then they will collapse and die because of this corona virus NCOV for sure.

The rich the elite, government officials will gone first for ignore the savior Messiah, then latter to the poor.

Hopefully, they can wake up and change for the better.

Best Regard,  
**The Savior**

 I’m running out, please don’t be Captain Hindsight I used the toilet paper calculator I saw online and it looks like if we conserve we have 8 days. All the stores are empty and Amazon too. I have random tissue reserves and some methods I’d rather not resort to. I didn’t realize it would be this bad, I’m considering buying a bidet, but the lead time is bonkers long. This is temporary, there’s only so much everyone will buy of toilet paper.

I need toilet paper, in 8 days.

This is a minor inconvenience compared to the future lack of food. It’s already started, when you need to not “shelter in place” because you’ll need food, you’ll see. Only because I’m tall could I reach the three frozen vegetables packages in the section of the aisle. I’ll need food/fresh water too when that runs out. What’s money good for in April if there’s nothing to buy? Can we get some to now, instead of in April when we can still use it? I’m happy the administration is finally taking steps but food and toilet paper need to be in the discussion. 

What’s the plan for food, and for the short term toilet paper? Don’t even get me started on masks, gloves, and ventilators.

 Field Report - Kansas City MO Went to the grocery on the way home. It was business as usual for the after-work rush hour. 

There were two bottles of rubbing alcohol left. All the sanitizer was gone. Much of the hand soap was gone. There was plenty of bleach but the cheap store brand bleach was sold out. 

Ramen, bread, rice all fully stocked. Pasta was light for one brand that was on sale for $.99/pound. The rest was fully stocked. 

TP and paper towels were stocked. Lysol spray and Lysol and Clorox wipes were looking thin. Store brand wipes were sold out. 

Water was stocked.

 Why you do not need to worry about the supply of groceries in either the short or long term. Simple Logic. The US is not consuming any more food than we did a week ago. (Except you stress eaters. :p) Our overall need for food did not change at all. It’s not like we absorbed millions of people all of a sudden.

The virus does not stop grocery stores from being open. The lock downs do not either.
The virus does not stop the truckers from delivering goods.
The virus does not stop the manufacturers from manufacturing.

WITH NO REAL CHANGES TO OUR NEEDS VERSUS OUR CAPACITY EQUALS NO REASON TO WORRY ABOUT FOOD SHORTAGES AND NO NEED TO HOARD FOOD
The empty shelves are simply the increased purchasing wiping them out. We all bought 2-4 weeks more food than we normally do in panic. Calm down and let the system get back to normal. There is plenty of food everywhere. Just give all the workers time to do their jobs and restock the shelves. If the pace slackens we will be back to (almost) normal in a couple weeks.

I say “almost” because there will be oddities that will be hard to turn on a dime. An example are things like frozen foods and definitely toilet paper.
