 DAILY UPDATE Coronavirus US % growth for March 27 - trends are mixed, with confirmed cases slightly down and deaths slightly up Below is a summary of the **US** trends yesterday (late EST), available [in more detail here]( (now including individual country breakdowns, updated automatically once a day). I give a more broad summary on the [Global trends here](

I've also [started vlogging]( a take that's half analytical, and half covering the day's Reddit and Twitter threads.

**Confirmed Cases**

This daily delta for confirmed cases yesterday was down. A total of **17,821** new cases. Although still the 2nd highest increase ever.

The growth rate was down at the lowest since March 18, at **21.26%**.

Note that the testing capabilities may have risen in general, and there may also be a larger amount of people testing negative. I'd love to have access to that data too, but so far we don't

**Deaths**

It was another all time high again yesterday in the increase in deaths. The total increase was **372**.

That brings the growth rate to **30.8%** yesterday. If the trend follows other countries, this rate will decrease as the number rises.

The WHO death rate went up slightly to **1.5%** yesterday, after 2 consecutive days at 1.4% (this is the rate that the media was often citing at being 1-2% in February).

I've consistently chosen to additionally track the death rate on the number of recovered. This is still consistently climbing, once more at a new peak yesterday, of **64.5%** (NOTE: *John Hopkins CSSE have announced they are soon going to cease tracking the number of recovered, so this stat won't be available for much longer!*)*.*

**Incubation Deaths**

The rate that takes into account the 14 day incubation period, comparing the number of deaths yesterday to the number of confirmed cases 14 days ago. This is still increasing, once more at an all time high, at **42.0%**.

**Disclaimer:** *Please take from this what you choose. Even though I've started to track individual country data, it may still be too small to associate any defining trends from the % growth.*

*I am just breaking down official numbers, and although the official numbers may or may not reflect exactly how many cases remain unreported, I try to remain unopinionated in these reportings and leave the opinions and analysis to the comments*

 Coronavirus death rates? We may never know how many people have contracted this Coronavirus and how many deaths are Coronavirus-related, especially those who have passed without having been tested. However, I share a genuine concern and curiousity regarding the death rates.

The reported death rates of 2%-8% for confirmed cases is a measurement of case fatality: confirmed deaths divided by confirmed cases. However, is this an accurate representation of how fatal the Coronavirus is, given that this metric includes individuals who had tested positive as early as yesterday and have not progressed far yet? For closed cases (recovered, discharged, death), that death rate is much higher at 21% (

Considerations for false-positive, false-negative, and differences in reporting aside, is the true death rate somewhere between these two metrics?

 Reporting price gouging to end product “shortages”!! Are eBay and Amazon doing any kind of mass identifying on their end for people who are price gouging important supplies such as toilet paper and artificially creating shortages?

Until more is done, I do see that there is a Report ability for people to report individual posts. I’d encourage anyone bored at home to report report report to help end the shortage!!!

Example for toilet paper on eBay:
1. Click “Report This Item” (upper left corner on mobile)
2. Report Category: Prohibited and Restricted Items
3. Reason for Report: Price gouging
4. Detailed Reason: Sanitation Items

Any other ways for consumers to report price gouging?

COVID-19 is not something you should be cheerleading, whichever side you sit on, but here we are!

 A list of the most common comorbidities in Covid-related deaths and the percentage of the US adult population with each comorbity. For those people arguing (or even thinking) that Americans need to get back to work and lift stay at home orders for the sake of the economy because "only" people with pre-existing comorbidities are dying from Covid, this is a list of the comorbidities at play, along with the percentage of the US adult population with each comorbity. I am using New York's death statistics.

87% of Covid deaths in NY involved people with at least 1 comorbidity. 

55% of all covid deaths in New York involved the comorbity of hypertension. 45% of the adult population of the US is estimated to have hypertension or high good pressure according to the CDC. (Citation in linked article)

33% of all covid deaths in New York involved the comorbity of diabetes. 13% of the adult population in the US has diabetes. (Source: CDC  National Diabetes Statistics Report, Estimates of Diabetes and Its Burden in the United States)

18% of all covid deaths in New York involved the comorbity of hyperlipidemia. 12% of the adult population in the US has hyperlipidemia. (

12% of all covid deaths in New York involved the comorbity of coronary artery disease.
6.7% of the adult population of the U.S has coronary artery disease. (

11% of all covid deaths in New York involved the comorbity of renal disease. 15% of the adult population of the U.S has renal disease. (National Kidney Foundation 

9% of all covid deaths in New York involved the comorbity of dementia. 2.5% (edited) of the adult population of the U.S has dementia. (

8.3% of all covid deaths in New York involved the comorbity of COPD.
5% of the adult population of the U.S has COPD. (

8.1% of covid deaths in New York involved the comorbidity of a history of cancer.
38.4% of the adult population of the U.S has had or will get some form of cancer. (

7.1% of covid deaths in New York involved the comorbidity of AFib.
2% of the adult population of the U.S younger than 65 has AFib, while 9% over 65 have it. (

7.1% of covid deaths in New York involved the comorbidity of heart failure.
2% of the adult population of the U.S has heart failure and 48% of adult Americans have some form of cardiovascular disease.(

Those numbers dont seem so comforting for the "average" population anymore, do they?
