 Returners from Italy - unclear advice? Hi all - a bit of background - I returned to the UK 7 days ago from the Lombardy region where I had been for a couple weeks. I haven't had any symptoms at all but have self-isolated since returning, given the risks of unknowingly spreading this virus if I was to have an asymptomatic case or it hadn't 'kicked in' yet. 

Last night the official Government advice changed to this ([

*'Stay indoors and avoid contact with other people if you’ve travelled to the UK from the following places in the last 14 days, even if you do not have symptoms:*

* *Iran*
* *Hubei province in China*
* [*lockdown areas in northern Italy*](
* [*special care zones in South Korea*](

So now I am in this category, having returned 7 days ago from that region. A couple points on this - there's no information there on how long I need to self isolate for, is this indefinitely for now or (I presume) for 14 days from the date I returned? I've tried to find ways of asking without clogging up the 111 line so was hoping someone here might have an idea.

Also I felt like I had to dig for this info - no mention at all on the regular news channels only a couple mentions in live blogs. How are they getting this word out to returned travellers? I know of 4 people as of this morning who have returned in the past week and had no idea the advice had changed.

 Do you think working in the hospital you are more or less certain to get corona? I’m a health care worker and things like social distancing are impossible and we also lack the correct protective gear. I love my job but I really wish I didn’t work in the hospital at this time. I know I have a duty of care and I and I am good at my job but all that is going is terrifying. 

I feel like at this point it’s unavoidable. I have two young children and this is just making me feel anxious constantly. I’m actually considering deleting reddit so I don’t check up on corona news anymore.

We have confirmed cases on our ward and a lack of gear to protect ourselves. I haven’t even been fit tested for the masks and I’m expected to go into rooms with corona patients. What about testing staff? Even my superiors seem to be abit in the dark about everything.

Sorry for the rant but this whole thing is making me nervous. I am going to go to work tomorrow and try get some answers about certain things.

 Social Distancing - BBC Local Radio Interview - Dr Duncan Robertson 
++++++++++
 Staying safe is more subtle than "keep 2m apart" There's some interesting commentary on the [staying safe outside your home]( guidance about the 2m rule. A lot of people seem to have the impression that infected people are surrounded by a kind of "force field" extending exactly 2m in all directions around them; touch that field even for an instant and you'll be infected, keep outside and it and you will be fine.

The reality is far more subtle. The risk comes predominantly from small droplets sprayed from the infected person's mouth and nose when they cough, sneeze or talk. These droplets typically don't go as far as 2m, hence the guidance. But crucially, if the other person **isn't** talking, coughing or sneezing, and they aren't facing you, the risk is extremely small even if you are briefly closer than 2m. If you meet somebody coming the other way on a narrow path or corridor, turn away from each other and keep your mouths closed, and you will both be fine. If you can keep more than 2m, then you should, but it's not as critical as people imagine.

The big risk comes from having a conversation with somebody. You're facing each other, both talking, both spraying drops at each other. Even at 2m the risk isn't zero then, especially if it's a long conversation (though if you're both masked then that helps a lot). This is probably why people in customer service roles are sadly dying in such high numbers. And this is why I get angry when I hear stories of people shouting at others for getting briefly within 1.5m of them - that shouting is causing far more of a risk than the original close distancing.

And it should go without saying: if you're coughing and sneezing, you shouldn't be going near anybody.

 I think I’ve worked it out... Not OC but seen elsewhere but Ive not yet seen on reddit. 

* 4 year olds can go to school but university students who have paid for their tuition and the accommodation that they aren’t living in, can’t go back to university. 

* I can go to school with many 4 year olds that I’m not related to but can’t see one 4 year old that I am related to. 

* I can sit in a park, but not tomorrow or Tuesday but by Wednesday that’ll be fine. 

* I can meet one person from another household for a chat or to sunbathe but not two people so if I know two people  from another household I have to pick my favourite. Hopefully, I’m also their favourite person from my household or this could be awkward. But possibly I’m not. In fact, thinking about it, I definitely wouldn’t be. But as I can’t go closer than 2m to the one I choose anyway so you wouldn’t think having the other one sat next to them would matter - unless two people would restrict my eyeline too much and prevent me from being alert. 

* I can work all day with my colleagues but I can’t sit in their garden for a chat after work. 

* I can now do unlimited exercise when quite frankly just doing an hour a day felt like I was some kind of fitness guru. I can think of lots of things that I would like to be unlimited but exercise definitely isn’t one of them. 

* I can drive to other destinations although which destinations is unclear. I was supposed to be in Brighton this weekend. Can I drive there? It’s hundreds of miles away but no one has said that’s wrong. 

* The buses are still running past my house but I shouldn’t get on one. We should just let empty buses drive around so bus drivers aren’t doing nothing. 

* It will soon be time to quarantine people coming into the country by air... but not yet. It’s too soon. And not ever if you’re coming from France because... well, I don’t do know why, actually. Because the French version of coronavirus wouldn’t come to the UK maybe. 

* Our youngest children go back to school first because... they are notoriously good at not touching things they shouldn’t, maintain personal space at all times and never randomly lick you. 

* We are somewhere in between 3.5 and 4.5 on a five point scale where 5 is all of the virus and 1 is none of the virus but 2,3 and 4 can be anything you’d like it to be really. Some of the virus? A bit of the virus? Just enough virus to see off those over 70s who were told to self isolate but now we’ve realised that they’ve done that a bit too well  despite us offloading coronavirus patients into care homes and now we are claiming that was never said in the first place, even though it’s in writing in the stay at home guidance. 

* The slogan isn’t stay at home any more.So we don’t have to say at home. Except we do. Unless we can’t. In which case we should go out. But there will be fines if we break the rules. So don’t do that. 

Don’t forget... 

Stay alert... which Robert Jenrick has explained actually means Stay home as much as possible. Obviously. 

Control the virus. Well, I can’t even control my dogs and I can actually see them. Plus I know a bit about dogs and very little about controlling viruses. 

Save lives. Always preferable to not saving lives, I’d say, so I’ll try my best with that 
one, although hopefully I don’t need telling to do that. I know I’m bragging now but not NOT saving lives is something I do every day. 

So there you are.  If you’re the weirdo wanting unlimited exercise then enjoy. But not until Wednesday. Obviously.

 Canary Wharf collapsing man was a hoax! Mirror Online: 'Coronavirus cougher' who collapsed in London's Canary Wharf exposed as sick hoax.

++++++++++
 What I have learned about this. For anyone who is relatively new to this. 

I have been following this since the first outbreak. For some reason I saw this immediately as a threat. I’ve never worried about any other outbreak before. But this is what you need to know. 

This is extremely contagious. You can get this by literally walking into someone’s fart in the veg aisle at Tesco’s. And yes I’m not kidding. It has an r0 of around 5. Which means for every one person who gets it they spread it to about 5 people. 

You can catch this by someone breathing on you.  By touching money. From your clothes if someone has sneezed or coughed near you and the wind blown it on you. Being in a public toilet where someone has been. Up to two hours previously. 

It’s not just the flu. 1 in five who contract this will need hospital treatment. It depletes oxygen so you will need supplemented oxygen and in some cases a vit c boost. And it can leave permanent damage. 

The CFR or mortality rate is 3.4%. I’m sorry to say I expect this to rise. 

It incubates and you can be contagious. I’m sorry to say any one of us could have this and not have a clue. You can have the virus for up to 21 days. (Extreme cases) or a week or two and be spreading it. As could anyone else. This is the part that means this is unstoppable right now. 

Vit c. Magnesium. Zinc. Vit d. All good supplements to take. And can help the body fight off the nasties.  Our bodies do have some defences. Likely we will all breath these little critters in at some point. But not everyone will contract it.  The better equipped our bodies are the better we can get rid of it. These are not cures they just help. 

If someone in your home is isolated. I’m sorry to say the chances of them spreading in your house is very high. The only way is to tape the door around the edges. And have a vent fitted to the room. Just look at hospital isolation wards 

It effects only old people with underlying problems.  This is true to an extent. But this is information that is sketchy in my opinion as so many young doctors in China have succumbed. So take this information with caution. Just because you are 17 doesn’t mean you won’t potentially have issues. 

Children don’t seem to suffer that bad. This is true it seems. But there are exceptions. But for the main part your kids appear to be pretty safe. However they are little monsters that spread it everywhere. 

Masks do work. P3 P2 N95 N99 N100 (couple others I can’t recall) do work. Dental and surgical masks also have some effect. Anything around your mouth and nose will have some effect. If you don’t want to wear a mask right now. Wear a snood. Better than nothing. 

Don’t forget to buy. Latex gloves and eye masks. At some point I expect there will be people wearing all these on the tube 

When you get home take your jacket and shoes off at the door and spray them both with anti germ stuff. Obviously don’t bleach your jacket. But start now as this will be the norm soon. Festival ponchos can be just thrown away. But these are a good idea to get. I’ve got a few coming. 

When it gets really bad you may want to take clothes off at the door and dunk them in a bucket. Change into house gear.  

This is coming. You will need to isolate for a while at some point. And you will know people who contract this. This is now a certainty. Just do what you can to do to prevent it getting to you. And don’t panic. Just prepare. Do what you should and you will be fine.  

Warm weather may kill this off.  It only may kill it. We may not have warm enough summers. But right now no one can say for sure. 

Sorry if you already know this. Sorry if it scares anyone that’s not my intention but we all deserve to know what’s we’re dealing with.

 How have people been self-isolating and getting food? I started having a bit of a coughing fit this morning. Of course, it could be dust or allergies. However, it did get me thinking about ordering home deliveries instead of popping to the shops. There's no delivery slots in my area for any of the supermarkets. In this instance, when someone is living completely alone, and has no friends or family living nearby, how can they reasonably self-isolate and still manage to remain fed? Genuine question, don't bite my head off!!

 Self isolation rules???? Sneezes and sore throat Sooo I just finished my last 24 hour exam online and woke up after a 2 hour nap to a pretty irritating and scratchy sore throat and sneezed like once. It's nothing I would think twice about if I wasn't aware of covid!!!! I've been tired the last 2 days but put that down to the exam and stress 

I don't have a temperature I don't think as I'm not "hot to touch" but, without a thermometer I don't really know? 

I've got a big meeting tomorrow in person with just my boss, but have to travel on public transport to get there. 

I have checked the NHS Online and it gives the basic 3 symptoms of coronavirus &amp; obviously don't list mine. 

But I'm being told by my partner that I should self isolate and get a test because it may actually be the beginning stages of covid? 

My boss will expect me to go, and I am not sick enough to not attend if that makes sense? I also am worried about possible redundancy and my boss may not look on me favourably for not attending. 

Where do I stand on this... Do I need to stay home or can I go to work?

 very suddenly came down with symptoms that were almost gone 30 minutes later (for context, from today I'm self isolating and have notified people in my life who need to know this. I'm making this post to see if anyone else has experienced something similar)

a few days ago I started to notice asthma symptoms, stupidly I assumed that these were either down to hayfever as before this has triggered my asthma or a lot of stress and anxiety. I had no fever or any other symptoms, only fatigue (however I haven't been sleeping as much recently so just assumed it was down to that)

today I had a very weird 30 minutes or so in which I got a fever that made me feel dizzy and confused, felt stabbing pains on one side of my throat, had a weird metallic taste, my joints ached, got a bad headache, my pulse was slightly increased and I had chills. it was really sudden and basically vanished. now, I have slight asthma feelings, a slightly sore throat, very slightly aching joints and fatigue but other than that feel pretty okay.

I was just wondering if anyone else has experienced something like this: I was really surprised by just how fast I began to feel pretty awful and how fast my fever subsided (I didn't take any paracetamol). I've been practicing social distancing as much as I can (as have my family) and am 98% sure if I do have coronavirus, I was infected at college. it was unlike anything I've experienced before when coming down with a bad cold because of how okay I felt very soon after. 

does anyone think I do have the coronavirus? however well I feel in the next few days, I'm still going to continue with self isolating because I really don't want to risk infecting anyone vulnerable, I'm just really quite puzzled by how fast it happened and then vanished

 Going back to work would entail weeks away, staying in hotels, etc. I feel bad cause his business is failing but I don't want to be a part of the problem. However working in empty warehouses is fairly safe, hotels and petrol stations etc seem to be where the risk would be at.

 Neighbour acting as a surrogate Nursery Well that was suprising,

a large number of screaming kids in a neighbours garden; My theory is that there is a lot of unofficial 'Childminding' going on right now as people try and get back to work. 

Just what I have seen on my neighbourhood, looks like people are already letting children freely intermingle, have seen a few birthday parties in gardens with bouncy castles and so-on.

Adults will social distance but seems they are happy to let children intermingle; In my opinion people have unilaterally rejected the idea of meeting in a park like spies 1-1 and have started to create their own system.

Not judging as I don't have children but have been suprised by all of these extra chattering voices I can hear in the last week, the unmistakable sound of a group of children playing together and nana, mother shouting at them to behave; Sounds like the local Comprehensive playground in some of these gardens.

 Viewing houses during a pandemic There have been a few threads on here about house viewings from the perspective of current residents, but I've not seen much from people who are *attending* house viewings.

We're currently taking some tentative steps toward buying our own place, and have a couple of viewings booked in this week. I've read through the government guidance on house viewings, which mainly says only view properties if you're seriously looking to move (we are), do virtual viewings first if possible to narrow down your options (we have), and the rest of the advice is more for current residents and estate agents.

Has anyone been to view a house since the rules around home moves relaxed? In particular, anyone looking to buy rather than rent? A lot of the stuff you're normally advised to do when looking for a house to buy seems quite unwise right now, as it's mainly stuff like "spend as much time as you can in the property, turn on all the taps, open the cupboards, test the light switches" etc - basically 'contaminate as many surfaces as possible'.

Any thoughts or advice, or just insight into how the process goes at the moment, would be appreciated!

 Why can I go to work and be stood right next to people but not see my friends and family? So bit disclaimer here: I am NOT taking a stance for or against lockdown modification in this post it's a sincere question that is confusing me.

In my work there is NOT enough room to properly social distance myself from other employees. The work space we have is very long but incredibly narrow, it's barely enough to stand shoulder to shoulder with someone.

So why exactly is it okay for me to go to work and potentially infect my coworkers who may then infect vulnerable people but it's not okay for me to see my friends and family for the same reason?

 Shout out to anyone working in a higher risk environment My child was admitted to the children’s hospital yesterday (blue zone, non Covid related - clearly an excellent system worked out for even a small A&amp;E) the doctors and nurses have been truly amazing 💖, but it would have been a totally different outcome if there hadn’t also been cab drivers still prepared to drive to &amp; from the hospital.

And to the drivers that intuitively know when to drive quietly, speak candidly or tell jokes - you make a horrible situation that bit easier without even realising it. 

 It must be such a scary situation to work in higher risk environments, but it’s really appreciated and I’m so, so grateful. 

And to the driver that sorted out the security guard for me this morning because I’d left the wrist band on the ward - thank you a million times over. I was not composed enough to handle any sort of conversation/confrontation this morning and you explained everything whilst I struggled to speak. 

It was a minor thing in relative terms, but when everything feels like too much, a small act of kindness is enormous. 

So anyone who works in an essential role but feels under appreciated right now, you don’t always know just how grateful people are, or how desperately you have improved someone’s day.

Thank you. A thousand times over.

 DAE think a prolonged lockdown only benefits the privledged? Hear me out. I have 100% complied with the current lockdown. Mask and everything. And having 6-7 weeks of this has been necessary. But prolonged lockdown seems to only to be doable for the privileged. The ones who dont rely on school to feed their kids, or those with a parent who can still work. 

Or like my mom has experienced ( and me until I got out of it), abuse ( mental) from her spouse. She lives in the US and cannot go to a hotel or anything to get away from my father, who is home all day everyday now, even my dog is distressed that he is home, barking everytime he yells at her. 

This lockdown for a time has been needed. But it seems that if it goes on for months longer, it will hurt alot of people and only the privileged seem to be in favor of it lasting for ages. Am I wrong on this?

I'm not on the government list to shield but am being extremely careful as I've had a bad year health-wise.

I currently live in a houseshare in Bristol. There are 6 bedrooms but currently only one other at the house, who doesn't need to go to work. We get our shopping online and don't  go out. However, one room is empty and will soon need to be filled - the only candidate atm is a guy who will be working in an office 3 days a week and meeting about 3 members of the public a week (he's a lettings agent). One housemate is also returning on the weekend to re-start work in a workshop with 4 other people. I think it'll be a while before anyone else comes back or my current housemate needs to start work.

My Mum lives in Abergavenny, where the lockdown is still strict. I've though of going there to better isolate, but I'm not sure it's actually safer. It's harder to get online delivery, and she has to go to the shop. Abergavenny is a hotspot for the virus, whereas the South West is currently the safest place in the UK (for now - I know that is likely to change now that lockdown is relaxing in England). 

I really don't feel qualified to make this risk assessment. I don't know if anyone else is either. But on the off-chance - any tips as to where the safest place to isolate may be? Or any advice in general?

 Chinese Hygiene Have experience regarding Chinese Takeaway. I had a computer repair shop and shared the rear of the shop with a chines takeaway.
The Chinese also had the flat above the shop, they would appear at about 1pm everyday straight out of bed, no washing, no shower and wearing whatever.
They left Rice/Noodle cooked out and exposed overnight and quite happily served it without a care.
They NEVER cleaned their business, one thing I noticed a lot was the amount of grime around their light switches.
They are by nature very frugal with cleanliness. Environmental health visited regularly but due to diversity and Inclusion never highlighted it...Whenever you’re ever in a Chinese takeaway/Restaurant Just Check The light switches..it’s a reflection!

 Thoughts on the cobra meeting plan being published tomorrow? I'm curious as to whether people think tomorrow could be a turning point in shelves being emptied etc as the action plan from the cobra meeting gets published.

 Test still hasn’t arrived... Ordered a test Sunday night after symptoms. My house is full of key workers and I needed to get checked ASAP. When it arrives I must post it and wait a further 48 hours. A supposed 24 hour delivery for my test that is now almost 28 hours late... my bamboo toothbrush from amazon arrived that I ordered the same Sunday, but not a test that could stop the spread of a lethal virus... what the fuck..

EDIT: it arrived just now (36 hours later) in Amazon box. If u get symptoms order !

 Really confused about isolation instruction from high school. My son is in year 8 in the northwest and the school made the decision to test the whole student body and staff on Thursday and Friday last week. 

We were told on Friday afternoon that the school would be closed on Monday as they were waiting for the results to filter back to see the scale of the issue. 

I’ve waited all weekend for the results but not heard back, I understand the workload must be enormous. 

Today the school emailed us and said the testing so far has doubled the live cases so a decision has been made to close the school for 2 weeks and advise all children to isolate for 10 days regardless of test results as they have all inevitably come into contact with a positive case. 

As I do not have an isolation note and don’t have a positive test result my job is suggesting that I need to come to work. They’re being cagey about it but the STRONG suggestion is no isolation note- you have to come into work.

Can this be the case?  

I’m not sure about the exact rules on household mixing but even if it’s allowed in bubbles right now I don’t have a bubble so childcare is out right now if it’s not myself. 

Many parents must be faced with these issues right now and I want to be sure before I pursue it with my company.

 Furlough and new car. I'm been furloughed since the 24th March and at present have no info as to when I will return to work.

In Feb. My car was written off by a third party as I was sat at the back of stationary traffic on a motorway he failed to stop and ploughed into the back of me.

I was given a hire car while I waited for his insurance company to pay me out which the did last month but I kept the car as it was my only mode of transport and was unable to purchase another until the lockdown was lifted.

A week before the lockdown started I went and put a deposit a 2nd hand 2016 reg car from a local dealers but was unable to collect it because of the lockdown.

The local dealer are now open and are wanting me to collect the car this week but they have said i need to re sign the finance agreement as they was all cancelled when we went into lockdown.

With the uncertainty atm around work I'm reluctant to commit to the new car but the hire car company also want me to return the hire car.

Am I within my rights to keep the hire car ? 

I know I dont have to commit and re sign the finance agreement but then would I lose my deposit and they would no longer gold the car for me or if they have the deposit would they be obliged to keep it until I'm ready?

 Booked a test at 00:00, got a test on Saturday Text came through at 9:41 offering me tests at a minimum 42 miles away (I wish I was joking) between 10am and 11:30.

So the first window was 19 minutes later, 42 miles away. Good work UK government.


I managed to arrive in time for the 11:30 appointment, the process took 2 hours 10 minutes due to the queues and 2 active testing bays.

So I’ll wait to see the results, but I don’t know how they expect to scale up to 4x the volumes in 5 days.

 Medication shortages Is this likely to hit our NHS in the way of prescription medication? I'm having trouble getting hold of a heart medication- and trying to find out if there is a shortage and if it is linked to the outbreak. As there are reports the virus attacks the heart, I'm thinking maybe there is a link between the two? I can't see a place of manufacture on any packaging. Deeply concerned all this might hit us in a way I wasn't expecting. Anyone know if there is a way of finding out more about medicine shortages? I'm emailing the cardiac nurses at the hospital tomorrow to speak about this/possible alternatives, but just after other opinions 😊

 What are the wait times like at the moment for teat results? Booked in for a test tomorrow. I'm a teacher and have been sent home to isolate as I was in contact with a positive case. Would love to know how long people are waiting at the moment. Have developed a cough but have a young family. Feel like we could spread this far and wide if I have it and dont realise. Continuing to be super cautious and I am obviously isolating but feel like my kids could be spreading it all over our city!

 A request to the mods here... Could we keep the wild doomer speculation to the subs like /r/china_flu please? 

Half the stuff being posted right now is scaremongering based on papers that havent stood up to peer review.

If people want hard facts go the out /r/covid19.

The amount of people on here stating things as fact because theyve read them elsewhere without checking the scientific communities response is crazy and imo is preying on fear... a bit of fact checking goes a long way ladies and gents.

 Do I need to go to work? I’m a full time financial services worker on a temporary contract. I work in a tightly packed office (400-500 people) and really don’t feel confident going into work for obvious reasons. 

I’ve read an article online that says if I don’t have a valid reason ie. have symptoms/live with someone that does then I may face disciplinary action if I choose not to attend work.. would this be the case? 

Everything the government says right now is about distancing yourself from people so working in an office of this size is surely risky? I live with my girlfriend and she is asthmatic and wouldn’t want her to catch it from me.

Any help is appreciated!

 Would it be safe for my friend to move in with me? So I’ve been living in this house on my own for 2 weeks. I live with 3 other boys they all went back to their parents, I got sick and decided to stay in London. It’ll be two weeks on Sunday (now I’ve recovered) since the symptoms. The plan was for her to come down from our hometown (2 hours away) and stay with me until the remainder of this so she can get some space from parents and I don’t have to spend 3 months alone. I said this to a friend and he told me I shouldn’t do it and it’s made me question. Do you think this is acceptable or not?

 Please if anybody can help me My original post is here detailing my symptoms:



I called paramedics again last night and one of them said if she was me she would want to go to hospital for bloods to be done. I elected to go and I was told upon arrival that I was fine, no bloods were to be done and that I should get a taxi home. I had to locate a taxi at 4am whilst suffering just to get home.

 I'm in extreme never ending discomfort with restless legs and I'm slipping through the cracks in terms of care. I am no longer gasping for breath but I am out of breath still. 

This virus feels like it keeps hiding in my spine and comes back out to start the fever and the pains, nausea and discomfort all over again. It's been 17 days now with no help. I'm 25 with mild asthma. Something is wrong with my body. I'm scared that because I'm not 70 and gasping for breath or taking up a ventilator I'm not going to get any pallative care.  I'm going to die a slow torturous death in which this virus keeps beating me down repeatedly. I cannot eat much due to the nausea and I've passed blood. 

If anyone has any ideas please help. Please save your mocking of me. No one is believing me because I'm 25 and it's 'Just a flu' I'm not trying to scare monger I just don't want to die over a month in this torture I'd rather it end sooner.

I have been alone for 17 days now.

 WOW "South Korea, which is trying to relax physical distancing regulations, on Saturday shut down more than 2,100 clubs and bars in the capital after a new cluster of cases emerged, apparently linked to a single individual who had gone out while infected".


See how delicate handling this virus is? This comes from a country that was successful in containing it. Meanwhile in the UK, some street parties are going on with little to no social distancing....it only takes one individual to mess it all up. I'm worried that the work of  2 months of lockdown could potentially be seriously damaged....
