 Coronavirus case confirmed in my London office building. Told to carry on coming in as usual. In an office on London's South Bank, yesterday we received an email saying a visitor to our building has been diagnosed with Coronavirus.

It went on to say they have deep cleaned all areas he came into contact with and sent home 9 people he was in close contact with, so they believe the risk is very low and everyone should continue coming into the building.

What worries me is that he was diagnosed on March 3rd and we were only notified on March 9th. Additionally, the virus can live up to 2 days on indoor surfaces.

Doesn't this pose a real risk for contamination vector if 1 person happens to have picked up his virus the day after he visited and then passed it on, creating a cumulative effect. Shouldn't we (IT workers capable of ding 90% of our job from anywhere) have been told to work from home?

 Selfish people are going to end up killing a lot of people in our country.. Just last weekend the steriophonics played shows on Saturday and Sunday in Cardiff.. You couldn‚Äôt get thousands of people more closer to each other if you tried.. Said it last week but, they took the money over peoples health 100% 

Pub owners were told to shut down but instead started promoting either cheap drinks or free drinks.. ‚ÄúCome and pack the place out, we don‚Äôt care if you catch the virus and then go home and give it to someone else.. we just want your money‚Äù 

Some gym owners are doing exactly the same thing trying to get everyone from the gyms that have closed down to come and pack their place out.. Once again, ‚ÄúWe want your money and we don‚Äôt care if you get ill‚Äù 

What is it going to take for people to start following orders from the government? Do we have to reach a death toll like Italy‚Äôs for people start realising that this virus is very real and serious? I cannot believe how so many people can be this selfish and stupid. Please start doing the right thing.. it could save a lot of peoples lives, help the NHS cope a bit better and it will definitely help speed up the process of us ALL getting back to normal.

 Working in hospitality Any other hospitality workers around? How does your workplace keep up with the spread of the virus? 
Since working from home is not an option, and people are blissfully ignorant of the situation, we are packed every weekend. It's a very busy place in north-west London as well. At this point it feels like no amount of hand washing or sanitizing will be enough to prevent us from getting ill. I see people picking their teeth with their hands, and then touching every surface imaginable. It's gross, virus or not. And sick pay is a joke. Colleagues still having to work when ill, to this day, even though management promised to "handle" the situation. Stay safe and stay home guys, those of you who can, that sunday roast will be here after this whole mess is over.

 Regarding the job retention scheme (80% wages paid) Hey.

I‚Äôm seeing a lot of people not properly understanding this and spreading misinformation. So I‚Äôll highlight the key points that seem to be being overlooked.

You‚Äôre not just automatically entitled to 80% of your wages. 

You don‚Äôt apply for it, your employer does - at their discretion.

Your employer will only get the grant if they furlough you instead of laying you off or making you redundant. Furlough essentially means putting you on standby and promising to rehire you when the business opens again. 

To be able to rehire you again in the future, the company must be able to survive long enough to do so. There are cheap loans and rate cuts to help them achieve this. If the company owner doesn‚Äôt want to take on debt, and doesn‚Äôt have the cash to survive during months of not trading, it may be in their best interest to liquidate the company instead, and that‚Äôs their choice. No company = no grant.

If you‚Äôve lost your job in the past weeks, the back pay is irrelevant if the company has already been liquidated. No company = no grant.

Unless the business is confident that it will reopen and be instantly bustling with trade again, then they might not be able to rehire everyone so will have to pick who to furlough and who to lay off. Only furloughed employees will receive their wage. But this shouldn‚Äôt be an issue with zero hour contracts, since when they reopen they won‚Äôt have to give everyone hours if they don‚Äôt have enough trade, so they can just furlough all of them.


So basically your employer needs to be able to remain closed with no cash flow for at least 3 months, maybe more, and also be confident that business will pick up when they do reopen to generate enough income to be successful and pay you all again.  

If you‚Äôre employer doesn‚Äôt want to try weather the storm and take the grant, then you are laid off/redundant and should be applying for universal credit while looking for another employment.

It‚Äôs still a great package and will help so many, but it won‚Äôt just pay EVERYONE who has lost their job, and it‚Äôs completely out if you‚Äôre hands as to wether you will get it or not.

I‚Äôm not trying to piss on anyone‚Äôs bonfire, I just don‚Äôt want people thinking they are financially safe only to find they actually aren‚Äôt and could have been putting their time to use looking for another job.

 12 week isolation and schools Can anyone help give me direction with this.

I want to say firstly. This really isn‚Äôt as simple as just taking my kids out of school, that kind of action cannot be taken lightly, even in these extreme circumstances.

So I am 35, single parent to 3 kids aged 5, 7 and 9. My eldest has a diagnosis of autism and an eating disorder called ARFID. My youngest is currently seeing a wealth of professionals for assessment. They believe she has autism and ADHD, but this isn‚Äôt formally diagnosed yet. Their school is incredible and for my 2 with extra needs, routine is VITAL.

I am high risk. I would be high risk with just regular asthma but I have a rare and severe style of asthma called type 1 brittle asthma. It‚Äôs volatile and difficult to control. I do also have a weak immune system and am on immunosuppressant meds. So yeah, I really truly am high risk.

Yesterday they announced that from this weekend people who are high risk will be asked to self isolate for 12 weeks. This is explained as vital because if people like me do not take all measures to prevent infection, we are the people who will cripple the NHS. It‚Äôs not just about how I feel about my own risk and health but on the impact my illness will have on the situation in the U.K.

There is zero point in me self isolating if my kids are continuing to bring home 3 separate classes worth of germs home from school every day. 

I can only assume right now that this self isolation has to include my kids as well but I am not comfortable at all taking such severe action for THEM without some concrete guidance that actually officially says that THIS is what parents in my situation HAVE to do. 12 weeks is huge for them. To be out of school, out of routine, isolated from friends, isolated from activities etc etc. 

Now, I know that in time schools will close anyway but that doesn‚Äôt help me NOW. 

Has anyone seen anything official yet that covers this issue? Does anyone know who I can call and ask it to? I spoke to both head teachers this morning who were sympathetic but didn‚Äôt even realise that this 12 week covered such a big group of people and how many parents will be in my predicament right now. They know no more than I do.

I just need someone official to say that YES, kids will have to be out of school for 12 weeks if the parent is self isolating.

Please help

 Using public transport? My two older sons have not seen their dad since the lockdown (it takes a bus and a train to get to him) we both have younger kids and they thought it was best not to see the children

Restrictions have been lifted a bit however I‚Äôm not sure I should be jumping on a bus and train with them again? 

I don‚Äôt drive but I have said since the beginning of this if he can drive down and collect them, he can have them, but I don‚Äôt want to risk infecting both households by using public transport 

Am I being too over the top? My partner isn‚Äôt working yet but could be going back soon, if that happens I‚Äôll have to take all 4 kids with me which would mean the risking them too.

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôve just got use to the ‚Äústay at home‚Äù message or if I‚Äôm sensible about this?

He hasn‚Äôt asked to see them, he had a week where he‚Äôd call them everyday and play online games via Xbox but he‚Äôs not done much since then, just wanted to get some opinions before he mentions something

 Working from home and gaining weight. FAST. Summary
- new role after my role was put at risk
- on a full-time indepth learning course, have to finish by mid-december
- prone to anxiety
- anxiety keeps me from leaving home for a walk or cycle

During the summer, I cycled a lot to keep myself from thinking about my furlough situation, but now I'm learning in a new role, I feel like I have an ball and chain around my ankle, keeping me at my desk (+ the comfort eating!)

I block out 12:15 to 1:15 everyday in my diary to ensure I go for a walk... but I don't (because walking is too boring for me)

Anyone have any suggestions on how to deal with this? Or how to make it interesting? üòü

 Okay Vat reduced from 20% to 5%. 50% Eat out to help out vouchers for participating businesses. How much is a pint and a burger? I couldn't grasp if the slashing of Vat was for the consumer or the business? (Probably the latter.)

Probably 15% reduction in business tax and the consumer redeems a 50% voucher.

I doubt the reduction in tax will be passed onto cheaper prices across the board for the consumer?

Litmus test, how much will a beer and a burger cost in a months time eating out? - Will a group of say 4 people be able to go out and eat at half the cost, will the initial rush of people to take on this deal not make dining out a challenging and claustrophobic experience for participating businesses.

Is this not the economics of boom and bust in action?

 Instead of clapping at 8pm: Send an email to your member of parliament and demand to know how they are using the power that *YOU* gave to them to improve the lives and working conditions of our NHS and other frontline staff. 

[

If you don't know who your member of parliament is use this link to find out who they are. You can enter your constituency/postcode to find them and their contact information. Email them, tweet at them, leave them a voicemail. Inform them that they represent you, and that you want them to do better.  

Ask them if they supported cuts to the NHS year after year and if they regret that position. Ask them to use their power to create meaningful change, to transform industrial sectors for the creation of PPE, to recompense our frontline workers with danger pay and better pensions and to ensure that this can never happen again with such catastrophic magnitude. 

Standing on your front step and banging pots and pans together will not bring any change to this country. It was a beautiful moment that first week that brought everyone together and reminded us all that we are not alone in this, but now it is no more than meaningless self sevice. It is a propoganda effort to make you feel like you are helping, when you are not. It is no different than the governments campaign during WW2 to collect pots and pans to "aid the war effort" and make you feel like you were directly helping when in reality none of that metal was used.

If you want to honour our vital workers then do something. If you can't make noise in the right direction then keep your arse parked on the sofa, as that will do more good than clapping will.

 University students on placement? Hi everyone,

My uni is only stopping large lectures with 100 plus students but very much remaining open as usual. Just wondering if anyone knows what universities that have shut have done about students on placement?

I am currently on placement with the local council doing non essential work. I have friends on the same course who are in hospitals. The nurses and midwives are on placement in hospitals are also in my school.

When this gets bad, surely students can be expected to risk their health like this and continue placements?

As a household we can‚Äôt afford two people on SSP. (We can only afford one if we stop paying rent/bills, which we will have to do!)

 [NEED ADVICE] International Student being harassed! Hey there,

I am an International Student here in the UK and doing my graduation from one of the well-established universities. I reside in student accommodation provided by the university through 3rd party service provider. Our accommodation includes a living area with designated dining space and a shared kitchen.

Due to ongoing COVID-19 situation, the service provider decided to restrict the entry to living area without any prior notice. The stated that they are following the government guidelines on 'social distancing'. In a residential space? Though we endured patiently due to the intensity of the situation. A couple of weeks later, new notice was issued stating that the kitchen space can be used only by one person at a time. Now the kitchen has shared amenities like fridge, microwave, toaster, kettle, etc. What sense does this make? Again, we endured thinking that it will get back to normal once dust settles and they realise that it is illogical to apply these norms in a residential setting. Surprisingly, they did not care and just wanted to ease off their work by shutting down areas.

After two months of patience, I wrote a mail to the executive body of the service provider along with the university team. They tried to slide it under the carpet; but on constant approach, the team had no way but to respond. Now they have asked for one week to respond to what can be done about it. In the meantime, the university team (who is responsible) for the contract has not even acknowledged one mail till date. Moreover, they have started to target me and are showing bias in other key emails as well.

As we wait for an update from the service provider, university has gone missing. I wrote to the executive body of the university today; but not expecting much to be honest.

Just imagine, you being locked in you bedroom in your own home on the name of social distancing. That is what we are living! And now we are getting frustrated.

Can people with experience suggest me what to do next? Should we wait for service provider to respond? What if they do not lift the restrictions? What if there is no satisfactory support from the university? Should I write to the UK government? The high commission of my country? And can I take this up legally with a lawyer; in that case what will be the procedure and what cost will I have to bear? Above all, are we wrong here to demand freedom in our residential space where we are being caged?

All kind of suggestions welcome, since I have reached saturation point of thinking because of these frustrations.

TLDR; International student being harassed by university provided accommodation through shutting down the areas of residential space except the bedroom without any prior notice and explanation.

 Changes to the job retention scheme (JRS) Okay, house keeping.  I am furloughed.  Have been for a while.  My company is in the event space, so pretty buggered ATM.

The changes to the JRS would imply that 55-60% of the salary is to be paid for the last three months of the scheme by the government with the employer paying 20-25%.

Question 1:  Is my interpretation of the changes what you also infer?

Given the industry (events) is on it's knees, with little hope of anything worthwhile this side of 2021, my employer is saving cash where it is possible.

Question 2:  Perhaps a little selfish of me, but to extend my income as far as possible, do you think with in the changes to the scheme are thresholds of how little an employer should pay (in terms of wages) from August 1st?

Thanks.

 What's going to happen to schools/universities? At least for this upcoming school year. We have online classes - such as they are - and extensions/postponing going on as a short term solution, but what about 20/21 terms - students transitioning from school to college/university especially.

Even if there was to be an ease in lockdown restriction, I don't see parents being so eager to toss their children into a potentially contaminated environment, increasing the likelihood of pupils, teachers and the parents themselves of contracting and spreading COVID.

Universities have their own set of issues to contend with as well; higher age range, greater diversity, facility usage - not to mention accomodation. There's only so much online learning can achieve for higher learning.

I'm fortunate that my modules revolve around computing, software use, redditing and so on, but I know students on other courses aren't so lucky. Short of everybody wearing masks/gloves (if they can find them) and other precautions, are these courses in danger of being put on hold until further notice? Is it possible for a University to partially close so that the other courses continue or is that unlikely?

What are your thoughts?

 Using public transport - discussion Have taken this from the Independent live news feed - just wanted to get some thoughts in this:

- Johnson will ‚Äòencourage nation to use public transport and return to work‚Äô

Boris Johnson will reportedly encourage the public to return to their office at a Downing Street press conference on Friday.

The PM is said to be worried the economy is not recovery as quickly as hoped and will issue a more encouraging message on getting back to the office and using public transport as part a ‚Äúroad map‚Äù for the coming months, according to The Telegraph.

According to The Sun, the government is finalising a new ‚Äúgrading‚Äù system setting out the safest times of day for commuters to travel.

The newspaper also reports that Bank of England Andrew Bailey told Tory MPs about his own fears for the economy when he appeared at the 1922 committee of backbenchers last night.

He is said told have told them ministers must restore confidence in using public transport, warning that if more people did not return to their workplace, the country would be ‚Äúin a recession for a long time‚Äù 

-

I understand the need to get the economy going, but public trust in public transport has been massively damaged by this pandemic; I've worked throughout and there's been on-the-hour radio updates on commercial stations.

I know that public transport represents a far lesser risk than in March or April. I'd a holiday planned in England at the end of the month which has been cancelled due to COVID, and I'd have been making a ten hour trip from the North of Scotland to get there, and used public transport extensively while I was there.

Right now I'm not sure I'd be comfortable using it on a daily basis - how are those amongst you who are being encouraged to get back to work feeling about doing so? Or are you looking at other options?
++++++++++
 What do they know we don‚Äôt ? Or is it true incompetence ? Many of us here are flabbergasted at how this is being dealt with. Not only in the U.K. but even normally safe Canada who‚Äôve had experience with sars are pretty awful. We‚Äôve seen out Dutch American, German and French counterparts act is dismay at how things are being dealt with in their respective countries, and from what we know about this virus that dismay is well founded 


Now I don‚Äôt want to get into conspiracy. But what is it they are seeing, or doing that we can‚Äôt ? Because there is simply no rational explanation for some of the actions being taken by many governments. But I‚Äôm open to ideas because right things are looking pretty rough.

 Advice on extractor fan/vent Hi all I would really appreciate some advice. I live in a modern (7/8 year old) flat with an enclosed bathroom (no windows). There is a ceiling vent in it which I‚Äôve never paid much attention to, except that if another tenant smokes in their flat the smell comes through the vent (this happens quite regularly - I can smell weed so it‚Äôs definitely a smoker and not just cooking smoke or something).

However I‚Äôm now worried that is the vent isn‚Äôt working properly there‚Äôs a danger of infection. Perhaps it‚Äôs a low risk but it‚Äôs been worrying me. I have flagged it with the landlord (the housing association) as a possible health and safety issue but understandably they are only dealing with emergency issues at the moment so I‚Äôm not expecting a quick answer. So here‚Äôs my question:

Is there anything I can do personally - like temporarily cover the vent? Or is that a terrible idea? Are there any other devices I could use instead in the short term  to?

Apologies if this is the wrong place to post this: don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs against sub rules but I wasn‚Äôt sure where else to turn!

 Would It Be Crazy To Stock Up On Food? Hey all. I know this is a stupid question but I'm so conflicted. As a heads up, I am in South Lanarkshire so the virus may not even be close to us yet if the news is right about it.  
I've been seeing a lot of scary posts about this virus but also ones that are much more calming, like it'll be gone in a couple of months when flu seasons ends (yes I know its not 'just the flu'). I feel so conflicted and confused and am struggling to trust any media involved.  
I'm currently going through stages of bad anxiety and feeling like we need to stock up on supplies as it may get dire to which my boyfriend feels I'm over reacting. Then I will see something like it's being contained so its fine and go back to living as normal.  
Would it be crazy to start stocking up on canned and long life goods over the next couple of weeks? I'm settled on buying a small haul every week when money comes in for the next month. If nothing escalates it'll be stuff we will use anyway and if it does then we'll be in a better position. However I can't seem to shake off the feeling that I'm just being crazy and to not do anything.  
If you think its a good idea, what would you recommend to pick up?

 Will you be seeing friends in gardens? So with the new lockdown measures introduced today, we can see up to five other people in private gardens as well as outside. 

Already I‚Äôm getting messages from friends to organise get togethers, but it feels a little... wrong. Not least of all because we‚Äôve still got nearly 400 deaths today and the legislation seems very rushed and impulsive.

I want to see my friends, I‚Äôve been living on my own throughout this whole thing and feeling pretty depressed, but the thought of infecting anybody unknowingly makes me worry.

Will you be taking advantage of the new guidance?

 My nurse called me to tell me she cancelled my Asthma hospital appointment My Asthma review with my Respiratory nurse at a hospital was moved from March to May originally. My nurse called me today to see how I was doing and to confirm she had decided to move my appointment to September instead. While I am listed as vulnerable the appointment was first thing in the morning so I was willing to go (nervous about it of course) but she didn't think it was a good idea.

The appointments are to monitor my condition after being admitted to hospital last year for my asthma. To see how the new medication is working, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone else had an appointment cancelled recently? Specifically, people with a respiratory condition or listed on the vulnerable list?

 First to wear mask at work So you might remember from my rant that I have a compromised immune system. Today I wore a mask at work after getting permission from my boss. It had very mixed reaction from both people I work with and customers. I work retail at a busy petrol station. My boss was fully supportive and was surprised Iv not worn one earlier. Quite a few customers seemed really happy that I was wearing one. Declaring that if they could get one or had one they would be wearing it. Only a couple of people seemed a bit shocked by it. One refused to let me touch any of their items for fear that I actually had covid19. Over all it was a really positive response. Of course Iv spent most of the day informing people that it‚Äôs because I have a compromised immune system as per my boss‚Äôs request should anyone inquire or act rude about it. I only have a very limited supply and they are disposable. One customer even tried to offer me a lot of money if I happened to have an extra one. Everyone who has asked me where I got it from Iv told them I just got lucky. This is a small area and people talk so don‚Äôt want it getting round that my family are preppers and that‚Äôs how I happen to have one. I was really nervous to begin with as to how people might react to it but at the end of the day I need to take responsibility for my own health and not assume that everyone is clean and healthy! If your waiting for permission or for someone at work to be the first one so it‚Äôs not you then don‚Äôt. Turns out 4 other staff members are now planning on wearing ones they have bit they was all to afraid to rock the boat and do it first. Iv lost count how many people have thanked me for not being afraid to wear it and for showing people it‚Äôs not just the elderly it could/can effect and that someone else is taking it seriously. I just wanted to share my experience. Hope this helps anyone else who is trying to decide when is the right moment! X

 do you think it's safe to meet up with a friend in the UK right now? i've basically been in lockdown since march. i live with my high risk mum, so i  haven't been anywhere apart from the shops. im wondering if, in your opinion or based on your experience, it'd be alright to have my friend over? i'd have her sit at the bottom of the garden while i'm at the top with a mask on, no physical contact. just so we can talk and have a drink. idk if it'll actually happen, it's just an idea, but i miss her and even though i'm basically  a hermit i miss talking to people, too. but i'm not sure if it's just my loneliness talking or if it's actually safe to do. i really cant risk my mother, i haven't even been leaving my room just in case. have you been gathering with people, and how has it been for you if so? i hope everyone is ok, sending health and good vibes.

 Any long covid sufferers out there? My sister (21, fit but a very sickly person) likely has long covid. She took a long while to get over it, and it was a bit up and down for a few months. Since being clear of it, she's also experienced hair loss, very poor mental health, and now she has never ending migraines. 

Has anyone out there been suffering with the same and found solutions? For the migraines she's spent a day in the hospital having eye tests, and they gave her some meds at the end of last week but they're not working. 

I don't really know how to support her so I'm hoping some collective knowledge might help here. She's on a few Long Covid FB groups and says a lot of people are feeling the same way as her, so I know she's not alone in this.

 ‚ÄúGames companies of all sizes and players everywhere recognise their  exceptional dedication and hope this initiative goes some way to help  them to understand how respected and valued they are,‚Äù commented Dr Jo  Twist, CEO of Ukie.

 Military Response Info I know a lot of people have been worried about military vehicles moving around this past week and rumours were flying around about a lockdown.

My sister is part of the military COVID-19 response team, acting for the Navy. She's happy for me to share what she's been up to this week.

She got a call on Monday to go to London the next day. This wasn't expected at all. 

She spent the rest of the week listing every helpful asset the Navy has available, from the number of personnel with specific expertise like medics, to lorries that can be used for supplies. 

Finding an extra 10,000 personnel isn't easy. It's involved lots of admin, cancelling leave, relocating people etc, so all of that has been going on too. 

Now the coordinaters know what's available, it's a case of being told they need x number of people to do something and she arranges it. She's been mainly  moving COVID-19 testing kits and oxygen tanks around the country so far. 

They're at the stage where they're ready to go. They know this is going to be chaos but they're not being used a lot at the moment. Same as some hospitals saying they're strangely quiet. 

She managed to get home for the weekend and is making the most of her free time before she's working at least 12 hours a day, 7 days a week.
