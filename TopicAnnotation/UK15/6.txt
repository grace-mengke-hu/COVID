 Covid test kit post box collection times Hello I just to rush to post my test kit at a priority post box, I posted it at 17:35 and last collection is 18:30, however the instructions say to post no later than one hour before last collection, anybody know why?
I initially misread the instruction as saying to take the test no more than one hour before last collection so it arrives ‘fresh’. Now I’m worried it’ll be invalid :/

 If the government wanted people to take lockdown more serious then they should of led by example This weekend has been a farce. During my walk/exercise I’ve seen a massive increase in motor traffic over the last week. Then today was just life as normal minus pubs being open. Even a queue down the beach road. 

But who can blame them. The government never took this lockdown seriously. Late to enact it, no real enforcement and allowed a lot of businesses to carry on running. 

Let’s face it, whilst mortgage companies and landlords are still demanding payment,  council tax still still needs paying and HMRC wanting its money then people need to be working. 

The Tories failed to show this a serious issue which has meant the people have followed suit. 

I just hope we’re flattened enough so our NHS remains safe.

 Anyone else’s work re-opening their offices and ending work from home now? A few people I know are going back to the office in the next few weeks. I’m more than happy to remain working at home - I’ve saved a fortune in money and free time and really dreading the day I need to go back to that lifestyle.

 Food shopping? Could anyone shine any light as to just how much danger I'm in while food shopping? I'm 24 years old and perfectly healthy, however I live with my parents, both 63 year olds who both have minor blood pressure problems. How much am I potentially putting myself, and subsequently my parents at risk by shopping for essentials? 

Also, I don't own a mask and I feel so vulnerable without one. Should I cover my face with a scarf or is this pointless and possibly more risky than just going without anything? 

Anxiety is a bitch during these times....

 Should I apply for universal income? I lost my job today. I am not in a state where I am too screwed as I live with my parents. But I feel bad I am no longer able to contribute to the household. Should I apply is it worth it? Would it effect anything like a grant if borris gives each person some money (which I doubt he will).
