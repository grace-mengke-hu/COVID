 Rumours of people evacuating the city of Milan ahead of lockdown - trains, roads are full. Milan outbound trains are packed full of people who are said to be evacuting ahead of a lockdown. Lombardy's regional governor has described it as "a mess". But it looks like the Italian government is about to put Milan, Lombardy, Venice, Parma, Rimini &amp; surroundings under quarantine. 

Plenty of twitter posts claiming this now...
