 Where are all the Face Mask &amp; Sanitisers? Where are all the Face Mask &amp; Sanitisers?

Seeing as these are impossible to find where are they?

I had to travel in London today (by necessity) and on 4 bus trips I did not see a single face mask or anyone using sanitiser.

Lots of people openly coughing and spluttering including one bloke seriously sweating and coughing who again didn't cover his cough.

I was wearing my face mask (thank god) and wiping my hands but seriously is anyone taking this seriosly

 Will I be harassed for wearing a face mask? My mom made me a handmade mask with a filter, and is sending me some N95 masks as well. I want to wear them out, though i am not going out much these days. Will I be harassed while wearing them? Thinking of wearing sunglasses with them so I can avoid eye contact with people.

 Compulsory Masks in stores this week, how is the Retail industry implementing this? So with mask usage becoming compulsory in stores from this week, I was wondering if any of you working in retail have been provided new company policy regarding it?

For my place of work, Matalan, it is to be mandatory for staff to wear masks on the shop floor, not just tills. However where it comes to customers, we have been told that we are not to try to enforce it, nor are we to refuse service or turn customers away.

I wonder how many other companies are taking a similar 'not our place to enforce it' approach, and also how effective this new mandate will be if no one is enforcing it.

 Covid Dance Hands (jazz hands), Face (cover face), Space (make a nice wide circle with your hands), Get a test (mimic being swabbed), and self isolate (X-factor style cross arms).

 I walked past 50 people in the shopping centre and only 6 wore masks Despite the face wearing masks will be mandatory in the UK from next week, there are less people wearing masks now than
 ever! I guess the second wave will come on soon and Northampton will follow Leicester in being locked down.
++++++++++
 Why are the government not encouraging mask use? At the moment in the US if you go outside without a mask you're seen as an idiot/asshole who is a bad person for not following the simple task of wearing a face mask.

But here in the UK it is hardly talked about. Very few people in supermarkets I've been to are wearing masks. I included myself in this. I don't feel any need to wear one because there is near zero request from the government or from UK health experts to wear one.

...so what's the deal with this? Are they not that useful (as I remember reading about when this started), or is this a failure of the government to not successfully push the mask message?

 Masks should be mandatory when going for a walk, going to the beaches/parks and the gym It’s great that from next week it will finally be mandatory to wear a mask to the shops otherwise you will be turned away.

I think this should include when going for walks and when going to parks/beaches as well.

Beaches and parks are being rammed with people not wearing masks! It’s extremely hard to keep distance from others so masks should be mandatory. It’s made me not want to go back due to people not caring.

Even when just going for a walk/taking the dog out etc they should be mandatory as well! The amount of people that still walk right past me or into me is shocking. 

Plus it should be mandatory in gyms! The weight room I’m my gym is extremely small and realistically there’s not much room to distance. A bunch of sweaty people in a confined space with no face masks is asking for trouble.

Who agrees with me in regards to going for walks/beaches and parks/gym?

 What do face visors worn alone do to prevent the spread of Covid-19? I saw the labour leader Sir Kier Starmer yesterday doing a walkaround in some sort of factory wearing just a face visor. Now I'm totally on board with face coverings/masks that closely cover the nose and mouth. I have looked into the research and I am covinced they work and the more people who wear them the better in my view. 

I can also see how a face visor worn in conjuction with a face covering or mask can perhaps add an extra level of supplementary protection to the wearer and those around them. However, along with the labour leader I've seen staff in hairdressers and pubs also wear face visors but no mask. 

Only today I walked past a hairdressers and the customer was sat in the chair having hjer hair done whilst wearing a homemade cotton face covering. Yet the hairdresser who was doing her hair was wearing a face visor but no face covering/mask at all. I'm at a loss as to why so many people are having such a difficult time understanding how to reduce the risk of transmitting this virus.

Or is it me who's wrong? Is a face visor worn alone without a mask likely to make any tangible difference to the spread of Covid-19?

 Barbers and Hairdressers I've been doing some "homework" to try and get ahead of the curve like most of us here did back in January and was curious what you are doing in preparation for re-opening?

I've seen other countries are:
. No waiting area
. No magazines etc
. Appointments Only
. Hand washing before entering the premises
. gloves and masks to be worn by worker and client
. cape washed after every customer
. shop must be ventilated
. disinfect all equipment after every use
. disinfect chair after every use
. no face to face all communication done via the mirror
. no blow dryer
. No more than 20mins per customer
. Record name and number of every customer for contact tracing

I've already got a years supply of barbercide and clippercide. I have my own mask that I wear shopping that I will continue to wear in work but I'm not sure if I should buy a box of disposable masks for customers? I will be fixing hand sanitizer to the front door and exclusively using disposable capes for the time being. I built a spreadsheet already for appointments and will remove all hairdryers. Luckily only skinfades take over 20minutes so I'll just not offer them for the foreseeable..

What am I missing? What are you doing in preparation? How else can I open as safe as possible?

 Wearing cheap face masks with a beard? In Northern Ireland it looks certain that we’ll have to soon wear masks going into shops. I have a cheap reusable mask that I got in Poundland to use but I have a medium length beard (~3 inches below chin) - am I able to still wear a mask with it or will I need to shave it off?

I know some key workers had to be more or less clean shaven but they had higher quality masks, is it a lower standard when it comes to the cloth style masks?

 Face Masks Okay. I'm ranting now and I'm not even sorry

This face mask thing. 

So, first thing, I have no issue with having to wear a face mask in shops - I was doing it anyway. My problem now is the fact that the public can get fined a hundred quid for not wearing one but shop staff no longer have to wear one.

I mean. I've seen adverts saying 'I wear this to protect you. Wear yours to protect me.' and similar things. But now that everyone is wearing them suddenly shop workers are exempt.

If I'm wrong please let me know; I was just annoyed *shrug*

 Dear fellow bus riders. I see you wearing your masks, finally, and I appreciate it.

Yes, even you, NHS worker that didn't see fit to wear a mask until it was mandatory.

My only question now is "Is it REALLY so fucking hard to put it on before getting on the bus?"

Why have the thing in your hand, get on the bus, walk to your seat, put your bags down and get comfortable, and THEN put your mask on?

It takes ONE FUCKING SECOND. Just do it when you see the bus arriving. Please, and thank you.

 Wearing a mask at the barbers/hairdressers? Does anyone wear one? What are people's experiences like of going to the barbers?

Do people getting their haircut actually wear masks? Also can the barbers actually cut your hair properly with a mask?

I want to go to the barbers, but I don't want to be the only customer wearing a mask! Maybe Bojo will  say everyone will have to wear masks in shops like Scotland, then I will know everyone will wear them.

 So why do people wear their masks under their chin? Props to everyone who has been wearing masks responsibly but some people have pulled their masks down so their mouth and nose are clear. The mask sits under their chin.

What is the point of that? Do they think laser particles might fire coronavirus out of their adam's apple? Why not just not wear it?

Are employers requiring people to wear masks but not bothered about them wearing it properly?

I could understand if it were sweltering heat but this was yesterday evening in a grey Scottish evening.

 Forget about length of time washing your hands, think POO HANDS I am averagely worried about Coronavirus, but what is annoying me is that no one is talking about HOW to wash your hands, only how long for. 

I have come up with a new solution, it does not involve happy birthday. It’s called POO HANDS. 

It goes like this. Pretend your hands are covered in poo. You can be creative with this. What ever poo you want - human poo is up there, dog poo, or if you’re a vegan maybe horse poo. Cow pat could be good for visuals because you can really get those hands stuck in there. 

And then proceed to wash your hands like they are covered in poo. You wouldn’t casually be washing your hands while singing Happy Birthday to yourself. You’d really scrub them and get all into the nooks and under nails and get every tiny bit off your hands. You’d really get that soap on there and work them. Once you are satisfied the imaginary poo is no longer an issue, you can stop. 

For the more easily offended you could perhaps pretend to have bread dough hands or olive oil hands or whatever but I just don’t think it is as effective. 

If it reassures you to sing while washing your hands, you can still do this. But with this method you can sing what ever you like! You can do the whole of Bohemian Rhapsody if that makes your day better.

Good luck and God speed and remember POO HANDS. 

I have many more tips, so do let me know if you’d like to hear more.

 People with OCD (or not), how are you coping with the hygiene aspect? In my case it's sent me back about 10 years. If I go the shops, I take hand sanitizer, use that every so often, but it's when I get home into overdrive. 

Come home, wash my hands. Take my shoes off, wash hands, antibacterial wipe on my debit card, empty bags, wash hands. Put food away, wash hands. Get changed, put the clothes I was wearing outside in the wash. Wash hands.

Food items I've bought, wash hands after putting them away. 

Parcels that are delivered, wash hands after opening. Wipe down the contents of the package. Wash hands after using front door.

Walk my dog, get home wash my hands. Repeat the above re shoes and clothes. If my dog comes to play with me, or lick me, I wash hands rugby afterwards because he's been outside. 

Basically, I wash my hands a lot, and they're very chapped now. I don't know whether I'm going overboard, or if this is justified in this case?

Other people with OCD, or people without, how exactly are you coping with this?

 Do you think shops will start handing out masks before customers go inside the store?

 Do I have to give 'attention to detail' while disinfecting grocery packages? I saw some videos on YouTube about disinfecting grocery packages. Let's say, I ordered groceries online today in the morning, and they are delivered to my home in the evening (same day). 
Now let's talk about this video: 


Regarding the method of disinfecting the packages (in this video), some users made comments :---

User 'janet welch' commented---

*"Not trying to be smart, but your gloves were “contaminated” by the outer boxes of the first item.  Every item you touched after that was contaminated by those dirty gloves touching them. For instance, you picked up the milk jug with the one hand, wiped most of it with the wipe in the other hand, then changed hands so that the opposite glove grasped the handle which at that point was soiled by the contaminated glove on the first hand.  If the gloves themselves are not disinfected after each item and when changing hold of the item from one gloved hand to the other, you are recontaminating the item you just wiped."*

Another user 'sus2731' commented---

*"oh oh, all the items you "desinfected" from 4:48 to 6:29 you wipe them with the clorix but then you keep touching them with your "contaminated" hands, I say "contaminated" bcz you are touching all the "contaminated" items with the same hands, you were supposed to 1, have someone else with "clean" hands to help you hold the items or 2, use 2 wipes, one wipe to put underneath your "contaminated" hand so the dirty hand wont touch the item, and another wipe to wipe the item....🤷🏻‍♀️"*

What are your thoughts about these? Do I have to consider these things (that is said in the comments) while disinfecting grocery packages with alcohol Disinfectant (72% alcohol)?
========
(I have 72% alcohol Disinfectant. But I don't have Disinfectant wipes. I will spray the Disinfectant on tissue, then I will use the tissue to wipe)
(The packages will be delivered on the same day)
