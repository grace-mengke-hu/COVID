 Are the odds in our favour? I know nobody really knows the answer but if we work of stats/facts/numbers how bad is this likely to get? Is it inevitable or can we somehow be lucky enough to sway it unlike Spain/Italy/China etc?

I do read as much as I can re COVID 19 but there still seems to be an uncertainty of how this could unfold?

No sarky, shitty comments please as I cant be arsed reading them.

I’ve had my GP surgery and another health related appointment say they are operating over the phone currently. I think we will initiate lockdown without government enforcement.

 My manager won’t let me self isolate My boyfriend has been sent home from and was told to order an at home test kit and self isolate until he gets his results back. 

As we live together I thought that meant I had to self isolate as well, but my manager has just told me to come in and only self isolate if the results come back positive. 

Correct me but aren’t I meant to self isolate if someone else in my house is?

 So on Twitter this week I have noticed a lot of fake accounts claiming to be NHS nurses and spreading false information such as saying “masks do not work” etc. pretending they know better. This is a highlight from one such individual operating one of the fake accounts.
