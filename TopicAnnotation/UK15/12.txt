 Do you think shops will start handing out masks before customers go inside the store? Since the government has now started to advise wearing masks, just wondering if it's likely shops will start handing out disposable masks before customers enter their store, or is it will it most likely still be up to the individual to choose whether or not to wear one?

 I walked past 50 people in the shopping centre and only 6 wore masks Despite the face wearing masks will be mandatory in the UK from next week, there are less people wearing masks now than
 ever! I guess the second wave will come on soon and Northampton will follow Leicester in being locked down.

 Dear fellow bus riders. I see you wearing your masks, finally, and I appreciate it.

Yes, even you, NHS worker that didn't see fit to wear a mask until it was mandatory.

My only question now is "Is it REALLY so fucking hard to put it on before getting on the bus?"

Why have the thing in your hand, get on the bus, walk to your seat, put your bags down and get comfortable, and THEN put your mask on?

It takes ONE FUCKING SECOND. Just do it when you see the bus arriving. Please, and thank you.

 Wearing cheap face masks with a beard? In Northern Ireland it looks certain that we’ll have to soon wear masks going into shops. I have a cheap reusable mask that I got in Poundland to use but I have a medium length beard (~3 inches below chin) - am I able to still wear a mask with it or will I need to shave it off?

I know some key workers had to be more or less clean shaven but they had higher quality masks, is it a lower standard when it comes to the cloth style masks?
