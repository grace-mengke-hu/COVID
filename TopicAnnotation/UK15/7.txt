 How to get a test in these testing times? Hey Coronavirusuk Crew,

I'm in Newcastle, but I've accepted a job overseas. 72 hours before I fly I must have a negative COVID test result. This test is not covered by my future employer. What are my options — do I need to book a slot with the NHS? How? If I have to go private where can I go and how much would it cost? Thanks guys!

 Fascinating 2015 BMJ article criticising Chris Whitty for ignoring scientific advice: "UK government is criticised for “political decisions” in response to Ebola epidemic" **UK government is criticised for “political decisions” in response to Ebola epidemic**

The UK government’s decision to stop direct flights to west Africa because of the Ebola virus epidemic *was not based on science*, MPs have said, arguing that flights should be restored immediately.

A report by the Public Accounts Committee into the Department for International Development’s handling of the Ebola outbreak said that *“political decisions” had hampered the response to the epidemic.*1 The report stated, “The revocation of licences to carriers to fly direct to the region was a political decision with no basis in science and was inconsistent with World Health Organization advice.”

It went on to say that the department has since recognised that this decision caused inconvenience, adding, “In our judgment, it will inevitably have led to an increase in the costs of dealing with the outbreak and, potentially, to further loss of life.”

MPs criticised the department, as a major donor to WHO, for failing to ensure that the international community acted quickly in response to the outbreak. The department’s chief scientific officer, *Chris Whitty, admitted in evidence to the committee in December that the department “could and should have listened to and responded to the views of Médecins Sans Frontières and others on the ground who were warning of the seriousness of the outbreak.”*
