 Cases not discovered due to NHS guidelines 
This may have been covered before but not that I’ve since I’ve been following this sub. 

If you were to follow NHS 111 guidelines on COVID-19, you had all symptoms but no contact with any confirmed cases and no travel to “affected regions”, you will never be tested unless say you have been hospitalised with severe illness. Now there have been several cases of people contracting the virus in the UK with no known links to either affected areas or confirmed cases, there could be 100’s or thousands of people in the UK with the virus that simply don’t get tested this not reported. 

The NHS need to update their services to accommodate this sooner rather than later.

 They DO report the number of people tested. I have seen a fair few people lately getting upset about the testing figures as people seem to think the number of people being tested isn’t being reported, we’ll it is.

It is reported Every week in the test and trace bulletin, which I link on here.




In there it show how many people were tested, how many people tested positive for both pillar 1, pillar 2 and in total.

It gives a running line graph of those figures and also puts up the lates weeks data side by side with the previous weeks data to compare.

The latest data showed (9th-15th)

355,597 people tested total 
3953 positive 
1.11%

Previous weeks was (2nd-8th)
328,415 people tested total
3886 positive 
1.18%

The data is there and is published every Thursday, the same day the surveillance report is published.

All this was announced when they changed their testing reporting procedures a few weeks back, they announced that the people tested figure would now be included in the weekly reports.

 COVID19 positive and negative test results?? Hello!  My partner and I both tested negative for COVID19 (he is a key-worker in the military) and it gave advice to us to stay away from those who are positive and we no longer have to self-isolate for 14 days, etc.

We are both curious as to what the message has been to those testing positive for the COVID19 tests?  We would be curious to see what the text-message or email looks like, if anyone has one handy.  My partner is in and out of his workplace all the time so we are both curious as to what the advice looks like to those who tested positive.

Thanks xx

 Forced to self isolate when no contact with a confirmed case by work? Title says it all.... Here's the timeline

Thursday
Infected person (IP) is in office, I am not.

Friday
I'm in office, IP is not.
I do a test as part of the ipsos Mori testing.

No contact with IP over weekend

Monday
I'm in office, IP is not.
My results come back negative from ipsos test.
IP Does covid test

Tuesday
I'm not in office.
IP gets positive test result.
My partner does covid test as traveling in the next 72 hours

Wednesday
I'm in the office
Partners covid result is negative 
We get informed of said positive test for IP.

Work are saying all people in the office with IP on Thursday have to self isolate (obviously)
But are also saying all those in on Friday and Monday should also, meaning I have to self isolate now.

Is this right? I can't see any clear guidance on the NHS and would appreciate anyone's ideas or thoughts. (Might be not looking in the right place lol)

 ONS COVID-19 Infection Survey data shows a rise in cases 0.24% to 0.27% **tldr**; estimate of current infections rised from 136k to 148k with higher confidence (10k samples)

ONS Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey data shows a rise in cases.

* It is estimated that 0.27% of the population in England tested positive for COVID-19 (95% confidence interval: 0.17% to 0.41%).
* It is estimated 148,000 people in England were currently infected with COVID-19 (95% confidence interval: 94,000 to 222,000).

data source: [

In previous report (published 10th May) it was:

* It is estimated that 0.24% of the population in England tested positive for COVID-19 (95% confidence interval: 0.14% to 0.40%).
* It is estimated 136,000 people in England were currently infected with COVID-19 (95% confidence interval: 76,000 to 225,000).

notes:

* higher confidence since there are now 10,705 samples in study instead of 7,087
* oddly, the new data says as of the 10th May (expected 13th), previous was 9th May.

 Is the government really not testing? Looking at the thread with the latest update, I struggle to understand why people are saying the government is not testing? They did 3800+ tests today, with a positive rate of 4-5%. The number of tests is certainly not as high as South Korea's, but the positive rate is not too far from them. We are also doing much better than some other countries which have significantly more cases than us.

The change in testing criteria is one thing that people bring up too. But if they're only testing severe and critical cases, shouldn't that inflate the positive rate? If we test people with a cough and fever, I'm sure we'll get a lower positive rate. The fact that the government has changed the testing criteria and still haven't observed a significant increase in positive rate should be good news.

That doesn't we should let the government off the hook though. They should pursue contact tracing, more surveillance testing and, most importantly, proactive social distancing measures, but on the issue of testing, it appears that we are doing relatively okay.

 Question about Daily Confirmed Cases Am I correct in thinking that in the beginning of the pandemic the number of daily confirmed cases mostly comprised of those people who were most sick and who had been admitted to hospital and tested positive for coronavirus? 

And as time has gone on, and as they have tried to increase the number of daily tests performed, they have also widened the eligibility criteria for receiving a test so as health works with symptoms, for example, can get tested? And as they continue to increase the number of tests towards 100,000 in the next week I presume the proportion of  “less severe” cases - i.e cases not requiring hospitalisation - that get tested will also increase? 

If my understanding is correct, doesn’t this mean that daily confirmed cases doesn’t really provide us with any indication of how the pandemic is progressing? They should place greater emphasis on the number of daily hospitalisations, as I would imagine this curve will flatten and decrease before the death curve. (I know they do present hospitalisations at the briefings, but kind of as a secondary metric)

 I have all the symptoms and am in a vulnerable group but they won't test me! So there are several confirmed cases in the area but apparently because I personally haven't been abroad and my family don't have it I don't meet the criteria for testing. I'm self isolating but I am worried because I have suspected MS (my final consultant appointment has been cancelled because of the virus) that it may get worse than a mild case. It seems absolutely ridiculous with community transmission that you still can't get tested!? There's a drive through test centre down the road but you need an appointment :(

 When will the changes to testing criteria start to show in the numbers? I seem to remember reading a couple of days ago that PHE were changing the criteria for those that would qualify for the COVID-19 test, but I cant find anything about it now as any online search is saturated with health advice pages.

Previously, as we know, they were only testing those that had been to high risk areas and those that had come in to contact with confirmed cases. They were now going to roll out testing for anyone with symptoms that lined up with coronavirus regardless of travel history or contact tracing.

Was it today that they were beginning the expanded testing, meaning tomorrow's numbers would be the first under these conditions? Therefore should we expect a significant increase in confirmed cases tomorrow?

 Number of people recovered from COVID19 NOT-REPORTED in UK I have tried to gather this information, which would give a full understanding of the situation in any country affected by an epidemy.

UK government only reports (daily updated page here [ ) 

* total number of people resulted positive to the COVID19 test from beginning of the outbreak
   * This includes - as explained in the About tab:
      * People who are still positive
      * People who have recovered
* Daily NEW cases
   * This is basically the difference between (TOTAL-TODAY) - (TOTAL-YESTERDAY)
* Number of deaths in UK hospitals related to COVID19
* Daily number of deaths in UK hospitals related to COVID19

As the TOTAL cases is a "mash" of both infected people and people who have recovered from the virus, it would be more useful to separate the two and report, in the DAILY NEW CASES, only the difference between INFECTED PEOPLE from one day and the next

Only if we know how many people are still infected each day, we can understand if we have reached the peak or not.

Does anyone have any idea as of why UK (and US, o a certain extent) are the only two countries who don't separate, in their daily reports, the people who have recovered from the virus from the infectd ones?

P.S.

The [John Hopkins University dashboard]( shows today 446 cases of people who have recovered - It has been reporting a very similar number for quite a few days now, so I think it is a mistake, as there is no official number reported anywhere by the UK Government.

In Italy the number of [reported cases]( is clearly separating people who are currently positive from people who have been declared negative and/or are out of hospital. That is how they know that the number of people who were positive yesterday has been lower (by 20) than the number of people still positive the day before (19th April)

 How to get a test in these testing times? Hey Coronavirusuk Crew,

I'm in Newcastle, but I've accepted a job overseas. 72 hours before I fly I must have a negative COVID test result. This test is not covered by my future employer. What are my options — do I need to book a slot with the NHS? How? If I have to go private where can I go and how much would it cost? Thanks guys!

 Moderator Recruitment (2 needed) Hello Everyone, I hope you're all doing well! 

As many have brought to my attention the lack of modding in this sub has become noticeable and when only a few mods are active posts slip through and sometimes cause disruption! As of now I've added 2 New mods! But having 4 or 5 active mods may not be enough as there is nearly 30K people part of our subreddit, so I'm asking for 2 more, in the future I may ask again. 
So anyone who wants to be a mod please comment below and have a little explanation of why you want to be a mod and also include your best qualities!

 Cases bot discovered due to NHS guidelines? This may have been covered before but not that I’ve since I’ve been following this sub. 

If you were to follow NHS 111 guideline on COVID-19, you had all symptoms but no contact with any confirmed cases and no travel to “affected regions”, you will never be tested unless say you have been hospitalised with severe illness. Now there have been several cases of people contracting the virus in the UK with no known links to either affected areas or confirmed cases, there could be 100’s or thousands of people in the UK with the virus that simply don’t get tested this not reported. 

The NHS need to update their services to accommodate this sooner rather than later.

 NHS Test and Trace Statistics - 13th August to 19th August 

Hi all, the new NHS Test and Trace report have been released.

At the week ending 19th August, 442,392 people were tested for COVID-19, with 602 positive cases coming from pillar 1.

Pillar 1 positivity rate - 0.46% (down from 0.59% the previous week

Pillar 2 positivity rate - 1.76% (down from 1.94% the previous week)

Overall positivity rate - 1.38% (down from 1.53% the previous week)

Good to see the positivity rate declined again this week. Overall things seem to have plateaued but good to see we haven’t seen a sharp increase like other European countries.

Have a great week everybody!

 Is it possible to have covid19 with only very mild symptoms?  I heard that in London there is a student from KCL who is infected with covid19. From the rapid increase in the number of confirmed covid19 patients in London and UK, I feel that it is highly possible that the actual number of people with covid19 (and are out of the incubation period) far exceed the number reported.  I am thinking, is it possible to get infected with covid19 and have only mild (or no) symptoms even after the incubation period?

 NHS Test and Trace Statistics 16 July - 22 July Link - 

Hey everybody, I hope everyone is doing well. The latest test and trace report has been released and thought I’d break down some of the information.

In this week, 366,397 people were tested for coronavirus, creating an average of ~52000 people tested per day.

From this 640 tested positive in pillar 1, continuing the amount of positive tests being below 1000 for the third week in a row with this pillar.

Pillar 1 positivity rate - 0.51% (0.67 in the last report

Pillar 2 positivity rate - 1.45% (1.25 in the last report)

The weekly positivity rate as a result of this, rose very slightly to 1.13% (1.1 in the last report)


Despite the cases rising in this week, the positivity rate hasn’t increased dramatically, and part of the increase of cases is due to more testing being done. However it’ll be important to keep an eye on this, as this will show is whether we may be heading towards exponential growth.

In this report it also says we will be getting regional breakdowns of the test and trace system, giving us an indication as to whether different areas of the country are responding more to contact tracers, and if this results in a lower amount of community transmission in those areas.

Hope everyone is having a good week!

 NHS Test and Trace Weekly Statistics 30th July - 5th August Link - 

Hey everyone, hope everyone hasn’t struggled too much in the warm weather this week. The weekly test and trace statistics have been updated which gives us an idea of the amount of people being tested, and thus giving us an exact positivity percentage.

On the week ending the 5th August 438,404 people were tested for coronavirus, the most amount of people tested so far. From this 555 people tested positive in pillar 1, which continues to see a very low number of positive cases.

Pillar 1 (hospital and key workers testing) positivity rate falls to 0.4% (0.51 the week before)

Pillar 2 (community testing) positivity rate falls to 1.55% (1.67% the week before)

This brings the overall positivity rate for that week to 1.19% (1.28% the week prior)


I think we can gain a few things from this week. This is the first week for a couple of weeks where the positivity rate has not increased, despite the increase of cases being found. Due to pillar 1 only contributing 10% of cases, the majority of cases being found now are mild/asymptomatic.

I expected the positivity rate to stay flat this week; however a drop is very encouraging to see, especially due to the increase in infections that we are finding.

It’s best not to read too much into the daily reporting, as we don’t know exactly where the most testing is being done, and how many people are being tested on a weekly basis until this is updated.

Feel free to ask any questions if there are any! Have a good weekend

 Updates to COVID Tracker UK: New map feature, overall improvements Hi everyone, I  posted here a while back with the website I created for tracking coronavirus cases. Thank you all for those who used it and gave me feedback, it was quite helpful. Since then, I have implemented quite new features and some improvements, and I thought I should share again with you all:

**Website Link:**  [**

**1.  New interactive coronavirus map**

This is the main new feature since my last post. Basically, this map shows the weekly new case rates for the various local authorities in England, and displays the weekly and per-million stats.  I have also made a change in case rates function that shows blue for areas with decreasing weekly cases, and red for areas with increasing weekly cases, which you can use if you wish, but I personally found it to be rather difficult to look at. Clicking on a region also takes you to the respective chart for the region. Right now this feature is only for England, might add other areas in the future too as soon as I find out how to get the data for them...



**2. Charts for NI, Wales and Scotland**

This was highly requested, and fortunately the new beta GOV.UK coronavirus dashboard provides the API for it, so I could add them rather easily.

**3. Permalinks for charts**

You can now bookmark the charts for the areas that you want, so you no longer have to keep looking them up from the list.

**4. Graph now shows both pillar 1 and 2 data**

Not a change by me, but the GOV.UK dashboard now includes pillar 2 data too, so they are added into the charts too. I initially wanted to be able to separate these two pillars, but I'm not sure where I can get the individual data by each pillar. A new "About this data" popup is also added for those who are interested in how things are calculated/where I get my data from.

As usual, please feel free to give me more feedback! I quite enjoyed doing this website (I must have too much free time rip), so I'm still thinking of what I can add to it. My current plan for now is to add an interactive scale for the map on the upper corner, and to migrate to the new GOV.UK dashboard to fetch the coronavirus data, and maybe even add death/hospital/testing usage data too? Not too sure if that's what people want. Thanks!

 Need a sample of an NHS test result email Hi,

Hungary has just introduced two-week quarantine for travellers from the UK. I'm a filmmaker and only came to the UK for a 2-day shoot, and have to go back to Hungary tonight for more shoots. There's no need to go to quarantine if you can show a printed negative NHS test result, but I simply don't have time to visit a test site and wait for the results. I am asking for your help! If you would be so kind as to send me your test result email in a PDF or whatever format (even a screenshot would do) I would be extremely grateful. You can edit your personal details out if you want to. I will add my details in, and it will be accepted at the airport. 

TL;DR: 

Travelling back to Hungary. Can't afford to stay in quarantine there. Don't have time to visit NHS test site. Need sample of negative NHS test result email so I can edit it.

 3748 cases is the maximum cases the UK should achieve before controlling the outbreak. I expect the UK to have more new cases in a single day that the whole of China in a single day tomorrow.

1.43 billion / 80000 cases 

67 million / x

143000000x

X = 670000*80000/143000000

X = 3748 cases is the maximum cases the UK should achieve before controlling the outbreak.

So in 20 days we should have the outbreak controlled. 

We have had 6-8 weeks to prepare!

If we don't then how long before we have a no confidence vote?

 A Statement on Coronavirus in Barnsley The Director of Public Health, Julia Burrows and the Leader of the Council, Cllr Sir Stephen Houghton CBE have released a statement:

&gt; The number of cases in Barnsley is higher than the national average. We are seeing transmission in the community across the borough, and like many places across the country, have had clusters and outbreaks in a handful of care homes, schools and workplaces, as we expected would happen.

&gt; Since the beginning of the outbreak in March, Coronavirus (COVID-19) in Barnsley peaked through April and began to gradually reduce in May. Initially, this was being most closely monitored in hospital and care home settings (through Pillar One testing).
During May and June, we have also been able to monitor testing and spread out in the community (through Pillar Two testing). However, throughout this there have been two key issues in Barnsley that we are watching very closely and incorporating into our local control.

&gt; Firstly, throughout the course of the outbreak we have seen higher rates of Coronavirus (COVID-19) locally than the national average. This is related to some natural variation in the disease; our proactive and targeted testing; our higher density of care homes; and our local population which is older than the national average and has higher rates of underlying diseases and other COVID-19 risk factors such as smoking.

&gt; Secondly, we have seen a much slower reduction than the national average, such that daily cases levelled off through May and June, instead of continuing to reduce. This has been largely due to local clusters of cases including in a few care homes and workplaces.

&gt; The good news is that now these clusters have started to ease thanks to local control measures, and we are seeing the early signs of a return to the reduction in daily cases across Barnsley.

&gt; According to our most up to date data, we have seen a reduction in the number of daily new cases and in the average number of new cases for four consecutive days. We are continuing to monitor this and other data very closely, and to proactively manage the disease locally and in line with national guidance.    
This is why we do not believe at this stage any further measures will need to be implemented such as the ones seen in Leicester.  

&gt; However, it is always important to be aware that the nature of this disease means things can change quickly and the fact our rate has been high does mean that we ask for extra caution and vigilance by everyone in Barnsley.  

&gt; This is especially important in light of the further lifting of restrictions at the weekend.  
It’s so important to keep following the guidance: maintain social distance, wash your hands and wear a face covering in enclosed public spaces. Stay at home and self-isolate if you have any symptoms or have been a contact and asked to do so by NHS Test and Trace.

&gt; It is worth noting that, along with everywhere else in the country, we will also see the reporting of a lot of extra positive cases this week, which may seem concerning. Please be aware this is a result of the wider reporting of all positive tests from a wider variety of sources (Pillar Two) than was previously available. It is not about the actual number of cases increasing.
Once this information is published, we will make sure that a link is available so Barnsley residents can access this publicly available data.

 South Cumbria cases There are now 4 reported cases in South Cumbria, apparently somewhere within the national park. 

Cumbria county council and the media are refusing to give more detailed location information. Which is really frustrating as South Cumbria is clearly a massive area. They are trying to protect the tourism industry I presume.

Does anyone have any info on where exactly these cases are located? Is it a cluster now?

**Trends in daily** [**COVID-19 data**]( **for Scotland**

On 23 April 2020 there were:

* 3,009 calls to 111 and 364 calls to the Coronavirus Helpline. The number of calls to 111 includes all calls, whether or not they relate to COVID-19
* 1,489 Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS) attendances, of which 327 were for suspected COVID-19. SAS took 205 people to hospital with suspected COVID-19
* 600 people delayed in hospital. This is 1,012 less than the baseline period (04/03 weekly return). An initial target to reduce delays by 400 by the end of March and a further target of reducing by a further 500 by the end of April have now been met.
* 516 (48%) adult care homes which had lodged at least one notification for suspected COVID-19 to the Care Inspectorate. It is important to note that not all of these care homes will still have outbreaks.
* 332 of these adult care homes have reported more than one case of suspected COVID-19.
* 384 (35%) adult care homes have a current outbreak of suspected COVID-19 as at 21 April. This is a care home where at least one care home resident has exhibited symptoms during the last 14 days. This number is expected to be updated daily from 27 April onwards.
* 2,445 cumulative cases of suspected COVID-19 in care homes. This is an increase of 152 suspected cases on the previous day.
* a total of 7,567 staff, or around 4.6% of the NHS workforce, reporting as absent due to a range of reasons related to COVID-19.
* 2,271 inpatients have been discharged from hospital since the 5 March, who had been tested positive for COVID-19, up from yesterday’s total of 2,162. Around half of this increase is in NHS Fife (+54) and relates to improvements in data provision from previous days.

 Withdrawal of PHE confirmed cases page So I used to go here:  [  to get the latest numbers on cases. It was withdrawn on the 13th and hasn't been updated since the 11th.

The message on the page points to the arcgis dashboard for all the latest numbers. However, the location breakdown on the old page was a lot better, it actually listed cities as opposed to just counties on the arcgis page. I happen to live in one of the biggest counties in the UK, and I know for a fact there are cases in the city I live in, but I now have no accurate way of seeing the numbers, I only know there are 20 cases somewhere in the 1500 square miles of the county.

I'm so pissed off about this, I have a right to know how many cases are in my city so I know what steps I need to make to protect my family. Contrast this to South Korea where an app is available to give you the exact movements and locations of confirmed cases. This government is a fucking joke. If and when we get through all this I hope the Tories are well and truly done for.

 Public Health England. Not taking it serious enough? So they are trying to trace people on the flight.
Shouldn't they trace the whole flight. 

What if the confirmed case went to the toilet? 
Planes are small confined areas. 
Confirmed case coughed then touched a hand rail on way out of the aircraft? 
There's loads of conclusions. 
I think they aren't taking the correct precautionary measures. 

Here's a quite from an article. 

"Our guidance is that we only need to contact high risk contacts i.e. those in the immediate vicinity of a confirmed case which includes the 2 rows in front and the 2 rows behind a confirmed case."

 When will we see Pillar 4 test data. Pillar 4 testing is the in community testing being done to gauge the spread of the disease.  So far a lot of tests have been done and no results (AFAIK) have been published.  

Surely we need to get some idea of how many have been infected in the country.

The Pillar 2 data (key workers and families) from yesterday was 5.3% positive.  This must surely be an upper limit for the general populations level of infection since they are likely a higher risk group.

Holland tested blood donations to estimate the population spread.  I think it was 3%, but that was a few weeks ago.

How are we going to lift lockdown without community monitoring in place.

I initially misread the instruction as saying to take the test no more than one hour before last collection so it arrives ‘fresh’. Now I’m worried it’ll be invalid :/

 What's happened to the pillar 1/pillar 2 figures? Until 9th May, the [daily briefing]( had a chart for new cases that were split by pillar 1 (which, as far as I can tell was primarily the hospital cases) and pillar 2 (which is the mass testing data).

I found that far more useful than just the raw new case figures, as it made it much clearer how many of the cases are down to increased random testing.

But since in the last week, that chart has disappeared from the daily briefing. Anyone got any idea why, or whether it's still available elsewhere?

 Why continued lack of truth and clarity about testing? What is it about testing that means the government won't publish numbers of people successfully tested each day ?  i.e. test performed propertly, results back and a definitive result (might be wrong, but not 'unsure').
They just had Alok Sharmer on saying they tested 240,000 people on Monday, which is a LIE.

Please no 'they are trying their best' responses, because in this area they are not.

 Question: Gov.uk weekly test results have 0-2 cases suppressed, any suggestions as to why? I've been looking at the data on  The "About" info says this:

&gt; Source:\
&gt; Public Health England Second Generation Surveillance System (SGSS).\
&gt; Data extraction:\
&gt; Data includes lab confirmed positive cases of Coronavirus (COVID-19) reported by 15th July with specimen dates between 6th July to 12th July 2020.\
&gt; Cases from pillar 1 and pillar 2 of the Government's testing programme are included.\
&gt; Suppression:\
&gt; Numbers from 0 to 2 (inclusive) are suppressed.

The same suppression mentioned on the map appears to be being applied to the data feeds as well.

Anyone have any suggestions as to why they might have done this?

 Fascinating 2015 BMJ article criticising Chris Whitty for ignoring scientific advice: "UK government is criticised for “political decisions” in response to Ebola epidemic" **UK government is criticised for “political decisions” in response to Ebola epidemic**

The UK government’s decision to stop direct flights to west Africa because of the Ebola virus epidemic *was not based on science*, MPs have said, arguing that flights should be restored immediately.

A report by the Public Accounts Committee into the Department for International Development’s handling of the Ebola outbreak said that *“political decisions” had hampered the response to the epidemic.*1 The report stated, “The revocation of licences to carriers to fly direct to the region was a political decision with no basis in science and was inconsistent with World Health Organization advice.”

It went on to say that the department has since recognised that this decision caused inconvenience, adding, “In our judgment, it will inevitably have led to an increase in the costs of dealing with the outbreak and, potentially, to further loss of life.”

MPs criticised the department, as a major donor to WHO, for failing to ensure that the international community acted quickly in response to the outbreak. The department’s chief scientific officer, *Chris Whitty, admitted in evidence to the committee in December that the department “could and should have listened to and responded to the views of Médecins Sans Frontières and others on the ground who were warning of the seriousness of the outbreak.”*
