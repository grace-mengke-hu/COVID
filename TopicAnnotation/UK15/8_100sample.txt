 I am in Leicestershire and my friend is getting married next Saturday. She had arranged a covid wedding for 30 people; now she claims that the government has said that receptions are not allowed. I can't find any information to back this up. Can someone please clarify? I am chief bridesmaid for my friends wedding. It is my personal belief that she should postpone but alas she wants to get married soon. (They have many legitimate reasons for this).

The bride and groom were living in the lockdown zone in Leicestershire but yesterday it was confirmed that her district was allowed out starting on Monday. 

All wedding arrangements were made for Saturday 8th August. But I just recieved a panicked phone call from her stating that the government has now said that receptions are not allowed, meaning her only option now is to have 8 people in a restaurant. She also stated that this hasn't been updated on the government website yet... I cant find any information to back up this claim. I'm just wondering if anyone is more on the ball than me and can explain this?

Is it just in Leicester where receptions arent allowed?
Is she correct with this claim?
Any ideas what we should do? 

Thanks

 Supermarket concerns, same for anyone else? Just come back from the local ASDA and I notice staff have begun tearing down and pulling up the one way signs and arrows from the end shelves and floors. Thankfully the vast majority are wearing their masks, but social distancing no longer exists within the store.

Cases are rapidly increasing as Boris Johnson warns the public about a potential second wave on the horizon, so I'm really hoping shops and supermarkets aren't relaxing the rules at this crucial point in this pandemic.

 Jeremy Hunt - ‘I’m surprised we’re not moving sooner’ on coronavirus [

I was really surprised to see this as Jeremy Hunt is not just the first MP but also the first of either politician, opposition politician, official, health expert or even journalist that I have seen say this:

* questions why we are not fighting this like Hong Kong, Singapore
* basically talking about social distancing methods
* questions committing to 'the model' that the government seem so religiously attached to

Whether you like him or not (and I know Reddit hates Hunt, actually I respect him), he is the only one in public life questioning what the government are doing.
