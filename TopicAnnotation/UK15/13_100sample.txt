 What is standard treatment in the UK for non-hospitalised Covid patients? Just wondering what (if any) drugs are generally being offered early in the course of illness or is it only when bad enough for hospital that treatment starts? Know each patient will need it individualised but hearing lots about various drugs like Ivermectin or Famotidine and wondering if these (or others) were being prescribed
