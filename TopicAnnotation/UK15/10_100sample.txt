 BBC:The number of people who have died because of Covid-19 is nearly twice as high as the figure we hear announced every day &amp;#x200B;

[

&amp;#x200B;

By 1 May, the number of coronavirus deaths announced by the UK government was just over 28,000.

Looking back at death registrations filed then, the figure is higher: just under 36,000 death certificates mentioned Covid-19.

The measure preferred by statisticians, counting all deaths above what would be expected, was even higher: more than 50,000.

Each measure answers different questions.

## Why should I not rely on the government's daily figure?

Every day the Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) reports on the number of coronavirus deaths that have been reported to it across the UK.

This is the figure read out at the daily press conference, and the figure used on most international comparison sites.

But it only includes deaths of people who test positive for coronavirus.

That is fine for scientists who want to monitor patterns in the growth of the epidemic precisely: the rate of increase and time spent at the peak are useful measures, says Prof Sylvia Richardson, who is president-elect of the Royal Statistical Society and based at the University of Cambridge.

But it's a poor measure of the overall death toll because it misses people who never had a test.

When testing was largely limited to hospitals in the UK, those daily figures were missing most deaths in the community.

On top of this, different countries use different definitions.

For example, England excluded deaths outside hospitals from its daily count until a few weeks ago. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland didn't.

And Belgium includes suspected cases of coronavirus in its daily count, which makes their figures look unusually high compared to other countries.

That makes it hard to do precise like-for-like comparisons between countries, and scientists warn against reading too much into small absolute differences in these daily statistics.

When every country counts things differently, statisticians turn to a different measure - with a simpler definition.

## Looking at all deaths

If you look at all deaths in a country, irrespective of cause, you will capture the deaths missed by lab testing, the misdiagnosed deaths and the deaths caused by the strain the virus puts on our society.

Of course, you'll capture the heart attacks and car accidents that might have happened anyway.

But the total number of deaths registered in a week normally follows a predictable pattern.

It has shot up since the end of March, running far higher than the previous weeks or what would be expected at this time of year. That number has fallen in recent weeks but we're still seeing more deaths than would be expected at this time of year.

 Daily reporting of UK deaths "paused" The Secretary of State has today, 17 July, asked PHE to urgently review their estimation of daily death statistics. Currently the daily deaths measure counts all people who have tested positive for coronavirus and since died, with no cut-off between time of testing and date of death. There have been claims that the lack of cut-off may distort the current daily deaths number. We are therefore pausing the publication of the daily figure while this is resolved.

 I'm not buying this "Need to notify" excuse on deaths. Recently there's been some concern over the late reporting of deaths and as of now, early in the 26th March, still a lack of update on the government's official ArcGIS database of deaths in the UK since March 24th.

The official line is two things:

* The count does not cover a 24 hour period.
* The count does not include deaths if next of kin have not been notified.

Originally I believed the excuse that notification of next of kin must happen first before numbers can be added to the count. But why? And where is this documented? It's not in [here]( It makes sense to delay publication if that might cause distress to the relatives of the deceased, but in this case it's a report of the entire UK (or in this case England). There is no way a relative could know if someone they know in hospital is counted in that statistic. There is no way it could cause further distress than they may already be feeling.

If anyone can point us at legislation that requires notification in this instance, please link to it.

If anyone has evidence of how other countries handle this problem a link would also be appreciated.

If anyone has information on the maximum delay between a death and that death being included in the official statistics, please let us know. (Time from death that must elapse trying to find next of kin before the statistic becomes available).

It could well be true that notification is required in this instance. What I can't find is a reason why, or the legal foundation for it. Any help appreciated. Thank you.

For the first time since coronavirus deaths began in the UK, the government did not include them on its daily report of the number of cases. See the [gov.uk site](

 Confusion over numbers Can anyone explain this? I really don't understand

&amp;#x200B;

If the ONS say there are 10k or 20k more deaths than being reported by the department for health then why is this not now being registered on their daily updates? surely they should use the ONS numbers?  


If we are testing more and more people why is the number of positives stable. Surely it should be a % of the numbers tested. Otherwise it just shows that the tests are going to people who really shouldn't have to take them

Another different visualisation

[Line chart shows the number of English Covid-19 deaths in hospital from the community vs total Covid-19 hospital deaths \(includes deaths where primary residence was a care home\)](

The figures for care home are for those who died in hospital before june 12th 2020 and their death was  registered by June 20th. So its possible that more numbers may be added at a future date. I will update if figures are updated and timeline extended. 

There were 4810 who died with primary residence the care home and were registered by these dates. They make up 15.5% of all hospital covid-19 related deaths over this time and they make up 24.8% of care home residents who died with virus over this timeline

Compiled 2015-2019 weekly deaths data from ONS, created 5 year averages for all metrics shown, added in the 2018 ONS population estimates, and then calculated excess deaths in the usual fashion (remove the weeks total from the corresponding 5 year average metric).

**Non Covid-19 excess deaths** (all cause excess minus covid-19)**:**



If people are interested, I can upload all the custom data somewhere so people can utilize it themselves for their own metrics.

 Reported deaths Hey guys!

Quick question, I've noticed that over the last week, reported deaths seem to have risen again, but then when looking at charts for "actual" daily deaths, that seems to be on a steady daily decrease. Can anyone explain why this is happening? Have they started including all deaths instead of just hospital deaths in the daily updates?

 Total weekly deaths in UK Given that we can't be sure all coronavirus deaths are being properly counted, the total deaths should give a better picture.



This graph goes upto 17th April, at which point the official UK figure was 19,093 coronavirus deaths.  In contrast, if we look at the difference in total deaths from week 13 onwards, then 2020 has had 26,943 additional deaths over what would be expected by week 16 of an average year.

 NHS Weekly - In hours, OOH and 111 calls [

[

[

[

&gt;During week 7, NHS 111 calls for cold/flu, particularly in the South East and London, and calls for cough increased (figures 2, 2d &amp; 4). Please note: these data should currently be interpreted with some caution due to the national media coverage of the COVID-19 incident and the potential subsequent impact on the number of NHS 111 callers.

 Coronavirus: Almost 30,000 'excess' care homes deaths (BBC report on ONS data) I don't think this has been posted yet: a [BBC news]( story on an [ONS report]( about care home deaths.

Key points:

* Almost 30,000 more care home residents in England and Wales died during the coronavirus outbreak than during the same period in 2019
* While 20,000 mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate, another 10,000 of the excess deaths were registered to other, non-Covid, causes. Previous analysis from the ONS has suggested that many of those "non-Covid" deaths could have involved undiagnosed coronavirus
* Three-quarters of these deaths occurred within the care homes themselves and a quarter were care home residents who died in hospitals

Not mentioned in the story, but a simple calculation to do, is that this means something like **40% of all UK Coronavirus deaths have been care home residents**.

The BBC story also links to another [ONS report]( on Coronavirus in care homes (the "Vivaldi" study). An interesting thing that comes out of that is that care home residents were at higher risk where the home employed a lot of agency staff, and where staff did not receive sick pay. (I am not sure how staff could not receive sick pay; perhaps this refers to people on zero-hours contracts. I couldn't see any more explanation in the report.)
