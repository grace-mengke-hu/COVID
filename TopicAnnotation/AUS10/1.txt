 What news of Nev? Has there been any word on Nev and his financial sector cronies since Scomo basically handed them unlimited power in the form of a taskforce? Have they done anything? Are they still a thing? Why haven’t they been mentioned?

I have heard nothing ever since, and frankly that is rather concerning to me. Can anyone tell me what’s going on?

 Why are the QLD council elections going ahead? I'm currently volunteered to be a scrutineer at the upcoming QLD council elections.

I've asked the QEC what their plans are to protect polling workers and been ignored.

The candidate I am supporting has asked and was initially told "nothing was required".

That has not been updated to the candidates being requested to supply hand sanitiser for their volunteers.

Seriously? That's it?

Why is the election going ahead? They see nothing wrong with putting hundreds if not thousands of people in close proximity, touching how to vote cards, ballot papers, the local Scouts selling democracy sausages. It's a disaster waiting to happen.

I'm leaning towards pulling out as a volunteer, what's everyone else's thoughts? Am I overreacting?

 Regional/non-Melbournian Victorians, what is the state of small-medium businesses in your towns/cities/regions? Most of my Australia family live in Victoria in regional areas or along the Mornington Peninsula. In the last few weeks they've all shared similar stories that small business in their areas has been more-or-less decimated. 

My uncle works for council along the Peninsula so travels through a lot of the towns and remarked just this week about the number of empty store fronts and closed-down businesses that before lockdowns were open and going strong. Similar story out west around Ararat, and even unfortunately up in Albury in NSW. A family friend was shocked to see how many businesses have closed and moved out in the last few months, since Albury was cut off from the rest of NSW because of their proximity to Wodonga and the few Covid cases they had really early on which never got out of hand.

Are you all seeing similar things where you live?

 Waiting for Vic Press Conference to start There is a blond lady who I am assuming is a reporter or photographer that is chatting away to someone whose mask is so loose that in the span of 3 minutes her mask has slipped down and uncovered her nose 4 times . How fucking annoying

 Toilet paper situation I've seen a lot of posts of people running out of toilet paper and are worried. I'm one of them too so I'm just posting an alternative. Portable bidet. People use them post surgery also some women after giving birth. They are very cheap on eBay around $15... I'm not sure where else you can get them from. Hopefully this may help someone. Xxxx
