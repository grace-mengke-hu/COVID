 Lockdown Victoria? Hi guys we have been in lockdown for a few weeks now, does anyone have any idea when we can return to work or when restrictions will be lifted? I know what’s happening is super crazy and I don’t want to be selfish but as someone that struggles with very bad depression and anxiety the more I’m in lockdown the more I feel like I am wasting my life.

It’s so frustrating while I’m doing the right thing staying inside and buying online groceries so I don’t have to go out where as multiple people who have the infection are going out and spreading it to everyone else. 

Does anyone think we will be able to return to work in August like planned ? :(

 Was there any further clarification during the inquiry regarding why the CHO was not appointed as the state controller? According to  - "The state controller is responsible for logistics, planning and communications during a public health crisis. Under Victoria's Health Emergency Response Plan, it should be performed by the Chief Health Officer." and the premier in the same article mentioned that "And in my judgement, I think if you had a different arrangement and you were asking someone to provide both expert advice in their primary field, as well as coordination of many things that are well away from medicine and science and public health, I don't think that's the best use of the best skills." 

During the inquiry, it was quite clear that the State Controller is key to the entire outbreak happening and it definitely wasn't "well away from medicine and science and public health". I could have missed it, but was there further clarification during the inquiry on this point?

&gt;  
&gt;"If you have any symptoms, stay at home. We don't want you to come to the demonstration," Mr Gibson said. "We are going to do everything we can to make sure our event is safer."

 Anti-vaxxers deny COVID-19 pandemic, urge others to ignore isolation advice. Doctors are slamming anti-vaxxers’ advice not to self-isolate or follow social distancing measures as “dangerous and possibly illegal” after one Byron Shire anti-vaxxer claimed it was “impossible” to catch a virus.

 Concern over returning home (UK) in July I'm currently on placement in Australia (adelaide) from the UK (dorset) and am beginning to get concerned about my return in July. I have the go ahead from both work here and my home uni to return home whenever I want,  however my dilema is that I do not want to go home earlier if possible but also do not want to have to stay here past this point. How can I know if there will be a point at which I won't be allowed home? I can't find much on this on the UK government's website and am really not sure where to look.
