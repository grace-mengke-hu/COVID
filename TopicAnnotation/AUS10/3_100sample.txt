 We now have the best evidence yet that everyone develops long-term coronavirus immunity after infection — and it's not just about antibodies 


**Even patients without antibodies have virus-specific T cells**
&gt;The authors of the new study examined blood from 206 people in Sweden who had COVID-19 with varying degrees of severity. They found that regardless of whether a person had recovered from a mild or severe case, they still developed a robust T-cell response. Even coronavirus patients who did not test positive for antibodies developed memory T cells, the results showed.


**Even people who've never been exposed to the new coronavirus can have protective T cells**

&gt;Both of those previous studies yielded a more surprising finding as well: Many people who've never gotten COVID-19 seem to have memory T cells that can recognize the new coronavirus.

&gt;That was true for more than half of a cohort of 37 people in the July study and at least one-third of a group of 68 patients in the Nature study.

&gt;The likeliest explanation for these findings is a phenomenon called cross-reactivity: when T cells developed in response to another virus react to a similar but previously unknown pathogen. In this case, experts think these cross-reactive T cells likely come from previous exposure to other coronaviruses — those that cause common colds.


&gt;The authors of the new study said they detected T cells "months after infection, even in the absence of detectable circulating antibodies."

&gt;Other preliminary research published Saturday suggests that T cells not only last at least three months after coronavirus symptoms start, but in some cases also increase in number during that time.

&gt;What's more, clues gleaned from other coronaviruses, like SARS, suggest T cells' lifespan could be decades long.

&gt;The July study also looked for T cells in blood samples from 23 people who survived SARS. Sure enough, those survivors still had SARS-specific memory T cells 17 years after getting sick. Those same T cells could recognize the new coronavirus, too.

 Tips for Safely Injecting Sunlight to Cure Covid 1. Use   only pure Sunlight. This is one time where you don't want it cut down   or diluted with cheap additives like Fluorescent or LED. If you have a   vampire around, test it first on them - if they burn up, then you know   you have the good stuff.
2. Make sure it has both UVA and UVB. ASK YOUR DEALER!
3. It's okay to share needles provided you push a bit of sunshine through after each injection.
4. Studies   have shown that singing John Denver songs increases the treatment   efficacy by approximately 34%. Strangely, the song itself doesn't seem   to matter.

Expect there   to be a shortage on pure sunlight in the coming weeks or months. And   there are some states, like Washington, where it might never be   available. But there are still things you can do.

1. If   you are lucky enough to have Full Spectrum Light Bulbs, these will  work  - though it may take several bulbs. If you can fit the bulb in  your  mouth - do so and turn them on for no less than 30 minutes. If  they will  not fit, you can crush them up and ingest them; but be aware  this is  far less effective.
2. It   is difficult to collect full sunlight but blind studies have show that   one of the most effective collectors happens to be the eyes. While the   sun is fully visible, stare at it for no less than 15 minutes and  repeat  as needed.
3. Small   amounts of concentrated sunlight can be smoked with good effect. Those   who have combined sunlight with marijuana seem to particularly enjoy  the  result.

As with any Covid-19 treatment, please contact your local politician to see if it is right for you.

EDIT  1: No, refracting light through your hoarded hand sanitizer will not  increase the efficacy of the sunlight. It may, however, kill some ants  depending on how the bottles are aimed. Which, I suppose, could be  helpful if the ants are carrying Covid 19.

EDIT 2: There is no evidence that ants carry or can pass on Covid 19.

EDIT  3: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, choro tibique deseruisse te cum, probo  meliore ius id, vix munere eripuit molestie an. Accusam signiferumque  his ei.

 The psychological impact of quarantine and how to reduce it. Studies show quarantines can lead to PTSD, confusion &amp; anger. Researchers recommend reducing stressors by minimizing length of quarantine, keeping people informed and providing supplies to reduce stress and financial burden.  The December, 2019 coronavirus disease outbreak has seen many countries ask people who have potentially come into contact with the infection to isolate themselves at home or in a dedicated quarantine facility. Decisions on how to apply quarantine should be based on the best available evidence. We did a Review of the psychological impact of quarantine using three electronic databases. Of 3166 papers found, 24 are included in this Review. Most reviewed studies reported negative psychological effects including post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion, and anger. Stressors included longer quarantine duration, infection fears, frustration, boredom, inadequate supplies, inadequate information, financial loss, and stigma. Some researchers have suggested long-lasting effects. In situations where quarantine is deemed necessary, officials should quarantine individuals for no longer than required, provide clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols, and ensure sufficient supplies are provided. Appeals to altruism by reminding the public about the benefits of quarantine to wider society can be favourable.

 WARNING - WHO and Cell.com are Anti-Vax websites  (screenshot of part of the article)

The link to the article - 

It says DNA from a DNA vaccine (inserting DNA into a cell's nucleus) could integrate into the host genome and cause mutations. This is made up Anti Vax stuff.

This other website (Cell) also seems to be an Anti-Vax conspiracy website, because it says DNA vaccines integrate into the host genome and can cause mutations and cancer (it says RNA vaccines are safer because they do not integrate) 

Not sure why WHO and Cell are spreading Anti Vax misinformation like this. The most highly funded COVID vaccine right now is a DNA vaccine -

 COVID-19 Survey: Opportunity for $10 Gift Card Hi there,

I hope this is ok to post here, I appreciate you taking a moment to read and consider participating. In the world of Coronavirus, it is of the utmost importance for us to begin to understand how the virus may be affecting people from a mental health perspective. If you would like to participate in research focused on this, please see the information provided below.

\----------

We hope you are doing well during these uncertain times. We are researchers from the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs with the National Institute for Human Resilience (NIHR) and are reaching out to you to participate in an exciting study looking at the psychological changes that we are experiencing as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This pandemic can pose a threat to our sense of safety, which may lead to increased anxiety, uncertainty, loneliness, depression, and can also exacerbate preexisting mental and physical disorders. Additionally, we know that many of you may be experiencing economic hardships. Based on our experience working with survivors of trauma and natural disaster, we strongly believe that it is important to acknowledge and normalize the effects of an event like the coronavirus, which challenges our sense of safety, control, and routine.

This global pandemic is a novel experience for most individuals. For this reason, we would like to invite you to participate in our study of the effects of the coronavirus on psychological functioning. This study will be conducted entirely online and will involve an initial 30-40 minute survey for the first assessment and optional 15-20 minute follow up surveys throughout the following year. These follow-up surveys are optional, but we encourage you to participate in as many of these weekly follow-ups as possible. If you complete the initial survey and the three weekly follow-ups, you may be eligible for a $10 Amazon gift card. The first 100 respondents who complete the initial survey before June 1st and the first 50 after June 1st will receive a gift card. If you have any questions about eligibility, don’t hesitate to contact us at [brainrx@uccs.edu](mailto:brainrx@uccs.edu). We encourage both people within the United States and those living outside the United States to participate in this study.

 A new thought about how to fight cronovirus I don’t know if anyone else has had the same idea but it just comes to my realisation today that, what if instead of everyone whether are high risks or not all lockdown at home worry about getting infected , how about we just protect the more vulnerable groups and sending them to home / centres with provided life essentials etc.  My reasons are as following:

1. By protecting and lockdown the most vulnerable, the health system probably can have better capacities as those with mild symptoms would not need ICU beds and Vents. 

2. Since we don’t have a vaccine yet and given we are unlikely to eradicate the virus, which means we are probably going towards heard immunity, until eventually we have a vaccine or anti virus like any other known infectious disease. 
Therefore it is likely that at some stage we are all going to get this virus anyway. 

3. Without lockdown the majority ppl who will eventually get the virus but only with mild symptoms and do not need long medical/ hospital care, the economy is not gonna be hurting so bad, unemployment will be a lot less than now. Plus, one of the most vulnerable groups are the elderly who are not working anyway. 

The only downside is how to screen who are vulnerable to the virus. I guess we can find evidence through past cases domestic and aboard. 

welcome any comments and thoughts. 

This thought might be a side effect of me staying at home too long 😂

 Australian study: Help others by sharing your first-hand experiences of quarantine/self-isolation  

Hi everyone, I am a psychology research at the University of Western Australia. We just launched a major online survey study seeking to understand the mental health impacts of self-isolation/quarantine in Australia.

We are looking for people across Australia to share their first-hand experiences of self-isolation/quarantine, in order to fast-track the development of interventions that could help the most vulnerable members of our community safeguard their mental wellbeing during self-isolation/quarantine.

If you are currently in/about to begin self-isolation/quarantine, please consider helping others by signing-up to the [CARE Study](

This study involves daily questionnaires across the duration of your self-isolation period. Each daily surveys take less than 5 minutes, while the initial 2 surveys (registration &amp; baseline) take 15 minutes (longer, but extremely important as it captures your unique individual circumstance).

Please visit [CARE Study]( for more info. Any questions please feel free to email me at [carestudy@uwa.edu.au](mailto:carestudy@uwa.edu.au)

Also, you can hear me talk about a bit more about the study on [ABC Perth's Drive programme]( last week (which was on introverts &amp; self-isolation), I come in half-way through the 7-min segment:

 Please Read Covid19 is a wake up call. Even if it turns out it may be a bio weapon, it doesn't matter.

Fact is, it is destroyed very easily through the one thing not many ppl have.

Good hygiene.

Your best defense against this virus is to simply :

Disinfect all common surfaces and items of high use. Lightswitches, Remote Controls, Tabletops, Taps, fan switches, door handles, chairs etc etc.

Use hand sanitiser sensibly. We have been travelling amongst viruses all our lives. We come in contact with them all the time. Remember last flu season? Why wasn't there a huge media hype last year when thousands of ppl died from influenza? 

You know how some ppl think it's normal to get a flu every year or two? well its not! with simple good hygiene you can avoid most of the problems. I say most because even tho it minimizes the risk , it cannot guarantee protection against it. That's where our immune systems come in. Every year, our bodies are exposed to influenza and other virus'. Our bodies can deal with a little bit of virus. It can analyze it and fight it. But if many instances of the virus enters the body over the course of days, the person will get very sick. Virus' change the bodies cells. These cells are replaced by new, uninfected cells every so often. Many instances of this virus very quickly gives our bodies no chance to react. Too many cells get changed, we die.

In fact, getting a very small dose of a virus, gives your body a fighting chance to resist it. This is why healthy ppl can walk around infected with no symptoms. They have a small dose.

What we're seeing in the world today is countries like italy...the virus got onto the surfaces inside ppls homes. That person got infected and reinfected time and time again over days and days. They locked themselves inside infected houses.

Locking yourself in your homes can actually spread it around your house and expose you to it over and over...unless you disinfect all the surfaces. Don't lock yourself away inside a dirty house. Everyone needs to stop what they are doing, clean their houses from top to bottom and simply practice good hygiene. Remember, use too much and the virus may build up an immunity to your 'poison'. Use just enough to kill what may be there at this moment in time.

Stay healthy, and if you focus on the coronavirus too much, you may catch a different virus. ;)

 Why we should not be drawing comparisons between Italy and Australia. Some factors that may influence how the disease plays out there, compared to here    
\- We know that the elderly are at significantly greater risk of death. Italy has a significantly higher portion of their population that is aged 65 or over (22.75% compared to Australia’s 15%). You could infer from this that serious cases and deaths would be higher in Italy based upon this.

\- We know that within household transmission occurs at a greater rate than between household transmission. Italy and Australia have similar average household sizes, with Italy at 2.58 per household and Australia at 2.61. We could infer that household size will have similar impacts on R0 (rate of transmission).

\- Population density in Italy is 206 people per square kilometer. Australia’s density is 3.3 people per square kilometer. Comparing major cities, Rome CBD has a population density of 2232 people per square kilometer, while Sydney CBD has 1237 people per square kilometer. We could infer that between household transmissions might then be great in Italy than in Australia (however, noting that between household transmissions are less risk than within household transmission in general).

\- Italy has 3.18 hospital beds per 1000 people. Australia has 3.8 hospital beds per thousand people. We could infer that this would place Australia slightly above Italy in terms of our capacity to treat infected patients (this effect is greater still, when you account for our lower rates of elderly population).

\- Hypertension has shown to be the comorbidity that has the highest death rates in coronavirus. Italy has a rate of hypertension in the 18+ age group of  of 55-59% (even 11% of people age 18-35 are estimated to have hypertension there). Australia’s rate of hypertension is much lower, at 33.7% of people aged 18 and over. We can infer from this that Italy’s rates of serious cases/deaths would be greater than Australia.

\- Diabetes is the comorbidity with the second highest risk of death in coronavirus. Italy has a prevalence of diabetes of 5.3%. In comparison, Australia has a diabetes prevalence of 4.9% in the general population. We may infer from this that the effect of diabetes impacting mortality would be similar in each country, if slightly lower in Australia.

\- Heart disease is the comorbidity which shows the third highest risk of death in coronavirus. Italy has a coronary heart disease death rate of 64.95 per 100,000 people. Australia has a coronary heart disease death rate of 54.11 per 100,000 people. We could infer from this that heart disease would contribute to higher rates of serious illness and death from coronavirus in Italy, compared to Australia.

\- Italy has a population of around 60 million, while Australia has a population of around 24 million. We need to keep this is mind, as we often only hear reports coming out of countries in terms of total numbers, which can be misleading. For example, if 50% of people hypothetically were infected in Italy, the numbers reported from Italy would be 30 million confirmed cases. This is more than the population of Australia, so it would appear scary. However, if the disease acted identically here and infected 50% of Australians, our total number of infections would be 12 million, not 30 million. Therefore, the size of total numbers is quite deceptive when it’s occurring in the context of a much larger population. What is meaningful when drawing comparisons is rates of infection and death, not total numbers (and even then we must be wary because, as demonstrated above, there are vary many factors at play in different countries that will influence how the disease plays out).

Note: Please take this as my opinion/speculation, not as fact. Also keep in mind there are also very many other factors that will be at play. These are merely a few that I can lay out easily here to demonstrate the complexity of attempting to draw any comparison between countries in this situation.

 I don't get this... Alright,

I'm absolutely frustrated right now. People don't seem to be using their brains and if they did this virus would be gone by now. The way to solve this pandemic is very simple. Instead of investing billions and trillions into trying to find a vaccine that might not even work and then distributing it across the population, we should invest those same billions and trillions into creating extremely effective tests and distributing them across the population and get everyone tested. It is simple common sense. This virus is only transmitted human to human, if we test everyone definitively and isolate those with the virus away from those who don't have the virus, then the virus will be eradicated. It really is that simple. If no one is transmitting the virus, the virus will be eradicated.

Now you might say: "It will be too expensive to test the whole population" or "It's not practical" or "Our tests aren't good enough." So its too expensive, too unpractical and inefficient but providing vaccinations for the same population isn't? How does that even make sense? It will be much easier and cheaper to develop very effective tests and distribute them. We can already see the effect of testing in countries right now. South Australia for example has tested 3% of its population (which is regarded as good but really is a small sample) and there have been no new cases for the past 11 days. And that's only 3%. Imagine if we tested every single person. Its plain to see that testing is the way to go with this. It doesn't take a sixth grader to realise that if you separate everyone who has the virus from everyone who doesn't have the virus, that no one will be transmitting the virus and it will die out. It should be extremely obvious that the only way that this virus can be fought is by knowing definitively who does and who doesn't have the virus. Unless we want to continue losing lives and jobs and to live like this indefinitely, we must push for this.

 COVID-19, children, and schools: overlooked and at risk  "It is widely thought that children are much less susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection than adults and do not play a substantial role in transmission. However, emerging research suggests this perception is unfounded. Seroprevalence and contact tracing studies show children are similarly vulnerable and transmit the virus to a meaningful degree. Research suggesting otherwise is hampered by substantial bias. Additionally, large clusters in school settings have been reported, with implications for the control of community transmission. Risk-reduction strategies must be implemented in schools as a matter of urgency. "

 This led to much speculation on the cause such low death rates in Asian countries, such as younger populations, lack of obesity, vigilant infection tracking, cultural differences, genetic differences, etc. But amazingly nobody asked the obvious question: how are their treatment strategies better? Maybe that has something to do with why people aren’t dying as much there?

 Australia remarkably has a similar low death rate as the Asian countries at 0.4 per 100,000 population. That invalidates the cultural and genetic explanations. That is such an amazing result that they have 1/100th the death rates of other Western countries that you would think that doctors in the U.S. and Europe would want to know how Australian doctors are treating COVID-19 patients. But astonishingly nobody seems to be asking that question!

I found this article while trying to find what are the treatment strategies in Australia:

Clive Palmer says hydroxychloroquine contributed to Australia's low COVID-19 death rate. Is he correct?

Posted WedWednesday 20 MayMay 2020 at 6:19pm, updated ThuThursday 21 MayMay 2020 at 6:49pm


 In reading this article, while the authorities quoted poo-pooed a connection, they avoid answering the question: are Australian doctors giving HCQ as part of their preferred treatment for COVID-19?

 That is such an important question to find out in order to know how Australian doctors are treating their COVID-19 patients, why is it then like pulling teeth to find out the answer???

 Good Tips (w Sources) for living in Virus Pandemic Good daily tips for living in a Virus Pandemic



* The virus is not a living organism, but a protein molecule covered by a protective layer of lipid, which, when absorbed by the cells of the ocular, nasal or buccal mucosa, changes their genetic code. (mutation) and convert them into aggressor and multiplier cells. [source]( 
 
* Since the virus is not a living organism but a protein molecule, it is not killed, but decays on its own. The disintegration time depends on the temperature, humidity and type of material where it lies. [source]( 
 
* The virus is very fragile; the only thing that protects it is a thin outer layer of fat. That is why any soap or detergent is the best remedy, because the foam CUTS the FAT (that is why you have to rub so much: for 20 seconds or more, to make a lot of foam). [source ]( 
 
By dissolving the fat layer, the protein molecule disperses and breaks down on its own. [source ](
 
* HEAT melts fat; this is why it is so good to use water above 25 degrees Celsius for washing hands, clothes and everything. In addition, hot water makes more foam and that makes it even more useful. [source ](
 
* Alcohol or any mixture with alcohol over 70% DISSOLVES ANY FAT, especially the external lipid layer of the virus. [source]( 
 
* Any mix with 1 part bleach and 5 parts water directly dissolves the protein, breaks it down from the inside. [source]( 
 
* Oxygenated water helps long after soap, alcohol and chlorine, because peroxide dissolves the virus protein, but you have to use it pure and it hurts your skin. [source]( 
 
* BACTERICIDE AND ANTIBIOTICS ARE NOT EFFECTIVE. Naturally occurring antibodies can recognize and respond to threats in the body but taking antibiotics is not effective against virus [source]( 
 
* NEVER shake used or unused clothing, sheets or cloth. While it is glued to a porous surface, it is very inert and disintegrates only
-between 3 hours (fabric and porous),
-4 hours (copper and wood)
-24 hours (cardboard),
- 42 hours (metal) and
-72 hours (plastic).
But if you shake it or use a feather duster, the virus molecules float in the air for up to 3 hours, and can lodge in your nose.  [source ]( 
 
* The virus molecules remain very stable in external cold, or artificial as air conditioners in houses and cars. [source]( 
 
They also need moisture to stay stable, and especially darkness. Therefore, dehumidified, dry, warm and bright environments will degrade it faster. [source]( 
 
* Stanford University Researchers have discovered that exposing contaminated mask to heat for duration sanitizes them. N95 respirators have been successfully cleaned by baking them at 158F° (70C°) for 30 minutes. dials can be inconsistent use a thermometer! [source]( 
 
* The virus CANNOT go through healthy skin. [source]( 
 
* Vinegar is NOT useful because it does not break down the protective layer of fat. [source ]( 
 
* NO SPIRITS, NOR VODKA, serve. most vodka is 40% alcohol, and you need 70%. [source]( 
 
* Most mouthwashes are not effective at killing virus. Most of them are ~21% alchohol. LISTERINE Antiseptic is guaranteed to kill 99.9% of plaque causing bacteria, but will not destroy the virus. It should not be used to clean surfaces with [source]( 
 
* The more confined the space, the more concentration of the virus there can be. The more open or naturally ventilated, the less. [source]( 
 
* You have to wash your hands before and after touching mucosa, food, locks, knobs, switches, remote control, cell phone, watches, computers, desks, TV, etc. And when using the bathroom. [source ]( 

* You have to HUMIDIFY your hands after they become dry from frequent washing. dry hands can crack and virons can remain deep in these hard to reach microcracks. to HUMIDIFY hands dab them dry with a towel and then use cream or lotion [source](

 
* Also keep your NAILS SHORT so that the virus does not hide there. [source ]( 

EDIT: WEAR MASK FOR OTHERS [source](

EDIT #2: SHOP SOLO. DONT TAKE YOUR CHILDREN with you to the store  [source](

 Glen-20 for CoronaVirus Gken-20 sanitizing spray has been around for decades.

It is 60% ethanol. Does it evaporate to less than 60% before it hits the surface (which you are trying to disinfect} too quickly to be useful? Or is the concentration which hits the surface greater than 60% because most of the remaining 40% is propellant?

At $27/kg it is cheaper than hand sanitizer . What is the catch apart from it
saying **not to be used on skin**
(So they must be Is there dodgy chemicals in the remaining 40%)? There is no list of ingredients it a manufacturer name.

And there is a Coles one at half the price but the same ethanol content (+[Ortho Phenyl Phenol]( 0.10%).

 I crunched the numbers (source: The Guardian website) Am bored... Love me some data. The stats in Australia currently according to the testing data are:

- 7.7% of people who are infected require hospitalisation
- 21% of them go into ICU (1.6% of total infections)
- 38% of them need a ventilator (0.6% of total infections)
- 88% of them die (0.5% of total infections)

Victoria has the lowest rate of hospitalisation (3.4%), NT has the highest (86%). Tasmania has the lowest rate of ICU admissions of those hospitalised (10%), ACT has the highest (67%). No ventilator use in Victoria yet. No deaths in SA and NT.

 COVID-19 Attitudes and Behaviors Hi all,

I didn't see a message about moderator approval for surveys for academic research, but here is a descriptive paragraph about the research scope (more can be found on consent form). Please let me know if you have any additional questions. 

I’m a student at a US university studying psychology, specifically how psychological factors affect individuals’ health behaviors. If you have time to participate, the survey linked below asks about your attitudes and behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is a pretty comprehensive survey, taking about 20-40 minutes (time is a wide range because many questions are open-ended). As an undergrad, I wish I could compensate everyone for participation, but I'm only able to to a gift card raffle. If you complete the survey and choose to be entered, we will randomly select participants to win gift cards. **You will submit any identifiable info (email address for a gift card) through a separate link that is not tied to your responses. We're hoping to recruit a diverse and representative sample, so any help is greatly appreciated!**

Our IRB (a regulatory board that protects research participants) has required that I add the following:

A psychology research lab at Loyola University is conducting a study on adults’ **(over the age of 35)** response to the COVID-19 pandemic. If you’re interested in participating, please click the link. Please do not comment on your participation in the study or lack thereof.

 China: “how to successfully derail democratic capitalism societies, without nuclear war with these easy steps” For Dictatorships looking to rule the world, without Nukes or Obvious genocide 
Steps:
1. Make world rely on your production and increase economic strength in the process
2. Using economic strength: increase military power and scientific research
3. Research pandemic potential level viruses
4. Determine right time to release virus, once capitalist society has a high reliance on your structure
5. Release virus 
6. Await economic collapse of other societies, whilst maintaining yours under the dictatorship. 
7. When economies are vulnerable: invade/ buy (using capitalism rules) the societies up and obtain power/ control through the necessary and now easy means
8. You have now successfully controlled the world”

 MINIMUM PRACTICAL PROTECTION for Businesses and Public Workers and PUBLIC If you interact commonly with the public, PLEASE PLEASE WEAR AN EFFECTIVE MASK. The only ones proven to work are rubber sealed FULL FACE MASKS, which protect your eyes as well as your breathing orifices. Goggles are impractical as they are extremely uncomfortable to seal with, and also non-swimming ones have holes that allow for ventilation.  


The ONLY filters that properly work are rated P2 or above, cartridge based, as you do not want to take chances with evaporated viruses floating in the air. They stay there for 3 hours at a time according to a study (google it).

You can buy the 3m 6800 here with P1 or something filters

 Do we make 3-ply masks locally? Are there manufacturing operations in place to produce 3-ply masks in Australia? We soon will need masks like they do in Hong Kong, China, Singapore, Korea, Japan, etc., regardless of what the government suggests. The govt keeps saying how it's not effective in protecting against the virus, but it's certainly effective in preventing the virus from spreading. 'Healthy' individuals can still spread the virus because of asymptomatic transmission. In fact, that accounts for a large portion of community infection.
