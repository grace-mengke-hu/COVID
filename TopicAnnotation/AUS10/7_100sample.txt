 Physiotherapist Closing Private Practice Due to Corona Virus I wanted to get the general consensus on this issue.

I have closed my private Physiotherapy practice as I feel I am contributing the spread if I remain open. Although the ministry has health has advised me to stay open, I think it’s incredibly irresponsible to do so.
Mixed reviews from other Physio’s so could you guys tell me what you think?

Background: I operate out of a very busy medical centre that sees 500 patients + per day to GPs not including allied health, psychiatry and radiology. I work in a contract basis and pay the clinic a commission in every patient I see therefore i essentially have no overhead. I.e if I don’t work, I don’t make money but I don’t loose money.

My reasons are as follows:
1. Waiting room density is hard to enforce. People just don’t respect social distancing.
2. Elderly people still booking to come in for mild musculoskeletal conditions despite being told to stay home.
3. PPE supplies are low worldwide. If I continue to practice I will need to use PPE for infection control however this will ultimately take away from the frontline who will need all they can get.
4. Despite what the government says, FACE TO FACE PRIVATE PRACTICE PHYSIOTHERAPY IS NOT AN ESSENTIAL SERVICE. Same goes for podiatrist, hairdressers, nail salons, boutique shops,l etc etc. i have completely lost faith in the government response.

I am hoping Telehealth services will come online and I will continue to support my patients from a distance to give them advice and exercise management of their conditions. 

In the meantime I have expressed interest as a temporary staff in Queensland Health as I believe they will need all the help they can get on the frontline. I am young (30), healthy and my partner is a registered nurse on the frontline as well. We have no mortgage or children. This is our generations World War 3. I urge anyone in the same position as me to reach out to your state health department and express interest to help in any way you can. We the younger people are the ones who have to fight this. If you can’t help on the frontline then STAY THE FUCK HOME.

Cheers for the rant

 PSA: There will be a fair amount of home cooking. Ensure your knives are sharp and chopping boards are stable. The last thing hospitals need now are preventable lacerations. We will all be locked down at some point in time so unless you’re surviving from tinned food, we’re going to have to meal prep. Remember, you’re helping hospital staff be NOT presenting at the A&amp;E. [Stay safe in the kitchen]( to avoid burns, cuts and falls (not to mention food borne gastro).

 Masks enquiry for Teachers and Educators I work in Early Childhood Education and with the schools not shutting down, my coworkers and myself are still at work.
As you can imagine this is very frustrating as my centre doesn't have a Carpark for us to drive in and we all need to catch public transport PLUS having children attend our service. (The attendance has dropped. However, you just don't know who has been in contact with who)

By any chance would anyone know if any places are stocking or still selling masks? I have been searching but cannot seem to find any.. This is causing severe anxiety along with all other factors. 

We need to have schools and early childhood services shut! Do teachers and educators mean nothing to the government!?

 Please Sydney healthcare workers need protective gear (or at least masks)! Please Sydney healthcare workers need protective gear (or at least masks)! We are all doing the best we can. I work at a Sydney hospital that has a Covid-19 clinic. Although we are not as important as doctors or nurses, my team and I deliver meals to patients which includes entering the room of a Covid-19 patient. Some say leave the meal trolleys, others are saying roll it in - no clear management instructions or information. We have been in direct contact with patients tested positive however because the contact is deemed less than 15 minutes, none of us considered for isolation, we just fill out a form confirming we don’t have a fever. Our nurses are also concerned, as whilst they are given masks, their protective gear (raincoat) is way below standards you see in Italy or China. For the same patient - some nurses are in protective gear, some nurses are entering rooms just with a mask - again no clear protocols. We also come in contact with other patients and healthcare workers when delivering meals during on duty. Exposure to the virus without even a mask or other protective protocols on a daily basis then goes out to our community and our families–but what would we know right, we’re just kitchen/catering staff, not hospital management or politicians.

 If my spouse is ordered to self isolate Hi guys,

My spouse may have been exposed tho corvid19   Through the workplace.

If my SO is ordered to self isolate do I also have to self isolate (as well as the kids)? 

We live in a small house and spend quite a lot of time together. I honestly think we will not be able to isolate my SO in our home due to size and the fact we have a younger kid.

I called my states helpline and they were absolutely useless.

I will seek advice from dr, just wanted to get some more info prior. 

Thanks!

 What steps could an essential world take to limit exposure? Hey folks,

As the title suggests I am an "essential worker" who has to go to work outside the safety of my home everyday.

I am in a much better position than most in that I don't work in healthcare or retail and so am not in close contact with too many random people. 

Unfortunately due to the nature of my work I am forced to use trains during work and have to sometimes be around undesirables :(.

Steps I am taking:

- Wearing a P2 mask (stockpiled from bushfires)
- Driving to and from work
- Avoiding all my co-workers as much as possible (not always possible because of lunch rooms etc...)
- Spray down my workstation with methylated spirits (my homemade 75% blend) and give it a good wipe (think hot-desking every 1 hour or so).
- Wash hands/use sanitizer before eating and whenever I get the chance.

Things I'm planning on doing,

- Work late afternoon shifts (after 4PM) to avoid as much humans as possible.
- Shower and change into work clothes after shift so I minimise what I carry home.

Things I need to work on,

- Eating so much fast food. Can't trust fast food workers to be clean (no offence)

Unfortunately I am sometimes forced to share a room with fellow co-workers for a couple of hours here and there which is unavoidable. 

Any other tips? How are other essential workers managing?

 How do you ask your boss if you should go into the office? I work in a design agency and it isn't exactly essential. Despite it being an office job, our boss hasn't allowed anyone to work from home. I am only a part timer and the past two weeks have been very quiet.

How should I message my boss asking if I should go in tomorrow?

On one hand, I need money. But I know that I will be somewhat ok as I will be eligible for some of the government benefits and have some savings to tie me over for a few weeks. I am also worried if this carries on for too long (ie over the few weeks) then I will actually be broke if I don't work so I should try and work now while I can.

Is going to work at a graphic design agency a valid excuse if I am asked by police?

 Why can’t we just work together? I work as a manager of a tree planting company West of Melbourne, I’m so lucky that We’ve been able to keep working and keep some staff on.

It hurt a lot to let a few of my team go, they’re casual workers and I know that they are struggling being at home without work.
They’re good people and don’t deserve to be treated lesser because we use labour-hire services to get trees planted. I lost sleep over thinking about them.

On the other hand I’ve got some Full-time staff who were begging to be off work, to “take a vacation like the rest”. Even got some staff spewing conspiracy theories and false information... 
The sadness has gone to the backseat because anger has hopped in the front.

I’ve tried to squash this, I’ve tried to ignore it as much as possible but they just keep trying get everyone to “Wake-up” 
Anti-masks, Anti-vaccination and Anti-government. It’s starting to feel like it’s everywhere I look, people thinking that they’re medical experts or researchers that are finding the truth.

We are planting g the last of the seasons trees now, 5,000 trees making the total over the last three years 50,000 trees in my department.
We are driving and honestly trying to make the world a better place but I see all of this hate and lies and I just feel so hopeless, so empty.

Sorry for the rant...

 Woolworths workers not isolating after team member testing positive I have a friend who works at a woolies and a team member at his store has tested positive. He is worried because a girl he works with admitted to hugging the guy who tested positive and she is awaiting test results. Despite all this my friend is being told that he doesn't have to isolate or be tested unless he has symptoms. This seems ridiculous I think that everyone who potentially worked with that person should have to isolate and it's very concerning that supermarkets don't seem to care and would allow team members who came into contact with a confirmed case to keep working.

 Mask policy in NSW business I work for a contractor at a food manufacturing site in nsw, they have implemented mandatory mask policy for visitors/contractors/truck drivers who enter site. But all of their own staff are not required to wear a mask, even the security staff that provide you with the mask check temperature etc at the gate do not wear one. 

They recently had some symptomatic people that I come into close contact with get tested, but the business did not inform me that they were being tested. The stated that they were not required to unless the tests came back positive. Their own covid forms that they require us to fill out each day ask the question have we been into close contact with someone who is awaiting results, so they're aware of the potential risk they just don't require their own staff to complete these forms or wear masks. 

I've not been able to find anything googling what their obligations are relating to this or whether it is ok to enforce wearing masks on only a selection of people who enter the site. 

If anyone knows or could help me find information regarding this that would be great. 

Its a slightly tricky one as I am a contractor working on their site and also my boss does not believe in covid/is an antivaxxer so I can't rely on them to hp me too much when questioning the company.

 SBS Sydney offices forced to close after confirmed case  

SBS has closed its Sydney newsroom temporarily **after a staff member tested positive for coronavirus**.

The broadcaster said the employee last worked on March 20 and that people who had come into close contact with them had been notified.

In a statement, SBS said: "While the newsroom has been thoroughly cleaned a number of times since Friday, we have closed the area immediately for additional sanitisation, and all staff working in that area have gone home."

The infected employee is at home and "in good spirits".

SBS says it will run an "agile" version of its World News bulletin tonight.

 Why are we not pressing charges against these bosses purposefully spreading the virus to employees? I'm sickened by the news that has just come out that some bosses are ensuring that if one of their employees is infected with Coronavirus that all employees are purposefully infected to reduce the total time that the business has to close. No wonder Victorian cases are out of control.  
  
Their reasoning is that instead of the virus slowly spreading throughout the office causing frequent shut downs instead everyone is infected - the business closes for 14 days - and then everyone gets to come back to work without any worries or need to work from home anymore.  
  
This is extremely dangerous and surely is criminal to purposefully infect people. Whether they agree to it or not - it's still being done under duress. This virus can kill people and could cause long term damage to health - it's not something you should purposefully infect yourself or others with to just 'get it over with'.  
  
Why are we fining people for walking their dogs at night but not these business owners?

 Victorian Chief Health Officer advises all metropolitan Melbourne health staff to wear masks  

## Staff in all Melbourne metro services to adopt Tier 1 PPE precautions

The Department of Health and Human Services has communicated to all metropolitan Melbourne health services that it advises staff to adopt Tier 1 Personal Protective Equipment precautions in areas of the health service deemed to be of high risk, particularly where adequate social distancing is not possible.

It is also reasonable that patients also wear face coverings in this environment.

Previously Tier 1 PPE advice was only for areas of higher clinical risk such as emergency departments and intensive care units.

The new guidance is a response to the increased risk of community transmission of COVID-19 in Melbourne and is provided by the PPE taskforce and the Victorian Chief Health Officer.

 Centrelink JobSeeker hotline overloaded &amp; bouncing calls (3pm, 25th March) Just advising affected Redditors that the Centrelink JobSeeker phoneline  (132 850) is now bouncing calls seeking assistance to get a CRN/CAN  without interaction with a customer service rep.  I'm posting this because the increase in anxious people on the Services Australia Facebook page experiencing this issue has highlighted the lack of info.  Don't be stressed, do nominate for assistance via mygov.  

Relevant info:

For the past hour (2-3pm), the line has almost immediately disconnected when requesting to be transferred to an operator after following the prompts (no CDN, "something else", "customer number" and "operator").   It seems a technical fault in switching from the automated voice recognition to the queue.

A new voice message has just commenced stating that all operators are busy and requesting to call back later.  The only options provided subsequently are to transfer to the self-service hotline (which cannot be accessed at all without a CAN/CRN) or to hang up.  There are no other options.

In 12 attempts over the past hour, I've been unable to even get to a point where I am on-hold waiting for an operator.  The queue is clearly so full that they have stopped pushing new calls to hold.

I encourage everyone who requires assistance to log on to MyGov and start the clock on their benefits, as this does not require Centrelink interaction.  Most of all, don't freak out and assume it is just you.   As long as you have registered via myGov for support, you can contact Centrelink later and you will receive financial support from the date that you nominated for it on MyGov.

TL;DR:  Make sure you're registered for support on MyGov (no CRN/CAN required).  Centrelink JobSeeker phone lines are dropping calls due to overload.

 Got an idea to help but no idea who to contact So I have been thinking that a lot of skilled smart people are suddenly out of work. They are most likely right now clicking on the Centrelink website for the first time ever in their life trying to make heads or tails of things.

Why don't we take these highly educated and skilled people and repurpose them. We know in the coming weeks and months our healthcare system is going to struggle as doctors and nurses get sick less staff to be able to handle the load.

So my thoughts are as follows:
1)
Hospital are not just about care, there is a lot of paperwork, stocking, organising and general business skills required, and a lot of ex/ current doctors and nurses fill these shoes. There are people out of work today that can fill these jobs with very little training we then free up those staff to deploy them back in the field.
2)
Have people trained to do basic medical stuff, the army does this with their medics, simple field training perform basic triage. Freeing those front house people up who are better trained to help the existing staff.
3)
People skilled enough train them to be able to do basic care of hospitalised people. Existing cases checking monitors organising meds etc. Plenty of out of work people will have basic first aid skills.

With the right people this will allow for quick cross training, make people feel like they have a purpose and feel a whole lot better about themselves instead.of just taking handouts.

I am not stupid I understand how long it takes to train a doctor and a nurse. I am suggesting training people in core skills to fill the gap that is coming.

Flame away but I would rather constructive suggestions on how we could get someone to listen to instrument this. Let's show the world we come together in crisis because we are Ozzie's.

 Nursing Home Staff Not Wearing Masks My mother's nursing home in Sydney is not insisting staff wear masks. Some workers there don't realise you don't need to display symptoms to be infected and contagious. 

Is it impossible to have them legally forced by authorities to wear masks?

The average age of death from COV-19 in Italy is 81 so not wearing masks in a home here seems extremely negligent.

 Second confirmed case in the Hunter BREAKING | SECOND CONFIRMED CASE OF COVID-19 IN THE HUNTER

By

 Samantha Poate

 -

March 14, 2020

A woman in her 60s is the second person in the Hunter to be diagnosed with Coronavirus.

She’s now in isolation at home, with Hunter New England Health staff performing daily checks on her.

The female in her 60s has not travelled internationally recently and the source of her infection is still being investigated.

She received outpatient care at the Calvary Mater Newcastle Radiation Oncology Unit between March 4 and 12.

New South Wales Health says any patients or staff who are possible casual contacts are being contacted as a precaution, and the woman’s close contacts have been alerted and asked to self-isolate.

There is no connection between this COVID-19 case and the previous one from earlier in the week.

 Corona Helpline 1800 020 080 Just curious, sorry if anyone has asked this on the sub before, but has anyone used the corona hotline? I’m curious to call about symptoms I have (I have all but a fever) and I’m keen to stay at home instead of trecking it out to a doctor / the outdoors while sick. 
Thanks

 Update: My experience of going to the doctors in hopes to be tested So as per my recent post where my work wanted me to be tested due to some troubling symptoms, here is an update. 



Yesterday I called 13HEALTH. They put me through to their Coronavirus phone line. Put simply I was asked if I’d travelled internationally in the last 14 days, or if I had up to 15 minutes of close contact with a known positive case in the last 14 days. 



I asked him why was that relevant? (I’m aware we have a shortage on tests and this is why the criteria is so strict[shitbrained])



It’s in the community, it’s spread asymptomatically, it’s spread via aerosol, it’s spread through surfaces. Travel, direct contact and known contact are all void points for needing to be tested. This is figure one on why we are fucked. 



I was then referred to make an appointment to my GP. I was advised due to my circumstance that I call when I arrive and they’ll advise me on what to do. I was cautious not to be around others so my appointment was 6pm. I called as I was asked to do the lady freaked out and told me to go to a “fever clinic”. I explained that I was told by the Coronavirus phoneline to see my gp. The moment she realised I hadn’t travelled she said oh no worries! Come in. No precaution was taken and I was suddenly all sweet to waltz on in. This is figure two on why we are fucked. 



luckily no others were there. 



My doctor was remarkably nonchalant about the whole thing. “The chances you have covid19 are slim to none” he exclaimed confidently. Here, people we observe figure three on why we are fucked. 


He asked me my symptoms. My symptoms have been, dry irratible throat, incessant (cunty) dry, nonproductive cough, pain in my chest and back, transient fever, general malaise. He checked my blood pressure, listened to my lungs, took my temperature etc. all without any form of PPE (granted he probably didn’t have any, poor bugger) figure four on why we are fucked. 



He said he’s happy for me to go, says I have an “unrelated” infection, gave me a med certificate saying I can’t work tomorrow, good to work after that date and I’m free to go. Figure five on why we are fucked. 



Now what am I to do? I feel absolute rubbish, my boss is satisfied with my doctors decision and now I have the burden of not knowing. Do I go to work as per my bosses request and potentially get this party started in SEQLD? Do I disregard my boss and doctors recommendations be proactive for the better of others and potentially save lives? 



I’m a casual with no money. It’s not like I don’t want to work I **need** to work. This is fucking ridiculous. Obviously I would rather not go to work if it means I can prevent this shit from spreading - I may not even have it **but I don’t know for sure because I can’t be fucking tested**

 2 weeks from today We all wake up Saturday morning and turn our TVs on. 

All news channels: "Residents are being urged to remain inside their homes as Australian doctors, scientists and researchers are strongly recommending all individuals to quarantine themselves for a minimum of 2 weeks. All non-essential and essential medical staff and government services will continue duties as per usual. Businesses will begin to operate normally in 2 weeks. 

Please preserve the country's water and ration any food you have. If you would like to purchase food and any other required items, please visit the following websites to purchase and they will be delivered safely to your door."

\^ I do not see why something like this is outside the realm of possibility? Am I being crazy or is everyone just afraid of the truth?

 ABC News had great footage of some creative mask fittings this morning The footage of people lining up at a fever clinic was an eye opener. Why go to the effort of acquiring a mask and scooting off to the ED if you can’t be bothered to check if it’s on the right way! 

The one with the mask resting across their mouth, completely flat fresh out the box had me chuckle.

 Going back to casual work? I'm 16 and work at McDonald's in south-western Sydney. I haven't worked since March. I checked my work roster today and I'm scheduled for work next Sunday. 

So my question is, what do you guys think? Should I go in? I'm nervous about potentially catching COVID and passing it onto my parents (mid 40s-50s and one's a heavy smoker). However, some things to note:

* I've been going back to school for 3 days/week
* My sister is going 5 days/week
* My mum goes out shopping every so often

Therefore isn't the risk of me catching it still the same considering there are more people at school anyways? The prospect of money is (obviously) enticing to me but I'm not sure if some 50 odd dollars is going to be worth the risk, that is, if there is any. Please help!

 Please consider writing to your premier and the PM Hi,
I’m a teacher in NSW and I don’t feel safe at work. Unlike nurses and Drs I do not have training in how to stay safe from this virus. I work at a special school and I am regularly coughed on and touched by students, many of whom are non-verbal. 
I have worked as a teacher for the last 10 years and have a permanent job, yet I am considering resigning if something doesn’t happen soon. This would put me under considerable strain as I am a solo mother. I rely on grandparents in their late 70s so if I work we can’t see them and my brother who is terminally ill. 

Please consider writing to the PM or your premier via the contact section of their page if you are concerned about teachers. Many of my colleagues are 60+ and have underlying health conditions. I work with a lady who is currently undergoing chemo. How are these people going to keep coming to school, knowing that if they get infected they stand a good chance of dying? 

I do not have training in how to prevent virus spread. I don’t have hand sanitiser or wipes as we have run out. I certainly didn’t sign up to be on the front line of a pandemic when I became a teacher ten years ago.

I will put the contact links for the PM and Premiers in the comments below. Please consider supporting me and many other teachers who do not feel safe. 

Thank you

 Unable to work from home - working in IT Melbourne Hi guys, I work for an IT company in the heart of Melbourne. I raised my concerns with my boss discussing feasibility to work from home on an ongoing basis (due to my crippling anxiety regarding the corona virus). However they responded with only if you've come in contact with someone exposed to the corona virus will you be able to work from home, with a quarantine period of 14 days.

How ridiculous is this. I work in IT which has full capacity to get all employees to work from home, however they remain stubborn and insist on enforcing everyone to continue working in the office. I have also proven that I can work from home effectively. Is anyone else having this problem? Can anyone give me advice on how I can convince them working from home is a good idea?

 AFR reveals vic restrictions from draft obtained. Construction sites, manufacturing plants, car dealerships and the majority of retail stores are set to be closed under the stage four restrictions poised to devastate the Victorian economy.

A draft document obtained by The Australian Financial Review sets out the huge numbers of businesses set to be shut from midnight Monday and the select few allowed to remain open as the Premier Daniel Andrews ramps up efforts to control the coronavirus outbreak.

Under the classifications in the document there are only three types of construction that will be allowed to continue: residential construction that is already underway, construction of critical infrastructure and infrastructure connected to essential services.

Workers at the Laverton North warehouse on Monday. Examples of construction sites that will be closed for business are residential building sites yet to open, non-residential building construction, heavy and civil engineering projects.

The new classifications also orders the majority of the state's retailers to bring the shutters down with car dealerships, furniture stores, retail hardware stores, electrical goods stores, department stores, florists, clothing stores, antique stores, food courts, auction houses and sex shops to close.

Retailers allowed to remain open include supermarkets, grocery shops, service stations, pharmacists, post offices, drive-through agricultural retailers and hardware stores that cater to permitted services or industries.

The document also puts a number of wholesale businesses into the column of businesses to be closed including motor vehicle sales, motor vehicle parts retailers, furniture, floor covering and other homeware wholesalers. Wholesalers that can remain open include grocery, liquor and tobacco businesses and wholesalers of cereal grains.

Under the new restrictions, businesses wanting to continue operating will need to seek a special exemption from Victoria's chief health officer.

Manufacturers of goods that "would, if not exempted, otherwise permanently close and create a major supply chain gap" or be "critical to global supply chains in the local and international manufacture of essential products overseas, such as medical equipment and supplies" will be exempted. So will businesses trading as sole operators.

Mining support services and exploration in Victoria will also be required to close with exemptions for coal, oil, gas, metal ore, petroleum, non-metallic mineral mining and quarrying.

For the financial services industry, only retail banking and the provision of banking services to those unable to access online services will be permitted. Financing, investing, insurance funds, superannuation funds and auxiliary finance and insurance services will be forced to close.

It is understood the finance industry was seeking greater clarity from the Victorian State Government on its interpretation of retail banking and the provision of retail banking services, after a similar ban in New Zealand saw some contractors such as security staff who oversee the maintenance of ATMs stopped at road blocks.

In the telecommunications and media sector book publishers, directory businesses, mailing list and software publishers are required to close while telecommunication services, newspaper production, radio and television braodcasting will be allowed to continue.

 Inability to test is putting a lot of people at risk! My husband is a care worker for people with disabilities and I'm a teacher.
The other week, one of my husband's collegues tested positive for covid19. My husband didn't work with him. But he does work with someone who works with him. That person is now also off sick, being tested for Covid19 but hasn't got his tests back as it takes around 5 days. My husband is now coughing and sick. The first time he went to a doctor he was told "come back on Monday (3 days later) if you're still sick." so he did. But they cannot rest him as he hasn't had direct contact with someone who has tested positive (yet). My colleague is in the same boat. She has had a fever and dry cough for about a week now, has seen doctor twice but can't get tested as she hasn't had contact with a confirmed case or traveler. For all I know, I could be a carrier right now, but still have to go to my job every day at school. All because I can't know, because no one can get tested... 😞

 [NSW] Public health alert –– get tested and isolate until 14 days after you were at the Crossroad Hotel [12 July 2020 - NSW Health media release](

NSW Health is urging anyone who attended the Crossroads Hotel at Casula between Friday 3 July and Friday 10 July to: 

 - immediately self-isolate until 14 days after they were last there
 - attend a clinic for testing even if they have no symptoms
 - watch for symptoms and get retested should any respiratory symptoms occur
​ - even if you get a negative test stay in isolation for 14 days.

The warning follows confirmation of an additional four cases of COVID-19 directly linked to the hotel.

The cases include: 

- a South Western Sydney teenager who worked at the hotel on several days including 3 July
 - a close contact of this worker, a South Western Sydney woman in her 50s
 - a South Western Sydney woman in her 40s who had dinner at the hotel on 3 July
 - A Victorian man in his 20s who had dinner at the hotel on 3 July

These four are in addition to the five previously reported cases in a woman in her 30s from South Western Sydney and a man in his 50s from the Blue Mountains who had dinner at the hotel on 3 July. This man’s three household contacts have also been confirmed as positive for COVID-19.

The total number of cases linked to the hotel is nine.

None of these cases appear likely to have been the source of infection at the hotel.
NSW Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant said anyone who either worked or visited the Crossroads Hotel from 3-10 July should isolate themselves for 14 days after they were last at the hotel, regardless of symptoms or test results, and be tested even if they are not displaying any symptoms.

“If you were at the Crossroads Hotel between 3 and 10 July you may be at risk of infection and you must isolate yourself to avoid spreading COVID-19 to others.

“While investigations are continuing, it is vital people get tested so we can try and establish the source of infection at the hotel. I encourage people to access a number of clinics at local hospitals at Campbelltown, Fairfield and Liverpool so people are tested as quickly as possible, Dr Chant said.
Additional staff have been deployed to the pop-up clinic at the Crossroads Hotel to expedite those people who wish to be tested there.

Testing is available at Liverpool, Campbelltown and Fairfield Hospitals at these [testing locations](

Testing is also available through GP clinics.

The pop-up clinic in the carpark of the Crossroads Hotel is open until 5pm today. As this clinic is quite busy, people are asked to be patient and attend the other clinics where possible.

It’s essential that we all take the risk of transmission very seriously and take steps to protect ourselves and loved ones:
 - If you have even mild symptoms, a cold or cough, get tested and stay home until you’re cleared.
 - Keep your distance from others at all times even if you are well.
 - If you have been in Victoria, don’t mix with other people until two weeks has passed.

People who work in high-risk settings such as health care facilities or aged care homes must not to attend work if they have symptoms and must get tested immediately. People should also not visit relatives in these settings if they have even the mildest of symptoms or have recently returned from Victoria.

 Required hospital treatments during this period A family member is high risk has an autoimmune disease (myasthenia gravis) and requires 4 weekly infusions in hospital. They take half a day or more. This is necessary for the management of the disease.

I spoke with the nurse and they are not tested, possibly still in the same room with other people receiving treatment and not sure about masks. The nurses however apparently aren’t rotated throughout the hospital now and they’ve been moved to the private. I asked about the alternatives and there aren’t any aside from getting a nurse in privately. 

Now obviously this is risky but I just don’t know any other way around it. I only have two masks and can send one in with him, and goggles I suppose. What else can I do? There’s no guarantee the nurses haven’t been on public transport or the furniture has been sterilized since the last person used it...

 Manufacturing and Construction Hi guys. So I'm in Vic and they just announced the new changes to workplaces. I work as a service tech in the windows and doors industry and just trying to grasp how this affects me and our industry. As it stands I usually travel to 4-5 different sites daily completing repair work, installs etc. From what I gather after reading the workplace changes pdf, if I fall under manufacturing it says "Single site only, no site hopping". If i look under construction it says 1 site for the 6 week lockdown period. So my understanding is that I am unable to do service work? Yet my boss thinks we are all good. Full steam ahead. I just think travelling all over melb every day sort of goes against the whole stage 4 principle of minimizing travel etc. If anyone could assist that would be great.

 Workplace has banned ppe masks and gloves. No hand sanitiser available. Don't even mention it in store. What can I do? Who can I report this to? I work for Ikea, I won't say which one. But I came in with a mask a few days ago to protect myself and my family. Upon walking in, I was approached by managers who said that we are not allowed to wear such things in store because it promotes fear. The same with latex protective gloves. There's not even a fricken bottle of dettol spray and wipe!? 
I'm so shocked and quiet litterally sickened that a store would put its staff at risk they way they are. I've noticed folks coming in and around the store coughing and sneezing, and handling items that we are required to touch with bare hands to reorganise and make neat. If folks are scared of corona virus, would they not be put at ease knowing that the people who are working in the store they visiting are not infected?? 

What do I do? It is HR that has made these rules. I mean jesus, when I asked a manager "what happens if I get sick?" he's answer was "use your sick leave".
This is absolutely wrong, I want it to be out there and make sure that people in all retail stores are protected, who can I report such things to? It's not right to have a rocky 4 attitude of "if he dies he dies". It's very don't ask don't tell around these stores, and if you've ever been into an Ikea, you'll know that although they're big stores, they're very contained to certain areas.

In the current circumstances, I have no choice but to reduce my hours through no fault of my own but because my partner is not on the permitted workers list.

 Thoughts on centerlink obligations? Hey all! Wondering if I can get some feedback from people who seem to be mostly thinking rationally.

I (21F) am currently on Youth Allowance, and as such have to go to Job Agency appointments to continue getting paid. I moved about a month ago, have some pretty severe untreated anxiety (which I'm currently working on FINALLY getting in touch with someone who can help) on top of an autoimmune disease that centerlink refuses to acknowledge. 

At this point in time, I'm still **required by law** to make the commute into the city on a public bus, so I can sit in an office for not even 20 minutes to tell someone "yes, I've put in applications for jobs and am going to a doctor to look into treatment", then to come back home on a bus.  My appointment is next Thursday (March 27th). As it is, I haven't left the house since my last appointment which was at the end of last month, with legitimate fears for my health on top of some mad high anxiety. 

I don't want to reach out and ask if I can suspend my appointment  because well... centerlink. But I also don't want to leave it last minute to see if they cancel or otherwise postpone Centerlink obligations that require leaving the house. I just genuinely don't know wtf to do and am worried nothing will be done, I'll get cut off, and won't be able to pay rent through all of this. The last thing I want to deal with is putting myself *and* my housemates at even more risk because I couldn't pay my portion of rent because of a virus the government is still refusing to properly deal with.

 Follow up: My team and I made this simple chatbot that helps to cope with COVID-19 anxiety A while ago I posted about a [chatbot]( that helps with what's been on everyone's minds lately: COVID-19, specifically the coronavirus.

After lots of you mentioned some of the anxiety symptoms can be hard to differentiate from coronavirus related symptoms (chest pain, shortness of breath, and heart palpitations are just 3 examples), we realized it would be useful to write an [article]( to compare the symptoms as intense anxiety can, in some cases, cause similar symptoms to COVID-19, creating confusion, often leading to even more anxiety. So we made a list of the symptoms, as well as techniques to help you differentiate between anxiety and the coronavirus.

Curious what you guys think and if you find it helpful. If there are things you'd like to know that we do not cover, feel free to reach out to me.

 Medical professionals need to set an example and take the lead - wear masks and practice social distancing! Went to a GP this morning in Melbourne. Most staffs including doctors are not wearing masks. Those wearing them are not doing it properly. After that at Chemist Warehouse the same. Only 1-2 wearing masks. Nobody practices social distancing - customers or staffs. Coming from an Asian country where we managed to flatten the curve, this is incredible. Not sure if I should laugh or cry. Those that say masks don’t work, please take a look at China, HK, Singapore, South Korea and tell me what’s in common among them that managed the outbreak much better. Individuals each taking responsibility by wearing masks and keeping their distance. Medical professionals please start to set an example to others!!

This is something that has been bothering me throughout the pandemic response. There has been a notable lack of care when it comes to handling our private information when visiting places like cafes and restaurants. Many places keep the registry in the open where it can be photographed or stolen. Additionally, using paper introduces problems like legibility, liquid damage and no back-up copies. Further, paper can't destroy itself after 28 days.

Then we can look at the places that do have digital registers. Do they guarantee your data will only be used for the purposes of contact tracing? Can business owners access my private data without my permission? Will my data be given to any third parties? Will my data be destroyed after 28 days?

The problem has even been featured in [news articles](

I've had a crack at addressing this issue by creating my own QR-based contact registry: [www.covidvault.com.au](

As I made this from the perspective of a visitor, the design is to make the visitor experience as positive as possible:

* no app download required
* no accounts or sign-up required
* code is open-source
* visitor details are retrieved automatically for any business you visit using CovidVault
* visitor details cannot be used for marketing or any other unsolicited contact
* visitor details are removed from the database after 28 days

There are also some decent features for business that don't compromise visitor privacy:

* Free for most uses – no payment info required when signing up
* Can be setup and operational in under 5 minutes
* Provides captive marketing space on the post-check-in screen
* Business owners can stipulate conditions of entry that must be met by visitors
* Can be used to track business insights including visitors by day of week or by hour of day
* Option for “kiosk mode” via a tablet device at the entry for visitors without a smartphone

There's also a multiplier benefit for groups of businesses in a local area all using the same service (this could apply equally to any single contact registration system). Should there be a COVID case recorded at a CovidVault user's business, I can instantly determine if there are any other secondary contacts within the database.

If CovidVault interests you, please check out the project:

Any feedback is welcomed.

 Another Retail worker tests positive in Chadstone - Attended work yesterday 

I don’t understand why workers get tested then go back and attend work prior to receiving their result.

You literally get paid to stay at home and you can’t be fired if you refuse to go into work whilst pending a test.

 Just an FYI from the health professionals [Clinical Excellance Commision NSW Health](

The ANZIC guidelines have a lot of these recommendations.

The recommendations are:

Patient's with COVID be treated in a negative pressure room - the hospital I work in has 6!! The ICU in our hospital I'm not sure even has any. If there is no negative pressure rooms use single rooms. Our ICU has 2 single rooms!! Our ED has 0 single rooms in the resuscitation area.

If there is 1 case in an open area everyone in that area needs to wear a n95/p2 mask, gown, gloves, hair cover, eye protection (hopefully a face shield and not just goggles). If this is you or your family the likelihood of having visitors is so low as we have none of this equipment for them to wear. We barely have equipment for staff.

Guess what? It is recommended things like CPR and Intubation (breathing tube) are done in a negative pressure room or Single room. With staff wearing the correct protective equipment. That means if you or your loved one come into ED and are not breathing and we suspect COVID, CPR WILL NOT start unless it is safe for staff and other people in the hospital. We are not meant to bag (breath for) these patients. We are not meant to start chest compressions until the patient has a breathing tube in.

It is not recommended for us to use things like CPAP or BIPAP. High flow nasal oxygen can be used but recommended in negative pressure rooms or with the correct protective equipment.  

Please think about these things when you don't want to social distance.

 [SA] Flinders University: SA Health advises a person who today tested positive to COVID-19 recently attended the IELI Intensive English Language Institute on Sturt Campus Dear staff and students,

Flinders University has just been notified that a person who has today tested positive to COVID-19 has attended the IELI Intensive English Language Institute on Sturt Campus in recent days.

We are working closely with SA Health and IELI as further information emerges. At this stage no Flinders staff or student has been identified as a close contact and there are no confirmed cases amongst Flinders University staff or students.

**Notice of closure – Sturt Campus**

Out of an abundance of caution, effective immediately, all buildings on the Sturt Campus are closed while deep cleaning of the IELI rooms and shared/ common spaces of Sturt Campus is conducted. This closure includes IELI itself as well as Health2Go, FISC, Sturt Library and the Sturt Café. We are working with SA Health and IELI to ensure that all locations identified are deep cleaned.

We are closing Sturt Campus and asking staff and students to work and study from home until Monday 8am, unless otherwise notified.

There is no indication that the individual visited any other are of the campus outside of the Sturt Campus.

**Studying and working from home**

As per the email advice on Monday 16 November we are asking Flinders students to only attend one of our South Australian campuses if they have a scheduled class activity or exams. Flinders staff in South Australia who are able to undertake their work from home should do so.

**Symptoms and testing**

This is a timely reminder that anyone developing COVID-19 like symptoms – even if you have not been in one of the locations linked to the outbreak- should immediately get tested and self-isolate until you know the result of the test. If you have any of the following symptoms, get tested:

* fever or chills
* cough
* sore throat
* runny nose
* shortness of breath
* loss of taste and smell.

**Social Distancing**

Social distancing means increasing the space between you and others. It makes it harder for a virus to spread. The Department of Health has provided guidance on what [Social Distancing]( means in the home, at work and in public areas.

**Ongoing updates, information and support**

A further update will be provided tomorrow afternoon (Wednesday) or as further advice is received from SA Health. Flinders University continues to closely monitor the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak and we continue to align our actions with advice from the health authorities and the Australian Government.

If you have any questions or concerns please email them to [coronavirus@flinders.edu.au](mailto:coronavirus@flinders.edu.au).

Please check our [staff]( and [student]( websites for regular updates.

I realise that this current outbreak in South Australia may be a cause for concern or worry for members of our community. Please remember that our [student]( and [staff]( support networks are available to you throughout this period.

Take care and look after each other, and I will be in contact again soon.

Clare

 I’ve received two Job Seeker payments this month. On the 27th I will receive my first Job Keeper payment, which will included backdated pay to March 30th. Will I owe Centrelink all or just some of the Job Seeker payments I’ve received so far? 

My Job Seeker payment claim was submitted on the 24th of March and I received my first payment of $574.50 on the 7th of April and another yesterday, the 21st. 

The company I work for (which is currently closed) has had their Job Keeper application approved and I am due to receive my first payment on the 27th of April, which will be a lump sum including back payments from March 30th. 

I’m mainly wondering if I will owe Centrelink the full amount they have paid to me so far, or if I will just owe them a fraction of it. 

I was also wondering if I should report this to them through the “report my income” system on the app, or if this particular situation is too complex for the system and I’m better off talking to a human?

Also, will I need to have my Job Seeker payment cancelled immediately by formally cancelling it with them over the phone, or can I report my Job Keeper payments through the app and this will notify them of my income change so that the Job Seeker payment will terminate itself automatically?

Thanks! :)

 Are you an Officer worker stuck with a boss who still isn't taking it seriously? I'd like to hear others experiences. 

For offices the only regulation is people per square meter rule, everything else is 'suggested'. 

Even WFH is worded so employee has no rights.

What precautions has your workplace implemented?
++++++++++
 Boss is underpaying job-keeper and other concerns I am looking for some advice over how to manage a complaint I have over employee treatment at the pub which I work at. The boss has disregarded previous customer limits placed on us and would exceed people per square metre on most shifts that I worked. The rule breaking was exacerbated because whenever staff felt uncomfortable about breaking stage 2 rules the boss would dismiss our complaints and continue on as they had previously without regard to employee concerns nor the rules which were put in place. The mismanagement issues continued when the boss reduced wages for staff once job keeper was implemented and management additionally brought in staff who hadn't worked shifts for a period of months. Just to be clear, I don't have issue with my colleagues being supported with job keeper but I am concerned that the boss is pocketing some cheques which are meant for the workers. That being the case, I would appreciate some feedback about what I might be able to do to feel more confident in my work once stage two is reinstated:

Firstly, is there oversight for how Keeper payments were made and would there be a way to discern if the person was paid their entitlements once they were received by the boss and not pocketed by them? 

Once stage two is reinstated is there a way to gather evidence for breaking of the rules relating to people per square metre without implicating staff? This would need to be done in a way which does not implicate staff who may get fined if they are working during the rule breaks and aren't responsible as we have been overriding our concerns. Also, is there was a way to do this retroactively given ongoing issues with mismanagement and concerns going forward?

I'd appreciate any advice because this situation has put me and my colleagues in jeopardy during the pandemic. The issues are multiplied given how difficult it is to hold down a job and how much me and my colleagues rely on keeper to maintain our financial (and other) wellbeing. Obviously, I appreciate what work I have and don't want to put that at risk, but ideally I would not have to go back to breaking rules relating to covid once stage three ends.

 More than 100 nurses and paramedics are undergoing refresher courses to come back to work and help the Victorian health system cope with the coronavirus epidemic, state Health Minister Jenny Mikakos says.  

Fresh from an hour-long meeting the the Australian Medical Association and nurses’ and paramedics’ unions, Ms Mikakos said the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation had put the call out to nurses who had not recently worked in the profession to “come back on the tools”.

“That call-out has already resulted in more than a hundred nurses who will be picking up to do refresher training and get the practising certificates that they need so that they can assist us in that important task,” Ms Mikakos said.

“I’m also very grateful to the Victorian ambulance union, who has put a similar call out to retired paramedics, and they too have had a significant increase in retired paramedics who have contacted them, and they too will be prepared to go back onto the tools, to go back into the ambulance vehicles and assist Victorians in their time of need.

“I would encouraged any other healthcare worker who has retired, who hasn’t been practising for some time to assist us in these challenging times.

“They can contact their union as the first point of contact. They will then contact us and we’ll be sharing that information with health services, because we want to ensure, of course, that we have coverage across the entire state and particularly make sure that the needs of rural and regional Victoria are addressed as well.”

 AFR reveals draft restrictions for Victorian businesses. Construction sites, manufacturing plants, car dealerships and the majority of retail stores are set to be closed under the stage four restrictions poised to devastate the Victorian economy.

A draft document obtained by The Australian Financial Review sets out the huge numbers of businesses set to be shut from midnight Monday and the select few allowed to remain open as the Premier Daniel Andrews ramps up efforts to control the coronavirus outbreak.

Under the classifications in the document there are only three types of construction that will be allowed to continue: residential construction that is already underway, construction of critical infrastructure and infrastructure connected to essential services.

Workers at the Laverton North warehouse on Monday. Examples of construction sites that will be closed for business are residential building sites yet to open, non-residential building construction, heavy and civil engineering projects.

The new classifications also orders the majority of the state's retailers to bring the shutters down with car dealerships, furniture stores, retail hardware stores, electrical goods stores, department stores, florists, clothing stores, antique stores, food courts, auction houses and sex shops to close.

Retailers allowed to remain open include supermarkets, grocery shops, service stations, pharmacists, post offices, drive-through agricultural retailers and hardware stores that cater to permitted services or industries.

The document also puts a number of wholesale businesses into the column of businesses to be closed including motor vehicle sales, motor vehicle parts retailers, furniture, floor covering and other homeware wholesalers. Wholesalers that can remain open include grocery, liquor and tobacco businesses and wholesalers of cereal grains.

Under the new restrictions, businesses wanting to continue operating will need to seek a special exemption from Victoria's chief health officer.

Manufacturers of goods that "would, if not exempted, otherwise permanently close and create a major supply chain gap" or be "critical to global supply chains in the local and international manufacture of essential products overseas, such as medical equipment and supplies" will be exempted. So will businesses trading as sole operators.

Mining support services and exploration in Victoria will also be required to close with exemptions for coal, oil, gas, metal ore, petroleum, non-metallic mineral mining and quarrying.

For the financial services industry, only retail banking and the provision of banking services to those unable to access online services will be permitted. Financing, investing, insurance funds, superannuation funds and auxiliary finance and insurance services will be forced to close.

It is understood the finance industry was seeking greater clarity from the Victorian State Government on its interpretation of retail banking and the provision of retail banking services, after a similar ban in New Zealand saw some contractors such as security staff who oversee the maintenance of ATMs stopped at road blocks.

In the telecommunications and media sector book publishers, directory businesses, mailing list and software publishers are required to close while telecommunication services, newspaper production, radio and television braodcasting will be allowed to continue.

 Shopping for "Essentials" I work in retail, so apparently I am an essential worker. Not supermarket retail, but one other the department stores that isnt closed. There has been a lot of talk about only going out for essentials so why the hell are we still open when the only essentials we provide are things you can get elsewhere and are a low percentage of what we sell?

Yesterday I was working and it was exceptionally busy, like, xmas levels of busy. People out buying things that are not essential at all like toys and decorative homewares and a fucking gazebo while barely maintaining any social distancing and giving our store security guard shit when he asks them to distance.

Is there any way to stop these people coming in to basically use our store as a destination to cure their boredom? Myself and staff are livid that these dickheads are just browsing the store and putting staff at risk just so they can entertain themselves while having the ability and luxury to stay home. Can we call the cops and do they have powers now to tell people to get out if they are just buying things that aren't essential?

 Crazy sick worker. So the other day one of my workers  ( we are painters) just casually mentioned that his wife and kids were sick  the previous night.. and that they all got testes for Corona..

I ended up sending him home ( we are painting a very public place with 100s of customers coming in and out) 

One of my workers wife is friends with this person's wife so he made a couple of calls to find out more info.. turns out the wife and kids all had a fever.. and after a doctors visit the previous night she was told to isolate herself in a room away from the rest of the family.......

He really didn't want to leave work so I just told him not to worry he is still getting paid for a full day anyway and to go home... 

 Waiting on all the results now.

 Work has applied for JobKeeper but is cutting everyone's hours so we only get $1500. I work in healthcare. We're currently deemed essential services but we're not dealing with Covid-19 patients or anything life threatening. 

Currently working full-time (37.5hrs), pay is $2500 before tax. Today work informed every clinician that we're scaling down to 0.6 FTE. Which will be exactly $1500 for me. 

From my understanding they're meant to keep paying us our normal wage but then they receive the subsidy from the government. Can they do what they say they're doing? It feels to me like they're having the government completely pay my wage, but I'm still making money for the company. I had a look at the fact sheets and it didn't say anything about businesses being able to move staff to part time. 

Other businesses in my field have chosen to close clinics, paying clinicians the $1500 but those clinicians are not working. I will still be working reduced hours 5 days a week and putting myself and my family at risk of exposure for no extra benefit. 

The company I work for is a decently large international company. Employs about 3000 people across Australia.

 Need to go see psychologist who works in busy GP. I have a history of depression and suicidal thoughts. 


I haven't seen my therapist for awhile but in the last 3 days I found out my bf  had been cheating on me for awhile. It's taken a huge toll on me mentally cos i love the guy alot and saw a future with him.


Feel like I need to go see my therapist again.


Problem: my therapist works in a very busy GP. Busy enough that appointments are usually booked out the week before. 

They workl out of one of the spare doctor rooms so they share the same waiting room with no seperate entrance and this puts me off going there.


I called them up and told them I am paranoid about the Coronavirus but need to see a therapist. asked them how they practicing social distancing or how they are protecting their mental health patients from the sick patients. 


They replied with if you are paranoid you can wait on the front entrance instead of sitting inside the waiting room but we have no back entrance so we can't let you in a different entrance or waiting room.


Now I am left with the choice of which 1 is more important. protecting my mental health or protecting my physical health? 😭 😷

What would you do in my situation?
