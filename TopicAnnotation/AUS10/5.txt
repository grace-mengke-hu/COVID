 A message to anybody learning or teaching high school maths/physics With schools facing potential closures due to COVID-19, many students are having to face learning in a completely different environment to what they’re used to, and teachers are having to adapt their practice to accommodate this. In addition, while some schools are transitioning to online instruction, some others may not have the resources to provide it. I’m fortunate that the resources (powerpoint classes) I’ve made over my career lend themselves well to digital learning. I have classes made for Years 7-9 maths, Years 10-11 methods and Years 11-12 Physics. If you know anybody who could use resources to help them learn or teach more effectively in this time, share this link (I promise it’s not spam) with them.

 EBHS Principal Tim O'Brien - GET BACK TO SCHOOL GUYS ! EBHS Principal Tim O'Brien  - GET BACK TO SCHOOL GUYS !  

"Dear Parents/Caregivers,

Whilst we understand that many in our community hold significant concerns about COVID-19, it is important that in line with the advice from NSW Health and the Department of Education that except for those who are confirmed close contacts, **all other students should be at school."**

  

"Parents who are choosing to keep their child at home because they are concerned about the risk of COVID-19 need to be realistic about their expectations of teachers and, importantly, ensure they comply with the school expectations regarding absences, especially in terms of missed assessment tasks. **See attached for the Middle and Senior School Assessment Guidelines for your information.**

TRANSLATION  - if you don't go to school we will still fail you.  So you choose whether you want to pass or risk getting the virus !  You can't do both at EBHS !

While experts and government consider stricter social distancing and closures EBHS goes the other way.

 They just enforced "one person per 4 square metres." Our classrooms are generally 81 square metres in size (9x9m), up to 100 square metres (10x10m).

We have 27 students in our class, plus a teacher.

If each of those people needs 4 square metres of space;

81 / 4 = 20.25

100/ 4 = 25

Again, 27 students. There is NOT enough space. Yet, schools aren't cancelled. What the fuck?

 NSW Gov: New COVID-safe guidelines announced for NSW schools 10 November 2020

**Parents and carers will be permitted to attend end of year presentation days in NSW public schools under new COVID-safe guidelines.**

NSW Education Secretary, Mark Scott, today announced additional activities that can take place on school grounds in line with current NSW Health advice.

&gt;“Parents and carers will be able to attend end of year presentation days as we head towards a COVID-safe summer,” Mr Scott said.  
&gt;  
&gt;“P&amp;C meetings at schools can resume from November 12, and students can attend excursions to the ACT from today.”

Mr Scott congratulated schools and their communities for their on-going efforts, and reinforced that more now than ever students, staff, and people entering schools must remain vigilant and practise good hand hygiene.

&gt;“Carefully allowing additional activities to take place at schools will give our school communities a welcome return to some normality in what has been a long and challenging year for our students, educators, parents and carers,” Mr Scott said.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Schools across the state have shown outstanding resilience and flexibility in adapting to the many changes that have taken place this year and they should be applauded for the critical part they have played in the response to the pandemic.  
&gt;  
&gt;“While parents and carers will be able to attend important end of year events in person, including graduations, they will still need to continue to maintain 1.5 metres of physical distance from one another and follow all onsite health measures.  
&gt;  
&gt;“With visitors allowed into schools for some end of year events, it is vitally important that we remain focused and do not become complacent when NSW is doing so well. Schools must continue to follow NSW Health advice which includes maintaining regular hand washing and sanitising, staying home if you have COVID-19 symptoms and get tested immediately.  
&gt;  
&gt;“End of year events, school formals and graduations can be held from 12 November provided they follow department guidelines and NSW Health requirements for COVID-safe events.”

Mr Scott said the safety and wellbeing of students and staff remains the priority as we head towards the end of the school year.

“In the final weeks of the 2020 school year, it is extremely important that we continue the outstanding efforts of schools and the community to stay COVID safe so that we can all enjoy a well-deserved break and COVID-safe summer.”
