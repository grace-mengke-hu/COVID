 Businesses not following Covid-19 restrictions. My partner works in a hair salon and his boss says she is refusing to comply with the new restrictions about clients only being allowed 30 minutes or less in the hairdresser. Anyone know where I can report or who I can take this issue up with? Personally I think hair salons should be closed.

 Daniel Andrews will fine employers who force staff back to work in breach of work-from-home orders More national leadership from Andrews. Public transport trips are up \~20% this week. The power to fine employers who force workers back to workplaces just so they can keep an eye on them is good.  If you can work from home, your boss can't make you go to work yet. The gradual easing of restrictions is just common sense. 

Personally I have to go back to work next week, one hour on public transport each way, and the less people onboard who don't need to be there, the better.

 Jury trials suspended in Victoria to slow spread of coronavirus (doesn't include trials already underway)  

Victoria's court system has been thrown into disarray by the coronavirus shutdown, with all new jury trials suspended until further notice.

The Supreme Court and County Court will stop empanelling new juries from Monday as a precaution to slow the spread of COVID-19 in the community.

The decision will put huge strain on the justice system, with dozens of civil and criminal trials [affected by the decision]( over the next two weeks.

 "The courts acknowledge this is an unprecedented decision and we are confident it is in the best interests of the Victorian community," said Chief Justice Anne Ferguson.

 Final Nepal evacuation flight bringing Australian, New Zealand tourists to Brisbane A final planeload of Australian and New Zealand tourists who were stranded in Nepal by the novel coronavirus pandemic, has escaped from the country and will land in Brisbane.

The Nepal Airlines flight took off from the south-east Asian country on Wednesday, local time, and the Australian Embassy warned ANZACs “there will not be another flight to Australia”.

Stranded tourists were collected from their various hotels and brought to the local embassy before they were taken to the airport and boarded the Airbus A330.

"ANZACs all boarded. Ready to go. Safe travels home guys. Appreciate your patience and good humour. And thanks to everyone in Nepal and Australia who worked to get this done," Australian Ambassador to Nepal Peter Budd posted on Twitter.

The plane was carrying 250 returning tourists and was due to land at Brisbane Airport on Thursday, according to ABC News.

 South Australia to reopen NSW border if today's cases have known sources \[**10.56am\]**

South Australia will welcome travellers from NSW from Thursday provided no community transmission occurs today, Premier Steven Marshall has just announced.

Mr Marshall told reporters his government had decided to reopen borders despite a Sydney taxi driver testing positive on the weekend, prompting fears of a new outbreak.

He said SA Health had discussed the matter with NSW Health and received "all necessary information" regarding the new case.

"The advice is that this is the right decision," he said of the reopening.The NSW daily cases will be released about 11am today.

It comes after South Australia reopened its borders to ACT travellers last week.

 Qantas in talks with Woolworths to redeploy workers: Qantas is talking with Woolworths to see if its airline staff could be given work in their supermarkets, particularly baggage handlers which could aid the supermarket's ramped up restocking program.  

Qantas is talking with Woolworths to see if its airline staff could be given work in their supermarkets, particularly baggage handlers which could aid the supermarket's ramped up restocking program.

Two-thirds, or roughly 20,000, of the airline's staff have been temporarily stood down as it stops international flights from the end of the month and cuts domestic flights. Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said workers would likely have to take some leave without pay. 

Woolworths confirmed it is working with Qantas to find short term jobs for its stood-down workers, offering the affected employees a streamlined process to apply for the roles.

Woolworths’ chief people officer Caryn Katsikogianis said while the company was seeing unprecedented demand for food and groceries, it would need “more hands on deck” to help get food to customers over the coming months.

“We're creating a streamlined expression of interest process for Qantas and Jetstar employees taking leave without pay to see if we have suitable short-term opportunities across our store support office, supply chain facilities, customer fulfilment centres and stores,” she said.

“We’ll be looking to offer as many flexible contract and casual roles as we can to help us navigate the period ahead.”

**NSW Health:** [Twitter]( | [Media release - 15th August] | [Case statistics - up to 8pm 14 August 2020]( | [COVID-19 weekly surveillance in NSW]( | **NSW Government**: [Facts about COVID-19]( | [Data]( |
++++++++++
 Why are the government and medical advisers so cavalier about the virus infecting 25-75% of the population when they still don't understand the virology of the virus?  Queensland Chief Health Officer Jeannette Young confirmed that the state’s contingency planning assumed that at least 25 per cent of the population would be infected in the “first wave”. 

 [ 

 There is still so much we don’t know about this new virus. It is very new to its human host – we don’t know yet how it will behave. A cautionary approach is prudent until we know more.

 Victoria Police have done 1500 checks in the past 24 hours. 16 fines were issued during that time. 39 fines have been issued in Victoria in total. Premier Daniel Andrews has also announced a crisis council for the state. There is no new news on 'stage 4' restrictions, yet. *I've compiled below some of the coverage of Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews press conference this afternoon. I've pasted directly from source, then provided link.*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

* The Victorian Premier has announced a "crisis council of Cabinet" which will meet regularly aside from Cabinet meetings to discuss coronavirus response.   

* He also gave an update on how many people have found themselves in hot water for circumventing the lockdown laws. 
* *There are some who have done the wrong thing, and this small minority should be aware they will get caught.*   
*Victoria Police are out there doing their very best work. 1,500 checks have been done in the last 24 hours. There have been 39 fines, 16 of those from the last 24 hours.*   
*If you're mucking around, you will be caught because if you are caught, you're putting the safety, health, well being and the life of one of your fellow Victorians, their life at risk. If you do not, you may be caught and given a significant financial penalty.*
*   
Mr Andrews said there is no further news on "stage four" restrictions, but he still expects it will come to that at some stage.

**Vic ‘crisis council’ to coordinate response**

Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has announced the establishment of a “crisis council” of seven state ministers to coordinate the response to the coronavirus outbreak. The ministers were sworn in via video conference in what Mr Andrews said was a ‘world first.’

**Andrews: Plan for stage four restrictions**

Mr Andrews said he believed stage four restrictions would be introduced but did not detail what that would entail.

“I think there will be a stage four, when I’m in a position and when I need to make those announcements I will,” he said.

“I’ve tried to be very upfront about these different stages and the journey that we’re on,” he said.

“If I’m planning for it then VIctorians have a right to know and I am looking at a number of different steps and further measures that I believe will save lives.

“That’s the fundamental responsibility and obligation that I have. That’s not for today.”

 **Crisis cabinet will ’manage response then repair state’**

Daniel Andrews said his new crisis cabinet would assume the coordination functions across government departments in order to make quick decisions in response to COVID-19 pandemic as well as helping Victoria rebuild after the crisis.

“This council is all about managing the COVID-19 crisis and then making sure Victoria is in the strongest possible position once we get to the other side to repair the damage that’s done,” he said.

Mr Andrews said crisis cabinet included ministers James Merlino, Tim Pallas, Jacinta Allan, Jenny Mikakos, Jill Hennessy, Martin Pakula and Lisa Neville.

 Australia to help Pacific countries prepare for coronavirus outbreak   [ 

The Australian Government says it will help move more essential medical equipment to Pacific countries to aid them in preparation for COVID-19.

There are currently 153 confirmed cases in the Pacific, mostly in Guam, French Polynesia and New Caledonia.

But there are grave concerns about countries like Papua New Guinea's ability to handle even a mild outbreak.

With borders closed, it's facing logistical challenges that Minister for the Pacific and International Development Alex Hawke says Australia will help with, in collaboration with partners like the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat.

A formal announcement is expected within days.

"Australia facilitates a huge amount of movement of goods and people through the Pacific," Minister Hawke told the ABC's Pacific Beat.

"We're a transit country, we've got the capacity to move goods and people in many ways that other countries don't".

The Minister defended the speed of the government's assistance to regional neighbours during the global COVID-19 pandemic.

The Pacific is also expecting a cyclone that's formed between Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea, and will approach Vanuatu in coming days.

Papua New Guinea is to remain in a state of emergency for two months, with restrictions on movement within the country ease and international borders closed.

Both the Opposition Labor and the Greens Party have called for the Government to step up its response and commit more aid to the region, which already has under-resourced health systems.

"The Minister needs to ensure and provide evidence that there will be targeted extra support for our Pacific neighbours during this crisis and beyond," the Greens spokesperson for International Development Dr Mehreen Faruqi said.

"Our aid budget shouldn't fall victim COVID-19."

Minister Hawke said that Australia is already "repurposing any aid funding that is available for the Pacific into immediate relief in terms of health matters and COVID matters and I think you can see that trend continuing".

He also confirmed that there would be no further cuts to aid when the budget is handed down, which has been postponed from May to October after the Government announced stimulus measures worth more than $AUD200 billion to help Australians and the national economy.

 Does anyone feel surprised with how quick things have changed? I feel genuinely confused and surprised with how quick everything has transpired the last 4 weeks, with things looking really grim with predictions that were scary to now where we seem to be going really good with some states starting to ease restrictions ( open beaches, more people at gatherings etc ). The virus threat is still there and if we have a outbreak we will probably be hit even harder then the 1st initial wave but with things looking upwards lately it seems easier to listen to the good news rather then the bad. I thought the reopening of things would of taken much longer but who knows.

 Community sport to return for all ages in NSW from July 1 People of all ages will be allowed to take part when community sport recommences in NSW on July 1, Sports Minister Geoff Lee has just announced.

Mr Lee made the announcement in conversation with Ben Fordham on 2GB this morning.

Community sport was previously only set to return for children on this date.

"Everybody can play, it's game on for the whole community," Mr Lee said, adding that a taskforce was meeting this morning to finalise social distancing guidelines for players and spectators which would be available later this week.

"What we want to do is make sure people do it safely ... reduce social contact as much as possible."

Speaking on Today earlier this morning, Premier Gladys Berejiklian said her government was planning on announcing more eased restrictions today.

 Which Country is which? Let's lighten the mood with a competition.

Who can successfully guess who the three countries below are? I've removed names, exact population sizes and covid deaths from the table to give a bit of a challenge.
