 Final Nepal evacuation flight bringing Australian, New Zealand tourists to Brisbane A final planeload of Australian and New Zealand tourists who were stranded in Nepal by the novel coronavirus pandemic, has escaped from the country and will land in Brisbane.

The Nepal Airlines flight took off from the south-east Asian country on Wednesday, local time, and the Australian Embassy warned ANZACs “there will not be another flight to Australia”.

Stranded tourists were collected from their various hotels and brought to the local embassy before they were taken to the airport and boarded the Airbus A330.

"ANZACs all boarded. Ready to go. Safe travels home guys. Appreciate your patience and good humour. And thanks to everyone in Nepal and Australia who worked to get this done," Australian Ambassador to Nepal Peter Budd posted on Twitter.

The plane was carrying 250 returning tourists and was due to land at Brisbane Airport on Thursday, according to ABC News.
