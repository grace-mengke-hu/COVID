 Where do you rate the risk of community infection currently in Australia? The official government line is that risk of community spread is low to very low.  I think most people on this subreddit think the Government is down playing the risk, so I wanted to gauge where we think it really is.

Personally I think we some changes in the way we go about our daily lives, most people can reduce their own personal risk to "Low". I put myself in this category.

So where are you? Very Low, Low, Medium, High or Very High.  If High to Very High, why do you think that is the case.

 MINIMUM PRACTICAL PROTECTION for Businesses and Public Workers and PUBLIC If you interact commonly with the public, PLEASE PLEASE WEAR AN EFFECTIVE MASK. The only ones proven to work are rubber sealed FULL FACE MASKS, which protect your eyes as well as your breathing orifices. Goggles are impractical as they are extremely uncomfortable to seal with, and also non-swimming ones have holes that allow for ventilation.  


The ONLY filters that properly work are rated P2 or above, cartridge based, as you do not want to take chances with evaporated viruses floating in the air. They stay there for 3 hours at a time according to a study (google it).

You can buy the 3m 6800 here with P1 or something filters

AVOID BUYING HALF CUPS. THEY ARE NOT EFFECTIVE. SURGICALS ARE PLACEBO. THERE IS NO SEAL AROUND THE NASAL RIDGE AND ON THE SIDE OF SURGICALS. 

PROTECT YOURSELF to PROTECT OTHERS. 

Remember how many people are asymptomatic, and the sky high longest incubation of 24 days.

Good luck mates.
