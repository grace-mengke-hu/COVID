 What’s happening with VET/TAFE courses my school age child is completing for Yr12? My son is in Yr12 and has been completing 2  VET/TAFE courses via TAFE during his school terms. I haven’t heard anything from his school nor TAFE (except for him not actually going to TAFE due to COVID19 isolation contingencies)

Has any other parent with a child in similar situation heard anything about what they plan to do about these courses? As far as I can tell there is no online classroom model and how can he complete practical sessions if he can’t attend classes?

Any info would be most helpful thanks

 The likelihood of infection, severity and death explained in a way even the “just the flu crew” will understand We who reddit all know the stats and figures but I read this earlier and it shook me.

For every 100 people you know:

50 of these people will get sick 
10 will be severe cases
1 or 2 will die

However if all 50 of the sick and the 10 severe happen at the same time and we don’t have sufficient resources in hospitals then instead of 1-2 dying, 3-4 will die.

 Can Nursing Homes Forbid Visitors Even When Government Directives Don't Apply? My mother's NSW nursing home rang to say I cannot make my regular visits for the next two weeks citing a government directive. They sent me that PDF which only applies to people from certain Local Government Areas (currently: Liverpool, Campbelltown, Camden, Wingecarribee and Wollondilly, and of course parts of Victoria). This home is in none of those LGA's and I neither live in nor pass through any of those. Do you they reserve the right to block me regardless?

 NSW will require Victorians to enter hotel quarantine NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has announced that Victorians travelling into her state will be required to spend 14 days in mandatory hotel quarantine.

People who have been in Victoria will also only be allowed to travel into a border community or into Sydney Airport.

These people will be required to pay for their hotel quarantine, as is expected of international arrivals.

"We also feel, given the evolving situation in Victoria has been going on for some weeks, that people [should quarantine] at their own expense," Ms Berejiklian said on Wednesday afternoon.

The new measures will come into effect on Friday. Border permits will also be further restricted.

"We are reviewing and look to tightening some of those definitions to make sure only those with absolutely necessary requirements [are allowed to enter]," Ms Berejiklian said, adding that "of course, the death of an immediate family member would be an example of a situation where we would allow obviously people to continue coming in to NSW".

 Level 2 Quarantine Hotel - Thoughts/Opinions I’ve been think a lot lately about international travel and how that could open up right now for some countries if the right procedures are in place.

Countries such as NZ, Singapore, Japan, Taiwan etc have low levels of transmission, but anyone arriving from those countries are still required to undergo mandatory quarantine in facilities designed for people arriving from hotspots such as the UK &amp; US.

I understand that state governments are reluctant to increase capacity of these facilities due to the high risk of the virus escaping and the amount of resources required from police and health personnel. But what about if we had a second tier hotel quarantine arrangement for people arriving from low risk countries?

These level 2 quarantine facilities could be staffed 100% by security guards, people would need to have PCR before getting on the plane to Oz and one when they’ve finished their quarantine and the quarantine time could be reduced to a week. 

Something like this could operate on a much larger scale than the current system, the risks would be minimal due to the countries allowed to enter under such a system and it would start some sort of international travel normalcy.

Any thoughts/opinions on something like this for low risk countries?

 An analogy that I've been working on re: tinfoilers vs the disaffected I was called out recently for calling people who are protesting the lockdown measures "tinfoilers". It wasn't exactly what I meant but that's how it was interpreted so I've been looking for a good way to describe it. This is what I've come up with.

&amp;#x200B;

Think of most of us as barrels, and our frustrations as gunpowder. Normal use of gunpowder is to take a portion of it, load it into the cannon, arm it (in this analogy with facts) aim it at an issue and fire for effect. This achieves some catharsis, some of those feeling are gone and we go on about our lives, hopefully the issue has been resolved.

At the moment however, our barrels are full. They're leaking gunpowder everywhere and we're not being given the opportunity to load those cannons and address the issues. 

Now, along come the actual tinfoilers. The kids who were never told "no" growing up, grew into adults with no boundaries. They love to sit at their keyboards and flick metaphorical matches out randomly just to see what happens. Maybe their match is homeopathy. Maybe it's 5G causes COVID. Maybe it's chiropracty, cupping or TCM. 

Pre-COVID, their match might have landed in a barrel, but with little powder in it, the damage is limited. They convince a parent to use pseudo-medicine and a child dies. The support gay conversion and screw up one or two lives. They convince a cancer patient that crystals will save them, and shave off a few months of their life, or potentially prevent remission. 

Now, however, they want us to congregate. To pack together, with our full barrels and lids off, so that they can flick their matches and wait for the bang. And maybe some of us have damp powder, so we don't go bang ourselves. We take it home and the smouldering core sets off a family member instead. Or several of them.

&amp;#x200B;

How do we stop this? Say no to these people. Be the parent they needed. Set healthy boundaries and enforce them and if necessary, cut them off.  Use some of your powder to take aim at the right targets: hysteria mongers, pseudoscience  quacks, narcissists and their ilk.

 Coronavirus: How Australia is preparing for a possible domestic outbreak

 Typically, how close do you need to be to a cough or sneeze to get infected by viruses? Hello everyone,

I am a uni student in Sydney so travelling there 3-4 days a week has got me worried, especially having to spend around 3 hours on the train each day. Obviously viruses transmit through coughs and sneezes from the infected but how far do these need to be? For example if someone sneezes at one end of the carriage can the droplets travel across the entire train carriage? What would be the range where coughs and sneezes can infect others? I am asking this because every time I get on the train there is AT LEAST one person who sneezes or coughs (maybe my minds just focusing on the coughs and sneezes)....

These events are exactly what you do not do at this point in time from the point of view of virus pandemic control.

I think Melbourne’s been betrayed by the government for money despite all the evidence seen around the world.

 Statement From The Victorian Premier - 25 March 2020 Last night, National Cabinet took another big step. I want to tell you why and let you know what we need you to do right now.

The Prime Minister and other first ministers recognised that Victoria is currently grappling with a more imminent threat than most other states – because we have more cases.

Because of this, we agreed states and territories will soon need to take individual measures – because this is moving at a different speed in different places.

I am pleased that National Cabinet has made that decision – and tonight we’ll discuss it further.

We said there would be a Stage 2 and that’s what we’re doing today. But I’ll be up front with you, there will also be a Stage 3.

We need more time to get our health system ready for what’s coming. Every country in the world that is running ahead of us would give anything to have had more time.

Last night, the Prime Minister went through the details of Stage 2 restrictions on non-essential venues and activities. In Victoria, those will begin at midnight tonight.

We don’t take these actions lightly but to put it bluntly: if we don’t slow this thing down, we won’t just have people waiting in line for Centrelink – we’ll have people waiting in line for machines to help them breathe.

I know this is stressful and I know this is scary.

The measures we already have in place are difficult, and these will be harder again.

I want to reassure you that things like supermarkets, petrol stations, banks, post offices and bottle shops – and a number of other essential services – will be staying open.

But I want to be very clear: the more people ignore the rules and ignore the advice – the more this virus will continue to spread.

There is no social occasion or celebration that’s worth more than a human life.

For Victorians that means if you can stay home, you must stay home.

We are all being asked to make sacrifices. Because if we don’t, people will die.

A full list of Stage 1 and 2 restrictions will be available at coronavirus.vic.gov.au. Businesses seeking advice about whether they are affected can also call the Business Victoria coronavirus hotline on 13 22 15.

 Since March 2, daily Victorian cases have only been below 5 daily cases 11 times. And never reach a 14 day average of below 5. Is this threshold too tough to meet to ease restrictions? Don't get me wrong. I am pro-mask, pro-social distancing, pro-vax. Science is science. But on that note of science being science, and considering Victoria has never achieved daily case numbers below 5 cases, I am wondering whether people think this is an achievable goal?

I'm of the opinion, we still need to be vigilant, focus on postcodes with high daily caseloads to restrict movement and focus on measures to laser focus tracing and containment in new outbreak areas.

Thoughts?

 [Travel Exemption] Can someone help me with this 'ordinarily resident' question? So, we all know you don't need exemption if you are ordinarily resident in a country other than Australia, whereby you are considered ordinarily resident in a country other than Australia if you’ve spent more time outside Australia than inside for the last 12 to 24 months. The 12-24 months is what confuses me.

I am an Australian citizen, living in Victoria. I have a British passport but haven't been to England in years, nor have I ever lived there. But, last year between February and December I was overseas in Asia. In the last 24 months, I've spent more time inside Australia than out. But if I pick, say, the last 18 months, I've spent more time overseas.

Can someone clarify if I go to the airport, tell border force look at my movements the last 18 months, and thus let me through? Bit confused.

 The "lack of testing" argument doesn't stack up. For weeks now I have seen people pushing the theory that there is some large group of hidden cases that haven't been picked up, but I believe that doesnt stack up and here's why. Lets assume for the moment that theres some H factor for coronavirus,  H being the average % of cases over the whole population that requires hospitalization or treatment. If you look at the current graph of infections and you imagine another imaginary line on that graph that represents thr "true" number of cases, ie the real number of cases both detected and hidden it's mathematically impossible for the number of hidden cases to rising indefinitely while the detected cases are slowing because of H. There will always be a baseline of cases that get picked up because the H bad cases will present at clinics and hospitals. The detected line and hidden line cannot be diverging constantly at some point the detected cases must converge at least in part to the true cases at some point which we haven't seen.

 Boss wants to start transitioning us back to the office. I’m in a high risk category and I’m worried. Any advice? Hello! I hope you’re all doing well and staying safe.

Sorry if the title is a bit vague. To make it more clear I live in NSW and have been working from home since early March on my doctors advice. I am on two immunosuppressive medications and those plus my condition still being active put me in a high risk group.

My boss doesn’t like that everyone is currently working from home. To put this in perspective, she waited till the last minute to let everyone WFH, despite a large chuck of our 100+ person team complaining and me and a few other people who are high risk or live with someone who is getting notes from our GPS.

Now that things look calmer (but far from over of course) she has decided to start the transition back to the office. I am completely terrified of this for obvious reasons, but I don’t know how to go about telling her I’m not budging till I get all clear from my doctor, even if that’s a year from now.

I am already planning to get another doctors note but I know she’ll resist it. Any more advice? I don’t want to get sick and be a burden on our healthcare or worse make someone else sick. Thank you all!

 perverse incentives From [David Limbrick](

&gt; The new authorised officer powers in the Omnibus bill could undermine contact tracing systems and increase “mystery” cases through perverse incentives.   Here’s why:   
&gt;  
&gt; The authorised officer powers will allow positive cases or their close contacts to be arrested if it is “reasonably believed” they will not obey a direction. No actual breach is necessary. This is effectively allowing arrest for “pre-crime”.  Therefore -   
&gt;  
&gt; Any name given to a contact tracer will become at risk of arrest for pre-crime. Considering these people will be friends, family and co-workers, it seems likely many would catch the amnesia that seems to be going around. “I don’t recall who I was with”.    
&gt;  
&gt; Some may even consider providing names to contact tracers as unethical once this law is passed, considering the risk those people could be at.    
&gt;  
&gt; An alert on your COVIDsafe app means you could be at risk of arrest for pre-crime. This seems unlikely to improve the already dubious usefulness of this app.  

"I don't recall."

 University of Newcastle to stay open - exams dates pushed back, Lectures moved to “bigger rooms” From Facebook:

“The health and wellbeing of our students, staff and visitors is our top priority, so we’re implementing a number of measures to ensure we support our community at this time, including:

👉 Exam changes as we move to Extended Terms
👉 Applying social distancing to all classes 
👉 Postponing graduation ceremonies
👉 Cancelling large and non-essential events
👉 Planning for periods of working from home

As we’ve done throughout this situation, we will continue to rely on NSW Health advice before making any decision to close our sites. It is important to remember that there have been ZERO confirmed cases of COVID-19 at any of our campuses. We are, of course, looking at scenario planning to implement progressive social distancing strategies to be able to respond quickly to changes.”

“Hi Torran, From 23 March we will apply social distancing to all classes. What this means is lectures for large groups (e.g 200+ people) will be recorded or a Zoom video facility will be available. Large lectures (eg. 100+) will be rescheduled to larger spaces to allow people to sit 1.5m apart.  
Additionally, from 23 March all face-to-face lectures will be a maximum length of 1hr 40mins in light of government health advice to keep meetings to under two hours in duration.”

 The importance of early and drastic measures A modelling tool for COVID-19 spread has been developed by University of Basel in Switzerland. You can access it here:  

The credentials of the team who developed the tool look very solid. Read about them on the "About" page of the link.

Putting in the relevant Australian numbers (population (25 million) current infections (700), number of hospital beds (92000) ICUs (2013) etc), we get the following results:

If "no mitigation" measures are taken, we end up with 238,000 deaths

If "weak mitigation" measures are taken, we end up with 210,000 deaths

If "moderate mitigation" measures are taken - 137,000 dead. The key difference here is that the hospital system is not completely overwhelmed, and most people get treatment. But there is a significant fatality rate even with treatment. This is what "flattening the curve" looks like.

If "strong measures" are taken, the loss of life falls to.... 2285 people. The disease does not reach a large percentage of population. This is what China managed to do. 

Note however that for every 4 day delay in implementing "strong measures" the death toll will double.

The model does not explicitly state what "weak", "moderate" and "strong" mitigation measures actually are. But the current spread data in Australia is consistent with "weak" measures.

The current government response seems to be focused on trying to manage the economic effects of COVID-19 epidemic. Unless we are willing to accept 200,000+ deaths, this will have to change. Every 4 day delay will result in doubling of deaths. 

We need drastic measures, and we need them early. 

The best way to limit the economic impact of this epidemic is to first and foremost address the spread of infections directly.

 NSW Gov: NSW hits three million tests as community urged to remain vigilant 27 October 2020

As the state marks three million COVID-19 tests since January, the NSW Government is calling on the community to continue to work together to fight the deadly virus.

Premier Gladys Berejiklian said reaching three million tests was a major milestone in the state’s fight against [COVID-19](

“I want to thank everyone in NSW who has come forward to be tested – three million COVID-19 tests is an incredible result,” Ms Berejiklian said. 

“As we ease restrictions, it is critical that we maintain our high rates of testing which has been central to our success in limiting the spread of the virus and keeping NSW open.”

Health Minister Brad Hazzard warned that while recent easing of restrictions is very welcome, it comes with risks and it is critical everyone keeps getting tested.

“This is a stealthy virus and if we give it an inch, it will take a mile and undo a lot of good work,” Mr Hazzard said.

“The community response to COVID-19 has been fantastic and I thank the people of NSW for their efforts and sacrifices during the past nine months, which have put us in a position where we have been able to ease restrictions.

“We hope to be able to continue to ease restrictions in the weeks and months ahead, but this depends on us being successful in minimising community transmission.”

As at 8pm on 26 October 2020, 3,000,641 COVID-19 tests had been performed on 2,247,101 people in NSW. Of those people tested, 63.7 per cent had a single test and 36.3 per cent had more than one test, with 1.16 per cent having more than five tests.

NSW Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant said it was critical that people continue to come forward for testing and practice COVID-safe behaviours when out and about and catching up with family and friends.

“When we have high numbers of people continuing to get tested, that allows us to detect cases in the community earlier and prevent onward transmission,” Dr Chant said.

“Get tested at the first sign of even the [mildest of symptoms]( wash your hands regularly, physically distance and wear a mask when using public transport and in places where you can’t physically distance.

“We have been able to get the recent clusters under control with the support of the community, but their emergence shows that the risk of a resurgence of cases in NSW remains very real.”

Restrictions eased recently by the NSW Government include:

* 30 people can now gather outdoors in public spaces (previously the rule was 20 people). It remains a maximum of 20 people in households
* there can be 30 customers per booking, and 30 customers per table, at hospitality venues (previously the rule was a maximum of 10 customers)
* corporate functions of up to 300 people can now be held at any appropriate premises, including at restaurants, subject to a COVID safety plan (previously it was just function centres)
* religious gatherings/places of worship (excluding weddings and funerals) can have up to 300 people, subject to a COVID-19 safety plan
* gyms are now only required to have a [COVID-19 safety marshal]( if there are more than 20 people in the gym at one time.

Additionally, from 1 December 2020, the number of people who can attend weddings will be increased to 300 people subject to the four square metre rule indoors and two square metre rule outdoors. This will allow people to make plans and book venues knowing the capacity ahead of time.

There are more than [300 COVID-19 testing locations]( across NSW. Find your nearest [clinic]( or contact your GP. Most people receive their results within 24 hours.

 Has Australia's media played a helpful or counterproductive role in this pandemic? This question is inspired by this tweet by [The Sensible Centre](

![img](do1u72couqq41 "

Some people are replying to that tweet saying that [the media is exaggerating the panic because fear sells papers](

In contrast, my brother has constantly been complaining about Australian media downplaying the Coronavirus threat. He was complaining that the media was trying harder to prevent panic than to prevent the spread of COVID-19. He was complaining that the media didn't pressure the government enough into enacting the successful measures in Singapore. Now that the pandemic has become this bad, he is vindicated, and he believes that the media should apologise for downplaying the threat and allowing the pandemic to spread.

Even though I am a microbiologist myself, I, and my colleagues saw no reason to panic back in February. Now I am eating my words. Should the media be eat its words for downplaying or exaggerating the threat of COVID-19?

The testing snafoo is mentioned way too much with people not realising that we have limited testing kits unlike S.Korea in which have four companies in the country able to manufacture kits. We also don't have the economy for it and I don't thing people realise we have just came put of the biggest natural disaster in our counties history. I think people need to concentrate on their own shit social distancing, hygiene because that at the end of the day is what matters. Again look at S.Korea who are constantly looked at as the example of how to handle a pandemic didn't lockdown.

If something needs to used before the end of the year push those items to the front for higher priority.  If they have a date in 2022 or beyond push or store them towards the back.  Avoid spoilage and waste.

 States and local councils will have power to close down venues that do not comply with social distancing rules  

"If there have been pubs and clubs that are heaving with people on the weekend, that is simply an invitation for the states and Territories to shut them down," said Mr Morrison.

"If they are unable to get a handle on that, than they are bringing on what would be their worst outcome, and there is a responsibility, both on those who run those venues and those who are going to these venues.

"I mean, coronavirus is not a secret. Everybody knows. It is wall-to-wall on every coverage, and every conversation happening   
around this country today. And so there is no excuse to say you don't know. It is one to 1.5 metres. It is a four square metre rule. You have to keep a healthy distance between each other.

"If Australians can't do that on a broad scale, then they are denying the governments and the authorities the most important weapon we have to save lives and to save livelihoods, and states and territories will have to take more severe responses to deal with that.

"So, we are simply appealing to people to show common sense, to respect each other, and do the right thing when it comes to following these very simple rules.

"But inevitably, and I suspect soon, there will be need for in particular locations more extreme measures to be taken. And that is exactly why I took the decision to bring forward the next meeting of the National Cabinet from Tuesday evening to this evening, where those specific issues will be managed."

 The Wuhan Military Games theory - lets get our tin foil hats on Or maybe not.

What if it wasn't any walking bio weapon from USA, or being deliberately or accidentally leaked by the Wuhan viral studies lab.

What if Coronavirus was contracted by one of the competitors from the smaller countries that have diets that go beyond the standard livestock? Maybe its not even intentional, maybe that person just wanted some food and unfortunately got hit with Coronavirus and was asymptomatic, and passed this to someone else who was also asymptomatic (either one of the officials or staff at the Wuhan stadium, or maybe the infected person wandered around to visit China and passed it on to someone else?)

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways all I am saying is that, maybe we should stop blaming the "usual suspects" and just consider the possibility that it was something that's just slipped under our radar with no ill intent.

 People outside Australia are outraged over not being able to travel to AUS as well as have to pay for quarantine! What have we come to 🤦🏼‍♀️ Hi guys,

So I have been very active in a lot of Facebook groups for people that want to migrate to Australia or just come here for a holiday. 

There is a lot of discussion on how unfair those rules are and that people should have the freedom to travel freely despite being in this shitshow of situation. 

In my opinion and being an expat myself, the rules are fair and I don't see why I have to spend XXk income tax on people that are trying to galavent the world and putting us further in danger. Unless you got a good reason to travel, stay where you are until the situation is somewhat under control or we have figured out a way of safe travel! 

This inspired me to make a little video about it, to ensure that my German fellas are aware of the actual situation:

I thought you could only have 10 people per booking, but she had a photo of the whole group and I counted 30 people??

Looking at the stories of people I know, it seems everyone is still happily dining out, seeing friends, going to the pub and even going away on the weekend to regional NSW. Don’t they know the virus is still circulating in Sydney and we could become like Melb very soon?

 500,000 more test kits on the way  

The editor-in-chief of the Medical Journal of Australia has heralded the scheduled arrival of 500,000 COVID-19 test kits later this week that deliver a result in 15 minutes.

Nick Talley, laureate professor at the School of Medicine and Public Health at the University of Newcastle, said priority had to be given to planes delivering the kits to Australia to allow them to land in the country. of the kits to Australia had to be made a priority.

“Good news! New quick test for COVID-19 approved,” Professor Talley tweeted.

“15-minute test. 500,000 kits are due to land in Australia this week if all goes well with airfreight space, planes are able to land and they pass border control. A priority!”

 My current school experience/situation as a teacher  I work in a small school in Western Australia.

At least seven staff members are currently sick with symptoms of covid19. Three staff members have been away from school for a week only to return today still ill.

Now I am showing symptoms.

Has anyone been tested after requesting? No.

The state and federal governments, along with their respective education departments are grossly negligent.

This "bury your head in the sand approach, and pretending no one has it because you deny them testing" approach needs to stop now

People will die because of this. All because of economic fear.

 Questions we want journalists to ask our politicians Some journalists obviously lurk here, so I thought it would be good to make a list of questions we would like to be asked at press conferences.

\- How many test kits do we have in Australia? How many have we ordered?

\- Why aren't we testing for community spread? If testing kit shortages are an issue, why aren't we testing a small amount randomly per day in different regions?

\- How many tests are new suspected cases, and how many are tests of infected people, who need two negative tests 24 hours apart before they are deemed to be recovered? If many tests each day are currently infected people, we're not testing as many potential new cases as our governments are positioning it as. Can we please receive this information in state-based daily figures.

\- Why are you not releasing the modelling, on which you have based the spending of hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars? When will Australia's experts and public be able to see the government's impact models, like every other developed nation has done?

\- With children dying of COVID-19 overseas, what is the evidence that schools are still safe to keep open?

&amp;#x200B;

Add your own questions. 

If the thread gets traction, maybe we could sticky it so journalists see it at the top of the subreddit, and we could add to it on an ongoing basis. It will also give us a centralised source of questions to tweet to journalists and politicians.

 Australian Citizen Overseas &amp; Wanting to Return Home. Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

Need a few questions answered here..

I've been living in Canada, Ontario for nearly the past 2 years.. My Work Visa ends in March. I'm wanting to fly home to Queensland soon and do NOT want to quarantine for 14 days in a shoebox. Wondering if it's possible to apply for an exemption to quarantine at home with my father. OR at the least be able to have an exemption on the cost of quarantine.. Any news of a possible rapid test happening too??

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you very much.

 Process of leaving Australia at airport Recently I received the outcome of my request to travel application



Is there anything I should bring to the airport? Cuz I had a look at a few posts before and someone said bringing the copy of the request to travel application/exemption(Which is all online and there is nothing that could be printed out), along with copy of birth certificate,lease,personal ID... etc.

  
I'm really worried that I will get rejected once again at the airport due to the covid lockdown, anyone can describe the process of leaving Australia under lockdown with exemption?

 Creative tips for helping the elderly, who are alone, cope with loneliness when they don't have technology? I would love to hear some creative tips on how we can support the elderly to cope with their loneliness during isolation. Phone calls are obvious but what if that isn't enough and they are struggling? Many are living alone and do not have computers or smart phones therefore video conferencing is not an option, nor is any face to face contact for many. These tips could also apply to other vulnerable groups who are alone.

 US military has guidelines for setting up alternative care sites. This information has been published specifically with regard to the current corona virus outbreak.

The main principal being either the modification of existing Hotels or open stadiums to provide hospice care for the infected.

Clealry doing so would require people with technical expertise, plumbers, electricians, carpenters, and other technical expertise.

Therefore the time to start considering such options is before the tipping point hits and we have no beds in ICU.

 A mate of mine was at a pub in Sydney on Saturday night... I spoke to him when he got home and he said the pub was fairly busy with quite a few people there and the regulars. He said the general consensus was that “it’s all overblown, overhyped” and that most people that were there aren’t really taking this seriously. He also said to me that he doesn’t think it’s a big problem. 

I have been following this since late January... I had a feeling things were going to heat up and they have. But it’s worse than I ever thought it would be!

I said to him - hey they are shutting countries down at the moment. Entire cities. I don’t think they would be doing this if there wasn’t a serious, serious, fucking serious threat.

He said he hopes it’s not but we will see.

Most people I speak to think this whole thing isn’t a big issue. I honestly fear for this country as I believe everyone is in for a huge shock in an a couple of weeks, or even sooner when things start getting out of control here. I don’t think a lot of people understand what is happening.

The government isn’t doing enough. People are out and about doing their normal weekend shit and the world is falling apart around us. 

I want to be wrong about this and I hope Australia can get on top of it. But from what I am seeing in the public and from what others are posting on here - the majority of people in the general population are not paying attention, are ignoring it or are just fucking stupid.

There are a lot people in for a huge shock. 

To add to this I’m on blood pressure medication, I’m an asthmatic and high risk. 

Be safe everyone and keep doing what you are doing.

 How many of you are working from home? The organisation I work for (government) have said they’re “looking into” flexible work options for high risk people. It seems like we should all be working from home by now, not ‘considering’ it at some point in the future for certain people. 

Being government, it’s extremely hierarchical, so my direct manager won’t contravene this. Just wondering if this is roughly normal or if most office job professions are now working from home?

 PM Scott Morrison, children and herd immunity For those asking, the actual words spoken by Morrison today relating to herd immunity. 

  

…the issue of wide-scale closure of schools, it may be anti-intuitive but the advice is this could actually be a very negative thing in terms of impacting on how these curves operate. It happens for two reasons, when you take children out of schools and put them back in the broader community the ability for them to potentially engage with others increases that risk and that’s the understand we have. **There’s also issues of herd immunity that relate to children as well and Dr xx (the Chief Medical Officer) may want to touch on those issues…**

 The government is failing Victorians. Should the Victorians take matters into their own hands and fight this virus the right way, regardless of economic consequences? Please read, share your thoughts. The government is gradually letting the virus loose in the community, whether on purpose or not.

They are putting in less than ideal restrictions at far too late of a timing.

The governments plan is "suppression" - as to not eliminate the virus completely because of the poor economic outcomes. Essentially trading lives for money.

Maybe it is time for an organised and professional revolt. Take control of the situation and close our businesses, and keep people at home for a period of time. Encouraging a stage 4 type restriction state wide, at our own will.

We could create a catchy slogan, a website and viral posts, groups on social media, put flyers up in all towns, appoint a leader for every shire council and hold regular zoom meetings, etc. All with the goal of doing the right thing and saving lives while eliminating the virus.

I'm sure people would be very interested. We would need creative graphic designers to create informative, catchy slogans and media to post everywhere. Maybe a skilled social media campaign organisers to make sure the message gets across. 

If enough people get on board, we could enforce our own "lockdown" and do it the right way. There would be economic consequences but, really, aren't people worth keeping alive?

I'm picturing a huge movement with a catchy slogan and strong branding, led by everyday people, for the best interest of the everyday people. Something that will be recorded in the history books as an example of an effective civillian led peaceful movement.

Thoughts?

 Dual citizenship travel exemption #Australia #covid19 Im trying to book a flight back to Europe, however I’m not sure if I need to apply for the exemption to travel or not with a dual citizenship. 
I came into Australia on the Aus passport, however I’m wondering if I can just leave with the other passport, although it was never recorded entering Australia?
They are very vague over the phone and I read an article of them rejecting claims, explaining simply that they need not apply. 
Over the phone I spoke to 2 different people on seperate occasions, one saying I don’t need to apply and one saying the opposite. 
Anyone had experience?

 What if someone in VIC got a stage 4 fine then went back to their home state? When I was homeless and sleeping on trains in NSW I got a few no-ticket fines but heard no more about them after going to another state.  Though this is obviously more serious, but you hear about people escaping the law by going to another state all the time.

I don't mean not wearing a mask but e.g staying at an airbnb or hotel, and traveling outside the 5km from that location.  If you don't have proof of address in vic, how on earth can the police determine your temporary address unless you're a poor liar?

Note I don't want to do any of this but I'd definitely take advantage of the vic goverment pleading for tourists once stage 4 is lifted.

 What's the likelihood that a child has contracted the coronavirus from an exposed parent or a delivered item ? Sorry for the odd title. I'm seeking information on the possibility of a 7yo child contracting the coronavirus indirectly from an exposed person or item delivered to the house ? 

**We are awaiting blood and x-ray test results hopefully tomorrow im just seeking others opinions on the situation not a diagnosis.**

Long story short. I have a son who is immune compromised as he has a very mild form of cystic fibrosis (CF) and has been asymptomatic for the majority of his life. No enzymes or medication required. He is very well but i will refer to him as CF son as we have 2 some.  Our CF son, myself and younger son (4) have been primarily in isolation since 21 March.  

Husband travelled domestically on the 17 March. He brought home what we believe was a cold. He passed it onto our 2 sons.  One is really sick. The other is mostly recovered. CF son has had a "cold" for a few weeks and has been on oral steroids, antibiotics and ventolin for a week. We all had Flu shot 3 April and CF/ other son were well otherwise I wouldn't have had it done. 

Husband found out a week later that he was on a flight with a positive corona virus patient but was told he was close enough to be at risk. He hasn't been tested as he didn't meet the criteria and is fine now. 


On the 9 April doc requested flu / whopping cough labs for the CF son - pathology lab also tested for coronavirus even though GP didn't request it. All came back negative. 

Two weeks later CF son is still really sick and has just started 2nd round of a different antibiotic and he had a chest x-ray today. The GP has said it's not coronavirus and thinking perhaps pneumonia - no fever, shortness of breath but very chest wet cough, but I've been reading about corona virus false negatives and wondering should we just go get tested again? The coronavirus can cause pneumonia in some patients.

I'm wondering what the changes are of our son picking up the coronavirus indirectly from my husband and the symptoms presenting so much later (3-5weeks?!) or it is possible he got it off something we've had delivered to the house? 

I'm going a bit crazy wondering how he got so sick staying at home mostly. He has only left the house to go to doctors and drive thru but he has worn a mask. 

Does anyone think this is possible? Of course I am worried it's more than a cold/pneumonia and wondering if we should take him for testing / ER for another opinion if the GP says the results aren't pointing to pneumonia?


Thank you for reading.

 Queensland is fricked It seems that for the past two months, 90% of Queenslanders just have not cared about social distancing. We are so so lucky that we haven't had undetected cases because it would surely spread throughout the state.

The signage at this shop I'm at is extremely clear: only 2 people allowed. I was the second person in the store and just as I was trying to exit, two people pushed past me into the store, violating the 2 person limit and my 1.5 metres. This behaviour is not at all isolated; it seems to be at almost every shop I go to. If an undetected case spills over from the NSW border, we've got no hope. Too many people think the pandemic is over.

 If not us then who? If not now then when. Now is the time to realise that the Australian government cares only for its members and its profiteering associated.  The members governing this country have once again proven their ineptness and inability to do the one job they are paid (very well) to do. It’s time to realise-as a country that democratic government does not work for the majority of people.  We have an opportunity to implement change. Remove the power, money and greed hungry from positions of power and create a new form of government.  One that does not choose to be there making decisions.  But one that deserves and is called on to serve-for a limited term -as servants to the people to whose lives they will endeavour to improve with every decision.  If not us then who.  If not now then when.
