 I know the PM is touting smaller growth of new confirmed cases, but have they actually changed any of the testing criteria? How can we trust the data if they haven’t? I’m thinking particularly for states like NSW and maybe Vic where there is evidence of community transmission, but even as of 3 days ago when I spoke to my doctor, they still had strict criteria on who can and can’t be tested, and it was still mostly targeted at overseas travel.

 Daily Tests/Positive Ratio 15th Sept Daily 0.48% positivity ratio, 42 cases on 8803 Test results  
14 Day Avg: 0.42%, 60 Cases, 14733 Tests

&amp;#x200B;



Note: I do this on the actual new cases / the number of reported tests. Some other places do it on the 'net new' cases. I prefer this way, as this is the daily snapshot. This way will give slightly higher ratios, and is probably pessimistic about the 14d average. It's important you, the reader, understand what the difference is. A positivity ratio of 1% does not imply that 1% of the wider population is infected - the tests are not of a random sample of the population.
