 School. So I'm a Year 12 student in high school and the virus is causing students to work from home and their parents to keep them home.

Today there was only 10 year 12s and theres about 60 in my school, we were told that if we wanted to sign out and go home we could as there was minimal students attending.

All of our work has been put onto our online hub for school.

I just wanted to give a little insight as to what it is like being a student in all this mess. Thanks for listening!

 A teacher at Epping Boys High School that closed today after a student tested positive,is due to get married tomorrow. It was unsure if it would go ahead, because staff and students were told to self isolate. The health department has declared it can now go ahead as there was no close contact   

Wedding gets green-light after school shuts

Coronavirus fears have almost ruined a woman’s wedding day after Epping Boys High School was closed on Thursday night when a student was diagnosed with the virus.

The wedding of a female teacher at the school came into question on Friday after students and staff were told to self isolate after the outbreak. 

“Even though (the education department) asked these teachers to isolate over the weekend, well there's a tricky situation. One teacher from that school, Epping Boys High, is getting married,” Ben Fordham said on 2GB. 

“It’s the biggest day of her life. Her family, friends and loved ones are ready for the big day. Her dress is ready, the groom is ready, the photographer’s booked, the wedding cake is being baked. But the star of the show, the beautiful bride has been ordered to isolate along with all (Epping Boys) teachers.” 

The health department confirmed with the broadcaster that the teacher had not been in close contact with the infected student and the risk of spreading the infection was low. 

The wedding will be followed by a reception at Taronga Zoo will go ahead on Saturday while Epping Boys undergoes decontamination over the weekend.

 Investigations into how the 16-year-old student contracted the virus continue.

 NSW Gov: Free tutoring to support students *10 November 2020*  
The Premier

\--

**For the first time in NSW, students will receive free tutoring in 2021 thanks to a landmark $337 million program that is part of the NSW 2020-21 Budget.**

The program increases the ongoing support for students’ education after a disruptive school year.

The Government is employing up to 5500 additional staff to deliver small-group teaching at every NSW government school, as well as non-government schools with the most significant levels of need.

NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said people in NSW are working hard to recover from the pandemic, and the Government is committed to ensuring students’ educational outcomes continue to improve in 2021.

&gt;“2020 has been a tough year, particularly for our students and teachers who did an incredible job despite a disrupted year that included seven weeks of remote learning due to COVID-19, and in some areas that came on top of bushfires and floods,” Ms Berejiklian said.

The Department of Education will support schools to identify students who would benefit the most from this intensive support, tailoring it to their requirements.

Minister for Education and Early Childhood Learning, Sarah Mitchell today called for educators across the State to express their interest in being part of this historic effort  
including; casual and retired teachers, final year teaching students, and university tutors including PhD candidates who are already teaching undergraduate classes at university. 

&gt;“We know that learning for many students stagnated during the pandemic and tuition in small groups will help re-engage our students in their schooling,” Ms Mitchell said.   
&gt;  
&gt;“This program is designed to have maximum impact on student outcomes, because small-group tuition rapidly accelerates student learning.” 

**Key features of the COVID learning support package include:**

* $306 million to provide small-group tuition for eligible students across every NSW government school – primary, secondary and Schools for Specific Purposes (SSPs)
* $31 million for non-government schools with the greatest levels of need to provide small-group tuition
* The program will begin in Term 1, 2021 and run throughout the school year.

Treasurer Dominic Perrottet said the program would see a boost in employment for casual and part-time teachers and university tutors.

&gt;“This program will not only support our students in their education but will also provide unprecedented employment opportunities for qualified teachers and university tutors who may be short on work,” Mr Perrottet said.  
&gt;  
&gt;“We will also make sure our rural and remote school leaders can access the expert additional staff members they need to implement the program successfully,” Ms Mitchell added.

The COVID intensive learning support program is the latest measure in the NSW Government’s strategy to improve literacy and numeracy outcomes and ensure that every school and every student can improve every year.

 WA schools to cease formal classes on April 3  

WA Premier Mark McGowan says from now until next Friday, all children who attend public schools will continue to be taught.  
 

&gt;*"However, the State Government encourages families to keep their children at home if they can access the online or other resources for the education of their children to continue.*   
   
*"Children of people who need their children to attend school, to enable them to maintain employment and those children in vulnerable families, like children living with grandparents, are encouraged to attend school. Formal classes will now finish at the end of Friday, April 3."*

He says arrangements will be in place in schools to supervise children who need to attend school on the last four days prior to Easter.  Education Minister Sue Ellery says students who stay at home will be required to use online learning. 

&gt;*"In the week of the 6th of  April, teachers and education assistants and other school staff begin the preparation for what education in a combination of physical school settings and distance and online education will look like in term 2.*  
   
*"Students who attend, again, because their parents need them to attend so they can maintain their jobs, will be supervised, not taught.*  
   
*"Schools will continue to manage vulnerable staff members, no students will be turned away from schools if they attend."*

 They just enforced "one person per 4 square metres." Our classrooms are generally 81 square metres in size (9x9m), up to 100 square metres (10x10m).

We have 27 students in our class, plus a teacher.

If each of those people needs 4 square metres of space;

81 / 4 = 20.25

100/ 4 = 25

Again, 27 students. There is NOT enough space. Yet, schools aren't cancelled. What the fuck?

 Why does nsw department of education make us go to school when it is unsafe? So at my school parents don’t social distance at the gate and kids can’t get past without getting close.

some of the kids say their parents just want them to get the corona and get it over with because it’s a cold.

some of the parents hug hello at the gate

some of the teachers do not social distance from each other or us

some of the students and parents say bill gates caused it and other stupid things

some post pictures on Facebook of them out not social distancing

but when a student doesn’t feel safe they are forced to go to school by the nsw department of education into the unsafe environment.

why aren’t the unsafe people banned from the school so the people doing the right thing can go without anxiety?

 Schools in Victoria to close for two days to allow teachers to prepare for remote learning during coronavirus outbreak. The days of closure will be the last day of term 1 and the first day of term 2  

Public school students in Victoria will be asked to stay home for two days to allow teachers to prepare to run classes remotely in the event of schools being asked to shut down at the peak of the pandemic.

Schools were told that the last day of term one, next Friday, and the first day of term two, would be pupil-free. 

In a notice to public schools released yesterday, Education Department deputy secretary Dr David Howes said schools needed to "consolidate their preparations" for a total shut down.

"Teachers and schools are working hard to prepare for the possibility that we will need to move at some stage to more flexible learning arrangements, including remote learning," he said.

[Earlier on Friday, schools were advised that NAPLAN tests were cancelled due to the disruption of coronavirus, but schools were advised to remain open.](

"The decision to not proceed with NAPLAN in 2020 has been taken to assist school leaders, teachers and support staff to focus on the wellbeing of students and continuity of education, including potential online and remote learning," the Education Council said.

 A message to anybody learning or teaching high school maths/physics With schools facing potential closures due to COVID-19, many students are having to face learning in a completely different environment to what they’re used to, and teachers are having to adapt their practice to accommodate this. In addition, while some schools are transitioning to online instruction, some others may not have the resources to provide it. I’m fortunate that the resources (powerpoint classes) I’ve made over my career lend themselves well to digital learning. I have classes made for Years 7-9 maths, Years 10-11 methods and Years 11-12 Physics. If you know anybody who could use resources to help them learn or teach more effectively in this time, share this link (I promise it’s not spam) with them.

 Covid 19 and a teacher I'm a teacher in queensland and or schools are still open. They are saying that its better for kids to be at school and they will only get the virus mildly. But what about us teachers? There are many elderly or with underlying health conditions. Should teachers be given PPE such as masks, gloves, sanitiser if we continue to be open?
++++++++++
 Unpopular Opinion: Schools don't need to close! People are circle jerking that schools need to close just because every country is doing it but there are consequences for this, we are talking about first and foremost low socioeconomic students where school is the only place where they can get basic needs covered, then we need to think of people who work in essential services who will be forced to stay home because the kids have to stay home which in turn would lead, for example, the capacity for the healthcare system to handle any substantial increase in cases. I believe that schools will close eventually, but it needs to be graded. e.g introduce screening at schools, kids  at risk are identified and not allowed entry to the school and if there is a confirmed case, then the school closes down, no need to close down the whole school system in the whole continent just because johnny in a small school in suburban bondi contracted corona.

Mawson Lakes School and Preschool will be closed on Monday 16 November following SA Health advice that a student who attends the school is a close contact to someone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19.

Out of an abundance of caution and in accordance with SA Health guidance the site will shut for a minimum of 24 hours. People who need to self-isolate will be contacted with further instructions. 

A thorough clean of all relevant areas will be carried out.

 Anyone else worried about Melb schools reopening on Monday? Maybe I’m just overly cautious, but feel very anxious about primary schools reopening while there’s not insignificant community transmission in Melbourne. 

I roughly estimate there are around 450,000 primary kids in Melbourne metro. This represents 450,000 individual opportunities for the virus to spread between families. 

Schools have officially announced that they do not expect to be able to police social distancing. To add to that, it is becoming increasingly clear that children are actually silent COVID super-spreaders (as they are for most other bugs!) [

I feel like most families have learned to adapt to WFH and home learning and it would have been smarter to wait until community transmission was very very low before we open the lid on school Petri dishes!!

Maybe Dan will announce a delay on this tomorrow, but somehow I doubt it. I hope I’m wrong but feel there’s a very good chance this will lead to Victoria’s third wave!

My girlfriend wants to do an Airbnb next month July just the two of us and my family who I live with say I shouldn't go because of the virus and stuff and just wait. I understand completely because for starters one family member is a diabetic and works in age care so if I was to go to an Airbnb where I would have no idea who previously stayed there or how clean it is it could greatly affect my family situation if something were to happen. But now I would upset my girlfriend because I would turn down a trip and just would cause an argument with her so now I don't know what to do.

 Schools need to close  

I teach over 200 kids a day (sometimes more) in a school of about 1000 (wow, that's over 500). Now, this is just my little rant about the issue of keeping public schools open and by no means is it actually guided by scientific studies. It is purely my opinion and there could many flaws and no one might even read this. However, I feel that teachers have little say and we all feel the fear of speaking out (but thank you teacher's federation for your efforts).

The arguments about keeping schools open are just plain dumb. Schools aren't just made up of children, there are teachers, cleaners, general assistants and office staff and more. Ask any of us and we will tell you that a school is the perfect place to spread germs (the flu gets spread at least once a year in a school; no it's not scientific, it's just based on experience).

Now the government's main issue for keeping schools open is that it's safer?

\- Children will run around and spread covid-19 to the public by hanging out in big groups at the park and shopping centres? How is that any different to before and after school? Do we not trust that our children and parents of the children to keep them at home as if they were at school? Are they rabid animals who hang around in gangs of 30 and terrorise everyone around them with the threat of viruses by coughing and sneezing on people?

\- They need supervision/ parents can't all stay home to look after them. Well Sherlock, some parents are at home already and some have been sent home. Schools should be left open for kids who have no other options (no parents /no access to technology/HSC related work that needs face to face instruction or the like). Not only does this cut down on numbers, it means that any kid walking around in public should be at home or at school just like any other school day. This isn't a holiday. This is a lockdown.

\- Children don't apparate into school. They walk or take public transport. Some travel a fair distance. Just because a kid is at school, doesn't mean that they're never out in public. Kids dominate public transport before and after school (I apologise to the public in advance) and now we've increased the number of people who are in the line of exposure. Well done.

\- Big companies such as CBA, Telstra, Macquarie, NBN, Tabcorp and many more, have sent their non-essential staff to work from home because they understand that it reduces the chances of spreading. They haven’t closed nor have they continued at 100% load. Why can’t schools do the same??? No more than 500 people in a gathering (haha, have you been in a public school before?). What a joke.

Now I know that there are some parents who are wanting their kids at school and there are definitely parents who aren't able to stay home to look after young children. However, this is a pandemic. We are trying to limit the numbers of people catching this NOT BECAUSE THEY WILL DIE but because THEY WILL SPREAD IT. Schools should stay open for only the absolutely essential kids with no face to face teaching but just supervision for them to do their work and otherwise, there needs to be arrangements made for kids to not be in large class groups (1.5metres apart. Ha. Good one. Have you met children? Have you seen schools?)

Tl;dr Schools are over 500 people. Close them.

 EBHS Principal Tim O'Brien - GET BACK TO SCHOOL GUYS ! EBHS Principal Tim O'Brien  - GET BACK TO SCHOOL GUYS !  

"Dear Parents/Caregivers,

Whilst we understand that many in our community hold significant concerns about COVID-19, it is important that in line with the advice from NSW Health and the Department of Education that except for those who are confirmed close contacts, **all other students should be at school."**

  

"Parents who are choosing to keep their child at home because they are concerned about the risk of COVID-19 need to be realistic about their expectations of teachers and, importantly, ensure they comply with the school expectations regarding absences, especially in terms of missed assessment tasks. **See attached for the Middle and Senior School Assessment Guidelines for your information.**

TRANSLATION  - if you don't go to school we will still fail you.  So you choose whether you want to pass or risk getting the virus !  You can't do both at EBHS !

While experts and government consider stricter social distancing and closures EBHS goes the other way.

 NSW Health report tracking coronavirus cases in schools finds no teachers infected by students RELATED STORY: There's a lesson for our leaders in the debate over schoolsRELATED STORY: Schools are open for essential workers but are you one? Here's what happens for term twoRELATED STORY: Teachers say they've been 'thrown to the sharks' — but Morrison is standing firm
A highly anticipated report into the spread of COVID-19 in classrooms, relied on by the Federal Government to fast-track the reopening of schools, indicates the disease has very limited transmissibility between students, and from students to teachers.

Key points:

The report discovered two secondary infections in students, who are believed to have caught the virus at school
NSW Education Minister Sarah Mitchell said the report will be released to schools to help them plan for a staggered return
According to the NSW Government, only 1.7 per cent of COVID-19 infections have occurred among school aged children
Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy cited the report on Friday at a press conference with Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who stressed that social distancing measures did not need to be followed in schools.

The findings of NSW Health's Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance (NCIRS), tracked the spread of 18 cases — 9 teachers and 9 students — across 15 schools.

The study, led by NCIRS director Kristine Macartney and soon to be peer reviewed, analysed the tests of 863 close contacts of the infections, interactions which occurred between early March and April 21.

It also discovered two secondary infections in students, who are believed to have caught the virus at school.

"Our investigation found no evidence of children infecting teachers. One secondary case [in the child in a high school] was presumed to have been infected following close contact with two student cases," Professor Macartney wrote.

"The other secondary case was presumed to have been infected by a staff member [teacher]."
Coronavirus questions answered

Coronavirus questions answered
Breaking down the latest news and research to understand how the world is living through an epidemic, this is the ABC's Coronacast podcast.
Australian Education Union federal president Correna Haythorpe said on Friday the decision to reopen schools was ill-conceived.

"Today's updated guidelines do not provide a solution in terms of creating a safe environment for teachers, principals and support staff in schools," Ms Haythorpe said.

"To announce the scrapping of school social distance guidelines on the Friday before students return to school in all states and territories is beyond comprehension."

'Schools remain open and are safe for students to return'

Mr Morrison has repeatedly said teachers face a greater risk in the staffroom than the classroom — and it appears this report is the basis for that.

"It is notable that half of the initial cases that occurred in schools were in staff. This is consistent with the higher rate of COVID-19 seen in adults than in children," Professor Macartney concludes.

"It is also important for all adults, including teachers, to follow the social distancing practices while at school and in the community."

NSW Education Minister Sarah Mitchell said the report will be released to schools later today to help them plan for a staggered return to school.

"We know that COVID-19 has created some anxiety for parents, teachers and school staff, however, the findings in this report confirm existing health advice that schools remain open and are safe for students to return," Ms Mitchell said.

According to the findings of the NSW Government, while school-aged children are 16 per cent of the population, only 1.7 per cent of COVID-19 infections have been in this age group.

Students in NSW are expected to begin returning to school one day a week from May 11.

"Our managed return to school provides an orderly pathway to return students to the classroom, and allows for additional measures for teachers and parents," Ms Mitchell said.

"[Our teachers] have shown great innovation in adapting to the uncertainty that COVID-19 has brought, but nothing replaces the experience of learning in a classroom."

Professor Macartney said the report builds on evidence from abroad, indicating a reduced transmissibility of COVID-19 between children, or from children to adults.

"A unique aspect of this work is that we were able to look specifically for spread in schools over many weeks and utilise additional testing methods," Professor Macartney said.

"We appreciate the cooperation of the students, families, teachers and principals who really saw the value of systematically and scientifically approaching the investigation."[ABC News Report](

 ACT: Temperature checks for ANU students  

ANU has begun rolling out temperature checks for residential students at its colleges as a response to the coronavirus outbreak.

The Canberra university is also rostering the use of communal spaces and enforcing a 1.5m distance between students.

“Students must also keep the time they spend in shared dining spaces to less than 45 minutes,” a spokesman said.

The university paused teaching this week and will resume remote learning next week, but some residential students are choosing to remain on campus.

“We advised any students in residences who want to return home they are welcome to do so. Our residences will remain open for any student who continues to want to live on campus.”

The spokesman said 1000 students had chosen to leave the campus accommodation.

 Schools Open For Infection!!!! Discussion/Rant ***One Day Is All It Takes.***

Our PM is not looking after school staff or Australia's children.

By saying if you have a job, you can send your child to school for the economy's sake is ridiculous. A lot of children at school do not take this pandemic seriously they don't understand the implications of this virus.

Children do not show the symptoms as much as others, if any at all.

most families I can say consist of two children if one child were to contract COVID-19 theres 14 days of glorious incubation time where symptoms may not show. during this time should your child be attending school ( say they are in year 2) they will sit with their 20 odd classmates where social distancing is not possible due to small classrooms. during lunch they tend to spend 15+ mins during lunch and recess playing with children from other classes, maybe friends up one grade or down a grade. then your child will go home after 6 hours of crowded contact with their classmates. and spend time with their sibling that doesn't have COVID-19 yet. They spend well over 15+min together playing/fighting whatever most siblings do at home. Now your year 5 child starts spreading the virus to her class for 13 days.

Now COVID-19 has a nice trip home with other students and families.

The Australian Average School size is about 470 students plus 40+ school staff. the average household as of 2016 is 2.6 (let round that to 3).

1530 people now have to be quarantined, as **SCHOOL STAFF CANNOT CONFIRM WHO HAS BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THAT CHILD FOR 15 + MINUTES OVER THE LAST 14 DAYS.**

Yet Scomo says, let close play lands and birthday parties, no more than 10 in a space. while classrooms are double that.

Personally we are f\*&amp;(ed.

 Please stop sending your son or daughter to school NOW Now is the time to act. Countries are closing down schools every second. The UK closed all their schools indefinitely. Our Prime Minister is slack idiot who wants to keep schools open just because of his own daughters. **He will close schools only if his daughters get the coronavirus.**

This idiot (ScoMo) follows Singapore‘s advice, a tiny little island nation that has only 25 schools (Primary and High combined) nationwide, while Australia has 10,607 schools (Primary and High Combined).  


As a former teacher and a former advisor to an Education minister, I can tell you it is certainly NOT okay to send your kids to school.    
Many parents and guardians are withdrawing their children from school every day. Join them. Phone, text or send an email to the school and education department that you are worried about your child’s safety.

And make sure you 🖕Scott Morrison for keeping schools open and risking children’s safety just to save the economy, when everyone knows that it will go into a recession anyway.

And there are plenty of online teaching and tutoring services online to continue learning such as zoom.us

 Another affected student /school in Sydney. This time a Year 7 student at Willoughby Girls High School. Three students have been diagnosed with coronavirus among six new cases across NSW.

A boy and girl at a school in Sydney's west have been confirmed to have the deadly infection, and a girl in the city's north.

The boy and girl are in Year 10 at St Patrick's Marist College in Dundas, near Parramatta, and the other case is a Year 7 student at Willoughby Girls High School.

At the moment St Patrick's Marist College is still open.

Parents have been asked to come and collect their children and the school will be closed tomorrow.

The ABC reports up to 50 students could have had close contact with the two students.

Epping Boys High School, which was closed on Friday after a Year 11 boy tested positive, has reopened today.

There are now 42 cases of COVID-19 across NSW.

 NSW Gov: New COVID-safe guidelines announced for NSW schools 10 November 2020

**Parents and carers will be permitted to attend end of year presentation days in NSW public schools under new COVID-safe guidelines.**

NSW Education Secretary, Mark Scott, today announced additional activities that can take place on school grounds in line with current NSW Health advice.

&gt;“Parents and carers will be able to attend end of year presentation days as we head towards a COVID-safe summer,” Mr Scott said.  
&gt;  
&gt;“P&amp;C meetings at schools can resume from November 12, and students can attend excursions to the ACT from today.”

Mr Scott congratulated schools and their communities for their on-going efforts, and reinforced that more now than ever students, staff, and people entering schools must remain vigilant and practise good hand hygiene.

&gt;“Carefully allowing additional activities to take place at schools will give our school communities a welcome return to some normality in what has been a long and challenging year for our students, educators, parents and carers,” Mr Scott said.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Schools across the state have shown outstanding resilience and flexibility in adapting to the many changes that have taken place this year and they should be applauded for the critical part they have played in the response to the pandemic.  
&gt;  
&gt;“While parents and carers will be able to attend important end of year events in person, including graduations, they will still need to continue to maintain 1.5 metres of physical distance from one another and follow all onsite health measures.  
&gt;  
&gt;“With visitors allowed into schools for some end of year events, it is vitally important that we remain focused and do not become complacent when NSW is doing so well. Schools must continue to follow NSW Health advice which includes maintaining regular hand washing and sanitising, staying home if you have COVID-19 symptoms and get tested immediately.  
&gt;  
&gt;“End of year events, school formals and graduations can be held from 12 November provided they follow department guidelines and NSW Health requirements for COVID-safe events.”

Mr Scott said the safety and wellbeing of students and staff remains the priority as we head towards the end of the school year.

“In the final weeks of the 2020 school year, it is extremely important that we continue the outstanding efforts of schools and the community to stay COVID safe so that we can all enjoy a well-deserved break and COVID-safe summer.”

 Parents are pulling their children out of schools that neighbour the affected Sydney schools  Worried parents rushed to Willoughby Public School on Monday morning to pull their children out of class after the NSW government closed the neighbouring high school because a year 7 student was diagnosed with COVID-19.

The public primary school informed parents via email that NSW Health had closed Willoughby Girls High “until further notice” and that they could pick their children up if they were concerned about the spread of the virus.

Louise Relf, whose two children, Zoe, 9 and Fletcher, 7, attend Willoughby Public, told The Australian she had decided to take her children out of school as a “precaution.”

“I was a bit worried when the school told us that Willoughy Girls had been closed down because of the coronavirus,” she said. “I think it’s better to be safe than sorry"

 It's a start, 'Victorian public school students to be kept home for two days' 


Victorian public school students will be asked to stay home for two days to allow teachers to prepare to run classes remotely, in case the coronavirus pandemic escalates.

Schools were told late on Friday that the last day of term one (next Friday) and the first day of term two would be pupil-free days.

During those two days, teachers will finalise preparations to run classes remotely should schools shut down at the peak of the pandemic.

"Teachers and schools are working hard to prepare for the possibility that we will need to move at some stage to more flexible learning arrangements, including remote learning," Dr David Howes, Education Department deputy secretary said in a notice to public schools.

This will provide an important opportunity for schools to consolidate their preparations."

Dr Howes said schools were already prepared to teach remotely but "it won't always be perfect, and we will learn as we go".

Principals have also been asked to support vulnerable teachers and staff who need to work from home to minimise their exposure.

The notice, seen by The Age, repeated that schools would be open next week as anxiety about spreading the coronavirus within schools festered.

On Thursday, Victoria's Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton said schools needed to remain open this early in the outbreak

There is not widespread community transmission at this point, and levels of COVID-19 illness are likely to be very low," Dr Sutton said.

"Children who are at all unwell are advised to be at home, and schools and teachers should exclude any unwell children who present to school. Any children with undetected symptoms are likely to be minimally infectious.

"The evidence is reviewed daily and advice will continue to be tailored to the evidence."

Earlier on Friday, it was revealed NAPLAN tests had been canned for the year. The tests – taken annually by children in years 3, 5, 7 and 9 – will resume next year.

The news came as a senior boarder at Geelong Grammar at the Corio campus was diagnosed with coronavirus.

Five school parents have also tested positive, having attended a cocktail night for parents of year 9 students at the Timbertop campus.

 To close or not to close (schools) Why is the idea of closing schools or keeping them open an all or nothing option? Are there any discussions about schools operating on partial capacity? Eg, kids do their schooling at home who can, but those who's parents are working can still attend school. Could that help?

 Hunter schools enforce social distancing as teacher is exposed 

&gt;A NEWCASTLE Grammar School teacher has self-isolated after their friend was found to have COVID-19.

&gt;Head of School Erica Thomas wrote to parents on Sunday to tell them the year six teacher had come into contact with a confirmed case. The school is following NSW Health advice.

&gt;Ms Thomas told the Newcastle Herald the teacher was in Sydney last week with friends, including one who was confirmed on Saturday to have COVID-19.

&gt;"The teacher had contact with students and staff last week and had no idea he had come into contact with the virus the weekend before," Ms Thomas said.


&gt;"The teacher continues to exhibit no symptoms.

&gt;"We have cleaned all areas the teacher was in thoroughly, communicated directly with parents of the students he was most in contact with, phoned any parent where we knew the child or parent might because of other health complications be concerned, and informed staff."

&gt;Schools across the Hunter - including Newcastle Grammar - started rolling out social distancing measures on Monday, such as staggering break times and cancelling a range of events, from assemblies to sports carnivals, excursions, parent teacher interviews, Harmony Day and Easter hat parades.

&gt;"The school in the modern era has never dealt with a health crisis of this magnitude"," Ms Thomas said.

&gt;"As a community we need to protect those that are most at risk - while younger people seem to be less impacted if they contract the virus - we don't want to be responsible for passing it on to their grandparents."

The practicality of social distancing in a school setting and the question of school closures aside: community transmission in this context is a thing that we don't seem to be taking seriously enough at all.  Or in any context really.

 Online learning resources (high school maths/physics)  Posted before but given recent news, posting again:

With schools facing potential closures due to COVID-19, many students are having to face learning in a completely different environment to what they’re used to, and teachers are having to adapt their practice to accommodate this. In addition, while some schools are transitioning to online instruction, some others may not have the resources to provide it. I’m fortunate that the resources (powerpoint classes) I’ve made over my career lend themselves well to digital learning. I have classes made for Years 7-9 maths, Years 10-11 methods and Years 11-12 Physics. If you know anybody who could use resources to help them learn or teach more effectively in this time, share this link (I promise it’s not spam) with them.

 Third Melbourne primary school forced to close after child tests positive to COVID-19 

“A third Melbourne school has been forced to close this week after a child tested positive to coronavirus, among nine new cases in Victoria in the past day.

The pupil attends Strathmore Primary School in the state's north-west.


It comes after two Melbourne primary schools were forced to close because of an outbreak linked to one family spread across three suburbs on Monday.

One new coronavirus case had been linked to the cluster spread across five households in Coburg, Broadmeadows and Pakenham, with 12 family members testing positive to the virus so far.
The family is understood to have had recent gatherings which resulted in four children contracting COVID-19.


Two of the children attend Pakenham Springs Primary School in Melbourne's south-east, while another two attend St Dominic's Primary School in Broadmeadows. Both schools have been shut as extensive cleaning and contact tracing is undertaken.”
++++++++++
 What is the governments overall plan in controlling the virus? I have heard that there is a goal to have everyone eventually exposed to the virus to build immunity. Is this correct or is something like a vaccine more likely? 

Something that supported that theory was something about people having immunity cards. 

Anyone know any info?

 Melbourne high school closes after student tests positive **Keilor Downs College** in Melbourne's north-west has closed for at least 24 hours after a student tested positive for coronavirus, just four days after senior students returned to classrooms.

It comes after a teacher at the school tested positive last Friday, although they had not been at school.

A **St Albans Secondary College** student and six students at **Taylors Lakes Secondary College** have been identified as close contacts of the infected student.

"These students took part in a class at Keilor Downs Secondary College. These students will self isolate,” an Education Department spokesman said.

"[The Health Department] has advised there is no need for either school to close or for staff or students to take any further precautionary action other than what has already been communicated to the broader Victorian community."

Keilor Downs College will be closed for at least 24 hours while authorities carry out contact tracing, and the school is cleaned.

"Further investigations are being undertaken ... to identify whether any staff or students are required to self-isolate, and to determine any further actions required to reduce the risk of infection," the department spokesman said.

There is no evidence of a link between the student and the staff member who had previously tested positive.

"The teacher was not infectious when they were on-site," the statement read.

"We wish the student and their family a speedy recovery.

 Online high school tutoring I don't know if this is appropriate or not, so feel free to delete:  


I'm a VCE Chemistry tutor, currently studying science and engineering at a university in Melbourne. I know that a lot of kids are being pulled out of school, and some of my students schools are imminently closing.   
If you, or your children would like lessons, I can offer to do online classes for them over video chat (I don't necessarily have to see the child, but they will see me). I have a valid Working With Childrens card. 

I'm just throwing my hat in there, to see if this is something that people might think is helpful with all the school closures/keeping kids out of school. Learning must go on if possible, and we have the technological resources to do so.

I can also offer some math tutoring, or even junior and middle high school tutoring.  
Please message me if you've got any questions, and we can see if we can arrange something.  
Thanks!

 A message to anybody learning or teaching high school maths/physics With schools facing potential closures due to COVID-19, many students are having to face learning in a completely different environment to what they’re used to, and teachers are having to adapt their practice to accommodate this. In addition, while some schools are transitioning to online instruction, some others may not have the resources to provide it. I’m fortunate that the resources (powerpoint classes) I’ve made over my career lend themselves well to digital learning. I have classes made for Years 7-9 maths, Years 10-11 methods and Years 11-12 Physics. If you know anybody who could use resources to help them learn or teach more effectively in this time, share this link (I promise it’s not spam) with them.

 "Children are not giving this disease to their parents, the parents are giving to it the children." - QLD CMO Queensland's chief medical officer Jeanette Young has been quoted as saying: 

&gt; Looking at the evidence, we have not seen outbreaks in schools, we haven’t seen them in Australia, we haven’t seen them overseas.

&gt; Where children have got it, when we’ve worked back through how they got it, they got it from their parents.

&gt; Children are not giving this disease to their parents, the parents are giving to it the children. 

&gt; This is not flu.

 What's going to happen about university students? I live in Victoria and I go to Swinburne, but Andrews didn't say anything about university students, only school students for going back. As far as I know, Scomo will have to tell Andrews to tell the CEO of Swinburne (Of all Victorian campus') that it is safe to go back. But this got me thinking, will university students go back the same time as other schools or at the same time as workers?

 Melbourne primary schools remain open after parents test positive. A parent at Kensington Primary School, and a parent at Newport Gardens Primary, have both tested positive to the virus. However, parents have been told the schools will stay open, based on the advice of the DHHS.  

Two primary schools in Melbourne’s inner west have reported confirmed cases of COVID-19 in their communities, but will remain open.

A parent at Kensington Primary School, and a parent at Newport Gardens Primary, have both tested positive to the virus.

However, parents have been told the schools will stay open, based on the advice of the Department of Health and Human Services.

“DHHS has advised that there is no need for our school to close or for staff or students to take any further precautionary action,” parents and carers at Kensington Primary were told.

“We encourage all our students and staff to attend school as normal and for the community to support each other during this time.”

It follows the closure of Middle Park Primary School today after a staff member tested positive.

The school will close for at least 24 hours. It is the second Victorian state school to close due a case among staff, following Toorak Primary School’s closure earlier this week.

More than 30 independent Victorian schools have closed or announced plans to close and shift to remote learning, mostly as a precaution.

 Fears at Perth school (Tranby College) as father of a student is exposed to a confirmed coronavirus case. Both student and father have since developed flu-like symptoms. They are awaiting test result which are expected early next week. The school has asked anyone with symptoms to self isolate  [ 

 

A private school in Perth is also taking precautions over coronavirus.

Tranby College has told students and parents that a father has exposed to a colleague with COVID-19.

"Both he and one of his children have both now fallen ill with flu-like symptoms. The entire family is now in self-imposed isolation pending test results which are expected early next week," Principal Clayton Massey said in a letter.

"I am now giving direction that anyone with the above symptoms self-isolates and does not attend the College until they have attended a testing clinic and returned a negative test for the virus."
