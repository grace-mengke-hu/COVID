 Australia is currently 32nd in the world in confirmed cases, but only 52nd in the world by confirmed number of deaths This shows that we're detecting a large amount of our cases (particularly the symptomatic ones), and with our hospitals not being overloaded everyone has a fighting chance at beating this this so far.  

I'm cautiously optimistic...but this could change at any moment

 Melbournian here. Just wanted to type out how i feel. Doesnt matter if you dont wanna read it just needed to type somewhere where people may understand. I dont watch the press confrences i find it easier to just catch up on a news site later on. As i read yesterday the road map for us i wasnt surprised really. We knew we were not going to be pleasently surprised. I did turn the tv on in the arvo with my cup of coffee i look forward to everyday after i wake up (yes in the arvo,what else is there to do? Im pregnant and tired so why not sleep).
And the press conference was on and i had this feeling again as i do when i think hard about the situation we are in and i still think "wow,im still not used to the pandemic but at the same time i cant really remember the feeling of a completly nornal life either". 

Im not here to type out where vic went wrong or why anyone thinks danial andrews sucks or anything like that im just feeling a bit miserable and would like this space to talk how i feel even though im just one out of many. Yes,im aware there is lifeline and beyond blue. 

Im feeling kind of numb but i just recently started up my anto depressants again so that could be why. Theres a comfort in knowing theres other people struggling too.
Knowing that its going to be a long road makes the struggle even harder. Theres not much good on tv, the masked singer ad said "australias favorite guessing game" and quite frankly i wish they didnt include me in that because i think its embaraasing show and who approves this shit?

I miss the gym bad,im a person who has always had self confidence issues and i got in great shape then the gyms closed and i got pregnant and its hard to tell whats pregnancy changes or if im just fucking fat!
You cant even get excited for whatever you have ordered online because it takes so friggin long to arrive that by the time its near,the excitment is gone.

All i do everyday is clean the house,washing and cook. Sometimes i go for a walk and sometimes i do some home body excersises but i never feel like its worth it as i was super into weight training at the gym. Its seriously everything to me.
Im feeling ugly. I feel like i dont trust anyone.
