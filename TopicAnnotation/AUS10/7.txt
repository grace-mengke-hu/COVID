 Has anyone who is immunocompromised gotten advice from their doctor? So I am immunocompromised (on some meds for a condition) and I was wondering if anyone who is also immunocompromised has received advice from their doctor about what they should be doing.

I am getting off of holiday in a week (stayed at home for them, so no travel) and while I have an appointment to see my doctor the earliest was after I go back. Was hoping for any info people may have.

I live in NSW if that's relevant.

 No work till end of yr, boss offers us Jobkeeper, suddenly rostered on to "make gifts for clients" Hello there.
I would love your advice. 

Without going into specifics, i work for a company with a small team of workers. I wont say which feild as my company could be easily identified.

Our work comes from clients who require the services of my team. My boss is the one who gets the work for us to do - he works in an office with a few staff who organize work with clients, which my team and i go out and do.

Now, all clients have cancelled upcoming work until the end of the year. My boss told us last week, we had better go get centrelink as there is no work until the last months of the year at best. He even wrote letters 4 us to take to c-link saying as much.
The very next day "Jobkeeper " came about. 
My boss asked us all if we would like to go ahead with this "Jobkeeper" allowance, whereby the ATO pays a set amount of money each week to all of us, through him. He worded himself strangely. He said he could "guarantee us 3 days a week work coming to $750 before tax for the next 6 m." 

I felt pressured to give an answer and also confused. He can't guarantee us work, I thought. There is no work. I figured he must mean he will pass on this money, he meant he could give us this government money, rather than us have to line up at Centrelink etc. 
So I said yes, and thank you. 
Anyway I have now discovered I am rostered on to work this coming week. As it turns out, my boss is going to make me work for clients that aren't paying him, as "gifts" to the clients.

In doing so I will be required to go to busy places to conduct my work. I wish i could explain where, but just know it will be around lots of people. Even now. 

I would love to know your opinions on this. If only I had trusted my gut, I could have gone to centrelink and gotten jobseeker allowance like many others i know, but now I fear because i have said yes to Jobkeeper, c link will think I am turning down work. 
But in reality, I am going to be working as gifts for clients my boss wants to schmooze up to. 
These clients are large businesses. It seems i am at the beck and call of my boss and am required to do anything he likes at risk to my own health and direct benefit to himself (as HE is not paying me) and I feel I have no choice but to do this. 

I feel so angry and such a huge degree of resentment for my boss who is in a great situation financially and wont be risking his life. 

Do you think the Jobseeker allowance presents opportunities for employees to exploit staff?
If I am fired / quit I won't be able to get centrelink (jobseeker) for 9 weeks which is a huge cost to myself I can't really afford.

 Aus government: stay home; SA dept of Ed: Nah, fuck that SA department of education have advised parents that OSHC will be running as normal these school holidays and it’s not only for essential workers. We will have up to 60 kids a day, no playground because they’ve closed it, no incursions or excursions, just a bunch of kids sitting in a room being told to move away from each other. 

Please keep your children home if you can.

 Jobkeeper on a 3-day work week? So my company is reducing hours from a 5 day week to 3 days due to lack of work and is hoping to receive the jobkeeper. Jobkeeper will be able to pay about 2 days for each employee per week (approx).

The possible scenarios:
1. We stay on 3 days and jobkeeper pays about 2 days of that. (3 days work, 3 days pay)
2. We stay on 3 days, but jobkeeper help give us our full wage (3 days work, 5 days pay)
3. We return to 5 days work and jobkeeper helps with 2 days pay (5 days work, 5 days pay). In this scenario we still only have 3 days worth of work so the boss sees this as a way to do training or housekeeping care of the government.

Easy to tell which the boss wants and which we want. How should it actually work?

 Safest and quickest way to get tested? Hey

As the title suggests, I seem to have developed some symptoms of corona and think I need to get tested.

While I haven't visited any of the actual business that are listed in the Sydney hotspot list (yet...), I have visited the hotspots areas (Campbelltown and Liverpool) and have spent alot of time on public transport the past couple of days.

I contacted my local GP (via a phone appointment) and he gave me a referral go to a private pathology testing centre (4cyte) .

He did warn me that there is a a significant backlog and that getting results will take a while. He also said that the results go straight to the clinic instead of me and that I would have to call to get the results.

Is that legit?

 I was think of going to a hospital or government collection site but would like to minimise the chances of accidentally contracting from someone there. I also don't want to stay in line for 3 hours with potentially infected people around me. 

Any thoughts or comments?
