 Daily Tests/Positive Ratio and 14day best case, 9th Sept Daily 0.46% positivity ratio, 76 cases on 16686 Test results   
14 Day Avg: 0.53%, 84 Cases, 16492 Tests 

&amp;#x200B;



Current 14d thresholds are currently 50 and 5.  
For 50 cases, the earliest we can reach this is 14th Sept, assuming no new cases from now (one day later than yesterday). This step is currently driven by the date (28th Sept).  
For 5 cases, the earliest we can reach this is 22nd Sept, assuming no new cases from now (one day later than yesterday). This step is currently driven by the date (26th Oct).

Note: I do this on the actual new cases / the number of reported tests. Some other places do it on the 'net new' cases. I prefer this way, as this is the daily snapshot. This way will give slightly higher ratios. It's important you, the reader, understand what the difference is. A positivity ratio of 1% does not imply that 1% of the wider population is infected - the tests are not of a random sample of the population.

 Why are they ONLY asking Health and Aged care workers to not work? So the government is telling Health and Aged care workers not to go to work for 14 days if they have recently returned from Italy or South Korea.

What am I missing? This makes no sense to me!! So... the other travellers can go around as they please, spreading it to others - including Health and Aged care workers!

What sort of containment plan is that?

 QLD records 2 new cases * New cases are 19-year-old women, one from Logan, one from Acacia Ridge.
* Being cared for at the PA Hospital.
* They both travelled together recently, including returning to Brisbane from Melbourne on July 21 via Sydney.
* One of them works at Parklands Christian College. The school is closed as a deep clean is going underway.
* The young women went about their business within the communities that they live in and so there will be a large amount of contact tracing to be done, largely within it the Logan and Springfield areas, including shopping malls, restaurants and a church.
*  Jeanette Young: "The initial investigation is indicating that there were incorrect details on their declaration passes and we are still trying to examine all of those facts and obtain the border declaration passes. Investigation will look at whether that was deliberate or otherwise. Our concern of course is that these people were able to get through the border....I will not get into what they have done as the investigation will determine that."
* Police have launched a criminal investigation as to how the two women managed to travel to Victoria and return to Queensland without going into quarantine.

the growth and doubling time was calculated. Growth is easy to calculate, just dividing today's number with yesterday's number. Doubling time was calculated by taking the geometric seven day moving average of growth and then converting the result to doubling time.

Example: doubling time for 2020-03-10 is

log(2) / ( (log(1.16) + log(1.1) + log(1.15) + log(1.22) + log(1.13) + log(1.23) + log(1.27))/7 ) = 4.2169

 Five-year-old dies of COVID-19 in Britain  

Britain on Saturday reported a record 708 daily deaths from COVID-19, including a five-year-old child, who is thought to be the country’s youngest victim.

The health ministry said 4,313 people who tested positive for the virus in hospital had died, while there were 41,903 confirmed cases by Saturday, up 3,735.

The toll has been steadily increasing by more than 500 deaths a day this week and the country is bracing for an expected peak in the next week to 10 days.

A total of 637 of the latest deaths were in England, the National Health Service (NHS) said.

“Patients were aged between five years and 104 years old. 40 of the 637 patients (aged between 48 and 93 years old) had no known underlying health condition,” it said in a statement.

The NHS said it would not be giving further information about the five-year-old patient at the request of the family.

A 13-year-old boy from London, Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab, died last week, days after testing positive for COVID-19. His family said he had no underlying illnesses.

Senior minister Michael Gove told a daily briefing that the teenager’s mother and siblings were now showing symptoms.

To me, the deaths associated with pneumonia and influenza are about what I'd expect, but deaths due to Dementia and Diabetes are higher than I expected.

 What happens with regional vic if we get under 5 avg. cases before 13/9 I don’t think my maths is off. But with a big donut today the average new cases (14 days) for regional vic is 5.29. If there’s another 0 tomorrow that will drop the average to 4.29. If we get two the step 3 criteria before step 2 starts. What happens?
++++++++++
 Prediction: 964 deaths in Australia by Easter. Assuming a somewhat worse case scenario, if we continue on a trajectory similar to Italy, in 2 weeks time we will have 20,000 confirmed cases of covid19 in the country. If we extend that range by another week we will be roughly where Italy is today: 47,000 cases.
In terms of number of deaths it is looking like we will have lower numbers than Italy. At the 1000 cases mark Italy had 29 deaths. Currently we have 7 deaths. 7÷29 gives us a coefficient of 0.24. At the 20,000 cases mark Italy had 1441 deaths. 1441 × 0.24 gives us 345. Therefore in 2 weeks time when we hit the 20,000 cases mark we will have had roughly 345 deaths. If we extend that by a week we are looking at approximately 964 deaths by April 11.

 Victorian Health Minister: "anticipate 45,000 additional emergency department presentations, 5000 additional hospital admissions and 2000 additional admissions to intensive care units, and that's just for the three-month period" [

Running a back of the envelope calculation:

Assuming 15% of confirmed cases need hospitalisation and 5% ICU admission;

Given 5000 hospital admissions, **expected total cases in VIC (3 month period) = 33,333**

Given 2000 ICU admissions, **expected total cases in VIC (3 month period) = 40,000**
++++++++++
 CASES VS TESTS I’m seeing a lot of we’re “flattening the curve” but I’ve also heard/read a lot of reports that our tests have dropped per day. 

Someone posted on here not too long ago a table which clearly stipulated the percent of new cases and percent of tests conducted on each given day and I was hoping to get a link to that. 

It was useful to see comparatively

Notes: doubling time in days have been smoothed with 7 days (geometric) moving average



The number of cases in Australia was obtained from this wikipedia page

[

the growth and doubling time was calculated. Growth is easy to calculate, just dividing today's number with yesterday's number. Doubling time was calculated by taking the geometric seven day moving average of growth and then converting the result to doubling time.

Example: doubling time for 2020-03-10 is

log(2) / ( (log(1.16) + log(1.1) + log(1.15) + log(1.22) + log(1.13) + log(1.23) + log(1.27))/7 ) = 4.2169
