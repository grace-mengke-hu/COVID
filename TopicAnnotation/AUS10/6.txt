 Can we extend the testing criteria in Victoria? Not enough people are getting tested in Victoria, and we have the capacity to do much more tests. We're doing less than 15 000 tests a day, but we could easily do at least twice this number. Dan is asking for more people to get tested in every single of his press conference, but it doesn't seem to work as the test numbers are staying low.

&amp;#x200B;

Can we do routine testing, like we use to do with the doorknockers 1 month ago? 

I have a worker permit, and I'm in contact with 100s of people every day. I think I should be able to get tested even if I don't show any symptoms.

So can we extend the testing criteria? For example anyone with a worker permit can get tested, even without symptoms.

It would raise the testing numbers and help to prevent new outbreaks.

 Daily Tests/Positive Ratio 17th Sept Daily 0.2% positivity ratio, 28 cases on 14247 Test results  
14 Day Avg: 0.36%, 51 Cases, 14562 Tests

&amp;#x200B;



Note: I do this on the actual new cases / the number of reported tests. Some other places do it on the 'net new' cases. I prefer this way, as this is the daily snapshot - The *actual* number of positives from the previous 24 hours vs the *actual* number of tests processed. Reclassified numbers could have been from any time. This way will give slightly higher ratios, and is pessimistic about the 14d average. These are the state wide gross numbers - DHHS seem to be a bit of a black box in how they get their averages. It's important you, the reader, understand what the difference is. A positivity ratio of 1% does not imply that 1% of the wider population is infected - the tests are not of a random sample of the population.

 France introduces curfew to control Covid. Does this validate Melbournes strategy? With France set to enact an “after dark” type curfew - does this validate the decision for Melbourne to use the same strategy which was heavily criticised.

I approach this from the idea of purely trying to reduce the number of mystery cases, as well as the overall number of cases.

Andrews was heavily criticised for his curfew approach - forcing a lawsuit from his opponents - but has France (and possibly UK soon) used our data from our strategies to implement a similar approach?

 What has happened to those were tested positive? Has anyone who was tested positive come forward on any platform explaining their symptoms, what it was like after being diagnosed or even how they are after?

I can't seem to find any information in regards to those who were tested postive, who have been discharged or anyone who is still currently in isolation.
