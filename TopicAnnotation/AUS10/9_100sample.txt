 QLD records 1 new death Another Queenslander has died with COVID-19 taking the state’s toll to seven.

Australia’s death toll now stands at 103.

The 30-year-old central Queensland man died on Tuesday night at Blackwater, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk announced this morning.

She said the man showed symptoms but was not tested until after his death.

Authorities are unsure how the man contracted the coronavirus and the case has been referred to the coroner.

The man is the first Queenslander to die from the virus outside the state’s south-east corner.

Three Brisbane north residents have died with the virus, two on the Darling Downs and one on the Sunshine Coast.

 [NSW] Second quarantine guard to test positive for COVID-19 worked with first guard A second guard at a quarantine hotel in Sydney to test positive to COVID-19 worked on a shift with the first guard, NSW Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant has said.

The man, who tested positive at about midnight last night, was one of 700 people tested after the first guard tested positive.

Dr Chant said the man, who had no symptoms, worked on the same shift with the other guard on August 3, but there was currently not an "immediate connection" between them.

The second guard then worked at the Sheraton Grand Hyde Park overnight on August 16, but it was not clear if he was infectious at that time.

All 699 other people who were tested after the first guard's case came back negative.

Urgent testing will be carried out this weekend to determine if the second quarantine hotel security guard to test positive for COVID-19 in Sydney has the same virus strain as the first.

NSW Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant said in a media conference on Saturday afternoon that the second guard and four close contacts are currently being managed in a health facility.

Dr Chant said although the second guard worked on the same shift as the first on August 3, at Sydney Harbour Marriott Hotel, the urgent genome sequencing would be completed by Monday "for the ultimate investigative thoroughness".

"It's critical that we don’t jump to conclusions," Dr Chant said.

She said the second guard's viral load was "quite low" so there may be issues with the ability to carry out the sequencing.

Dr Chant said it is "reassuring" that the second guard is the only other case to emerge after 700 people were tested following the first quarantine security guard testing positive.

"This is a very tricky virus," Dr Chant said.

"The first security guard in effect led us to this second security guard. That's the responsibility we all have, is to rock up and get this testing done [when we have any symptoms]."

 In response to WHO declaring a pandemic, the Australian government say they have been treating it like a pandemic "all along".   [ 

Treasurer Josh Frydenberg says government has been treating the coronavirus as a pandemic "all along", adding that Australia has been "ahead of the world".

The World Health Organisation (WHO) overnight declared the global crisis a pandemic, saying it is “deeply concerned” by the alarming levels of spread, severity and inaction.

Mr Frydenberg said this doesn't change much for Australia.

"We have moved ahead of the world in putting in place travel restrictions, and providing the assisted departure from Australians out of China and other places in the world, where they have been impacted by the virus," Mr Frydenberg told ABC just now.

"Yesterday, we announced a substantial package of measures to boost our health preparedness, working with the states. Today, we will announce our fiscal response but we have been treating this like a pandemic for some time."

 Cover your face I have info on the subject of covering your face which you might like to read. Please forward, and start some activism if you can.

&amp;#x200B;

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~    

If you must leave your house then cover your face. Any kind of face covering - a scarf or bandana for instance - will help to reduce transmission rates.   

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~     

Key points:-     

1/ You can be infected without showing: protect others by wearing at least a scarf or bandana.    

2/ Face covering will help stop hand-face transmission.        

3/ Wearing a home-made mask will help normalise the behaviour. The more people that are wearing masks, the lower the transmission rates. In the event you have an n95 mask and fear adverse reaction from fellow commuters, wear a bandana over the top.    

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~     

Science:-    

[

"Conclusions/Significance:-    

Any type of general mask use is likely to decrease viral exposure and infection risk on a population level, in spite of imperfect fit and imperfect adherence"    

&amp;#x200B;

CDC report on emerging infectious diseases:-    

[

"Results of our study have global relevance to respiratory disease control planning \[...\] For new or emerging respiratory virus infections, no pharmaceutical interventions may be available. \[...\] Masks may therefore play an important role in reducing transmission."    

&amp;#x200B;

Surgical ("leaky") masks vs n95 (context - influenza): surprise result - "leaky" masks won:-    

[

&amp;#x200B;

Science has shown we touch our faces 23 times an hour without conscious knowledge:-       

[

&amp;#x200B;

The foregoing is of particular concern as the coronavirus RNA has been found after \*17 days\* on surfaces, making it even more vital that we do everything we can to reduce hand-face transmission:-   

[

[

&amp;#x200B;

\*There will never be a definitive scientific study proving the effectiveness of face covering, or indeed masks generally.\* As pointed out by Dr David Hui a respiratory medicine expert at Chinese University of Hong Kong who studied the 2002-2003 outbreak of SARS, a properly controlled study would be impossible to conduct ethically. “You can’t randomize people to not wear a mask, and some to wear a mask, and then expose them all to the virus.” He points out that it is "common sense" that wearing a mask would assist in protecting against covid-19. [ 

&amp;#x200B;

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~     

Government policy and law:-    

The USA's CDC suggests - as a very last resort - that scarves and bandanas be used by health care workers facing patients known to be infected with covid-19. If it is an appropriate recommendation for health care workers facing known live cases, then it is appropriate that everyone now wear a scarf or bandana when they must be in public.    

[

&amp;#x200B;

The Czech Republic as of 19th March made it a legal requirement to wear a face covering that covers nose and mouth when in public:-    

[

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~   

Activism:-    

1/ Organise your colleagues and demand that your employer implement policy making face covering in the workplace mandatory.           

2/ Petition your local and state governments to make face covering in public and and the workplace a legal requirement.    

Success story: from the Czech Republic:

 'No other option': ICU staff forced to make own PPE with stationery **Source**: 

---

Personal protective equipment is so low in one intensive care unit at a Sydney hospital that for several weeks doctors and nurses have been forced to make their own protective face shields out of stationery supplies.

[DIY face shields: Westmead ICU staff shared instructions with other hospitals.](

“I am sure they don’t meet infection control standards but we have no other option,” said a member of the intensive care unit (ICU) at Sutherland Hospital.

On Tuesday, after reading an article in The Sydney Morning Herald about ICU workers at St Vincent’s Hospital using the wrong masks, a doctor at Sutherland Hospital realised they too had been using the same mask which is suitable only for dry airborne situations and not for aerosol-generating procedures associated with the care of patients being ventilated.

After raising the issue of the model P2 8210 masks with the infection control team, they were told they were at “low risk” and the masks were fine. But later that same day the P2 model 8210 masks were replaced with the P2 (model N95) recommended for healthcare workers performing aerosol-generating procedures, "including intubation, bronchial suctioning and prolonged contact with critically ill patients".

Sutherland Hospital’s ICU members were assured by the NSW Health Department that there was only a low risk of infection because they were wearing face shields.

It was then pointed out no face shields had been available for weeks, which had left staff to make their own.

“We’ve had to make our own face shields out of binder covers, stationery basically,” the health worker said. "We don’t know if they meet the standards or not. So how can you say the risk is low?"

Instructions on how to construct these masks were provided by colleagues in the ICU at Westmead Hospital, who have been facing similar shortages.

The items required, according to the email from Westmead ICU, are “binding covers (stationery item) 1 sheet per visor,” cotton tape, self-adhesive foam, scissors and staples. The last item on the list is “patience”.

On Friday morning, a day after ordering the removal from use of the model 8210 masks, South Australian Health reversed the decision ruling that the masks, received from the Commonwealth's stockpile of PPE, had been deemed safe.

The Advertiser has reported that Royal Adelaide Hospital’s ICU workers are understood to have been using the masks without face shields.
Up to 50 intensive care doctors and nurses have been wearing homemade face shields made from clear plastic binding covers used in stationery, “sticking some foam to the top of it and using tape to tie it around our heads,” said the staff member.

The ICU staff became further concerned about the adequacy of their personal protective equipment (PPE) after being alerted that they were using the wrong masks while treating critically ill COVID-19 patients.

An ICU nurse in her early 20s, who was wearing the recommended PPE, has tested positive for COVID-19. According to SA Health, she is now in isolation as are 22 of her colleagues from RAH.

Comment about the adequacy of Sutherland Hospital’s PPE was sought from the South Eastern Sydney Local Health District.

 It’s just the flu, brah. I hope when this is all said and done, Australians take stock of how and why we were exposed to this crisis. 

It’s not the Chinese or the Italians or the Iranians we should be looking at. But in our own back yard. Decades of weak and corrupt political leaders have put us at risk. 

We are a continent of almost unlimited resources. Until recently we were the most affluent (on paper at least). We are a net exporter of food. We are one of the most technically advanced countries in the world. We have the intelligence, resources and ability to control the spread of this virus, care for our sick, and wait out all the supply issues while the rest of the world implodes. 

And yet, here we are. We can’t protect our first responders because we can’t manufacture masks. Our hospitals will buckle under the weight of our sick because we’ve spent decades trying to force people into an American style private health system while neglecting the staff and resourcing of our public system. 

We can’t even be adults and warn the public without freaking everyone out. We spent the months since the start of the crisis in China telling everyone not to worry - it’s just the flu bro. This was so pervasive that even some of our healthcare professionals are paying off the threat. And now we shame the people who, perhaps misguided, rushed out to protect their families when the collective realisation set in. That we don’t make anything in this country. Our medications, our antibiotics, anything not grown in the ground (except TP) is shipped in from China. 

We all know this. We ship wool to China, they ship cheap T-Shirts to us. We ship coal and iron ore to China, they ship cheap steal to us. We import most of our oil. We can barely keep electricity affordable despite having some of the largest gas and coal reserves in the world. Our political leaders, from Keating, to Howard, to Rudd/Gillard/Rudd/Abbot/Turnbull/Scotty from marketing. All they have achieved is the dismantling of Australian sovereignty. They have exported our security and turned us into a tributary state. People will die, not just from the virus, but from all the secondary complications caused by supply issues and overloaded hospitals. It is these people, their corporate overlords, and their media mates, who have traded the wealth of this country for beans. 

They will not be affected by this. Their families are protected. Yours are not.

“I got angry looking for masks, they’re either all sold out, or the  masks that are from overseas are sold at an inflated price,” Tang said,  wearing a mask, at the factory set up close to the border with the  mainland.  

“So I thought, making a mask isn’t that hard, just some fabric sewn together, how about I make my own factory?” 

Tang  and his financial backers paid $150,000 to import a machine from a  factory near Chennai, in India. It makes 100,000 masks per day, and Tan  hopes to have eight machines running by April. 

The masks made in the citizen’s group will be sold exclusively online for HK$1 (13 U.S. cents) a piece.

 Speaking of a hypothetical vaccine. Best case scenario. Science makes a break through. We have a successful vaccine. The biggest issue I see after that is the mass quantity and distribution required to heal all those infected countries. It’s nice to hold on to hope. But it’s also important to be realistic. The whole world can’t just be cured in one week. We’re talking mass production on an epic scale that could take months, maybe even years. Not to mention all the countries that would have to vie for it to be made available legally. The annoying red tape that gets in the way of common human decency. Because that’s the world we live in. And then we have those annoying anti-vaxers who would probably get sick and the refuse to take it, still spreading the virus.

So we would still have a long way to go.

 Emergency ventilators I posted this to a comment on China\_Flu but was hoping I might get help here.

My colleagues and I are trying to work on a solution that can be manufactured and used anywhere. Iron lungs were mass produced during the polio epidemic, it's old (150 years: google spirophore) technology but the principles are sound. Advantage of not needing medications, or necessarily even trained medical people to use it.

It's not helpful in someone critically ill without supplemental oxygen, and I wouldn't presume it replaces a PPV ventilator, but it may buy some time for patients who would otherwise die, think someone in a regional town awaiting retrieval.  


We are trying to (re)create a cuirass ventilator. It uses a rigid cuirass shell around the thorax which expands the chest using negative pressure.

The trick is designing it so it can be mass produced by anyone, anywhere. We are experimenting using a vacuum cleaner to create the negative pressure. The main problem is controlling the cycling. Ideally it would have positive pressure on expiration, but this is much more difficult.

If anyone reads this and can advise/help it would be much appreciated. I can manage the medical side, but am not an engineer.

We were looking to make this work locally, but no reason it can't be national.

 PM: Australia secures a further 50 million doses of covid-19 vaccine *MEDIA RELEASE*  
*05 Nov 2020*  
*Prime Minister, Minister for Health-*  
\--  
Two more COVID-19 vaccines have been secured for the Australian population under new agreements, bringing the Australian Government’s COVID-19 vaccine investment to more than $3.2 billion.

Under the agreements, Novavax will supply 40 million vaccine doses and Pfizer/BioNTech will provide 10 million vaccine doses, should the vaccines be proven safe and effective.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the Government’s COVID-19 Vaccine and Treatment Strategy had now secured access to four COVID-19 vaccines and over 134 million doses.

“By securing multiple COVID-19 vaccines we are giving Australians the best shot at early access to a vaccine, should trials prove successful,” the Prime Minister said.

“We aren’t putting all our eggs in one basket and we will continue to pursue further vaccines should our medical experts recommend them.

“There are no guarantees that these vaccines will prove successful, however our Strategy puts Australia at the front of the queue, if our medical experts give the vaccines the green light.”

The Novavax and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines are expected to be available in Australia from early to mid 2021 – subject to approval by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) for use in Australia.

The Pfizer/BioNTech is a messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) type vaccine and the Novavax vaccine is a protein vaccine containing an adjuvant (Matrix-M) which enhances the immune response.

Health Minister Greg Hunt said Australia’s COVID-19 vaccine portfolio now had two protein vaccines and one mRNA and one viral vector type vaccine, strengthening Australia’s position to access safe and effective vaccines as soon as available.

“The goal and the expectation is that Australians who sought vaccination will be vaccinated within 2021,” Minister Hunt said.

“There are no surprises, health and aged care workers and the elderly and vulnerable will be the first to gain access to a vaccine that’s deemed safe and effective.”

These new agreements build on the Australian Government’s existing commitments to purchase the University of Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine and a local candidate from the University of Queensland together with Australian manufacturer CSL Limited (Seqirus).

Subject to the vaccine being registered by the TGA as safe and effective, preliminary advice from the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation is that the priority groups for the COVID-19 vaccine are those people who are at increased risk of exposure, such as health and aged care workers, the elderly and those working in services critical to societal functioning.

The Australian Government is currently consulting with the states and territories, key medical experts and industry peak bodies on the framework for the initial roll-out of the COVID-19 vaccination program in early 2021.

Key vaccination sites will initially include GPs, GP respiratory clinics, state and territory vaccination sites and workplaces such as aged care facilities.

Australia has a world class vaccination program with world leading vaccination rates. The COVID-19 vaccine will not be mandatory and individuals will maintain the option to choose not to vaccinate. The vaccine will be available for free to those who choose to be vaccinated.

This commitment forms a crucial part of the Australian Government’s response to COVID-19 and the strategy to protect the health and wellbeing of Australians and the national economy.

Internationally, Australia has also joined the COVAX facility, which will provide access to a large portfolio of COVID-19 candidates and manufactures around the world for up to 50 per cent of the Australian population.

The Australian Government has also committed to support access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines for the Pacific and Southeast Asia, as part of a shared recovery for our region from the pandemic, as well as $80 million to the international COVAX Facility for the benefit of high-risk populations in developing countries.

Our agreements allow Australia to donate to partners in the Pacific and Southeast Asia, should these vaccines prove safe and effective, and units are available above domestic needs.

The Government is contributing significantly to vaccine research and development both in Australia and around the world, investing $363 million in vaccines, therapeutics and COVID medicines - including $257 million in vaccines.

The roll-out of a potential COVID-19 vaccine is a significant logistical challenge, suppliers that have a proven track record in vaccine logistics and distribution or booking systems, tracking and reporting of vaccines are being invited to participate in a limited tender process.

As part of our COVID-19 vaccines strategy and broader vaccines strategy, the Australian Government is considering an amendment to the *Australian Immunisation Register Act* *2015* to mandate reporting of all vaccinations to the Register.

 Successful vaccines will take longer to test than failed vaccines So while vaccine trials are being conducted they will be tallying the number of infected within the trial up and when they think there is enough statistical power to unblind the trial they will unblind.

The thing about this process is an ineffective vaccine will have more infected as both the treatment and control groups will be getting infected. So ineffective trials will be ready to unblind and release failures well before successful vaccines. The most effective trials will take the longest time as only half their study group are exposed.

Be prepared to have a number of failures announced before a successful candidate comes forward. It won't be because a vaccine is impossible, it will just be selection bias. But be prepared for a wave of doom and gloom.

NSW Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant has warned up to 1.6 million people in the state are ­likely to ­become infected.

But Australia currently has just 2229 ICU beds.

She said forecasts showed five per cent of residents affected by coronavirus – or up to 80,000 people – would require intensive care.

However, NSW has just 874 beds.

Statistician Megan Higgie, from James Cook University, estimates that when Australia has 44,580 infected patients, our ICU beds will be full, assuming they will all be taken up by coronavirus patients.

She believes that will mean we could run out of ICU beds in early April.

But because not all beds will be taken up by coronavirus – with people from car accidents and heart attacks still needing them – she said the date would be even sooner.

 Neglect of Prisoners During Coronavirus Pandemic Threatens to Further Escalate the Current Crisis &amp;#x200B;

[ Prisoners on the roof of the San Vittore Prison in Milan, at the heart of the outbreak in Italy.  ](

The U.S. has one of the largest prison populations in the world, topping the list both [in absolute numbers]( and [in per-capita terms]( Most prisoners in the United States are imprisoned because they [can’t afford bail]( [for minor offenses]( or because of [deliberate targeting by racist police and government policies]( During the Coronavirus pandemic, prisoner neglect has been highlighted and state and county governments are being pressured to release some of those incarcerated to avoid spreading the coronavirus. Releasing prisoners is a basic step that should be taken to reduce prisoners’ exposure to the virus, but it’s only one among a large number of steps the U.S. government would need to take if it were serious about defeating the virus. However, given the brutal way that the U.S. government treats prisoners, any steps the government does take are not going to be done out of kindness and generosity but as a result of prisoners organizing and demanding basic changes.

Throughout the many jails and prisons across the country, conditions before the coronavirus outbreak were already dismal. [Many live in cold, overcrowded cells with rodent infestations]( [Many sinks for handwashing don’t work and prisoners have no access to soap or paper towels]( As such, they are forced to buy cleaning products at private- and state-run commissaries at inflated prices.

Recently, New York Governor Cuomo was [criticized for announcing that New York State would be producing 100,000 gallons of hand sanitizer without mentioning that prison labor]( would be used to produce it. The hand sanitizer is being produced by Corcraft, a “brand name” for [New York State’s prison-labor program]( Corcraft paid prisoners an average of [about $0.65/hour in 2015-2016]( These wages are typical in prisons, [yet the copay for prison health care services can cost at least a month of such pathetic wages](

What’s more, prisons often deny or delay basic medical care and have notoriously terrible health care services for those who do get care. [A 2019 CNN Investigation]( revealed that medical units at prisons are vastly understaffed and the staff that are there tend to be poorly trained. Many medical requests by prisoners go unanswered, causing preventable deaths. In light of the coronavirus, this reality is especially concerning. [Half of prisoners have at least one chronic illness.]( A coronavirus outbreak in prisons will necessitate mass transfers to already overwhelmed local hospitals. It is a real possibility that infected prisoners will be left to die.

Already Rikers Island, the second largest jail system in the country and New York City’s main jail, [announced that 21 prisoners, 12 jail employees, and five correctional health workers have the virus]( Employees at a prison in [Washington State, in Indiana,]( and at [another New York prison]( have also tested positive.

Prisoners around the world have already begun to rebel against these oppressive conditions during the pandemic. The Italian government [cancelled visitation rights]( for prisoners as part of its nation-wide lockdown. Testing for the virus throughout overcrowded prisons in Italy has also been limited at best. In response to the current crisis and long-standing poor conditions in prisons, [prisoners at around 30 facilities across Italy protested]( 12 prisoners died and around 50 escaped as the police attempted to quell the rebellion.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Protesting prisoners unfold a banner saying “pardon” in Italian on the roof of the San Vittore prison. ](

Similar protests could break out in prisons across the U.S., which last occurred in 1995. [In October 1995, prisoners closely followed a legislative proposal to reduce crack cocaine sentencing, which by design was 100 times longer than the corresponding powder cocaine offense to target poor black Americans.]( When a Congress full of racists failed to pass the law, protests erupted in prisons across the country. While the crack cocaine sentencing catalyzed the protests, prisoners also rebelled because of guard brutality, poor conditions, and overcrowding.

Given that the virus is making its way throughout cramped prisons, some states and countries have decided to release prisoners. Iran, for example, temporarily [released 85,000 prisoners as it struggles with one of the world’s worst outbreaks of coronavirus]( The Los Angeles County sheriff announced on March 16th that the prisoner population was [reduced by more than 600 and that arrests per day decreased from about 300 to 60]( In Ohio, [38 prisoners were released after appearing in court for low-level, non-violent offenses.](

However, the decision to release people will come with consequences for the ruling elite. Given the current economic crisis, releasing prisoners will add to an already growing unemployed population. [According to U.S. government plans, the coronavirus pandemic could last 18 months and will likely result in widespread shortages of food and medical supplies]( Former prisoners will undoubtedly be furious when they realize that the situation outside of prison is also grim.

Outside of prison, the coronavirus crisis is highlighting the incompetence and instability of the capitalist state and serves as an opportunity for the people to create seismic changes to society. The same goes for prisons, where the day to day injustices can be fiercely challenged and changed. Whether states and counties decide to free prisoners or not, we should expect that prisoners will take a heavy toll during this pandemic. They will be on the frontline in the fight against the state’s repressive apparatus during the accelerating medical and socio-economic crises.

 How is this pandemic different to the Swine Flu pandemic in 2009? This is a genuine question, I was 16 and attending high school in the Sydney CBD during the Swine Flu pandemic in 2009 during which Australia had nearly 40,000 cases. 
I don’t remember the response to that pandemic being anything like this one. It may be because I was a self centred teenager at the time but can anyone point out to me what makes the two so vastly different?
