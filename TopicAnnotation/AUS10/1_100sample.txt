 I know everyone is scared about food but we have a chance to stop this today. It won't be there by Friday. Singapore acted as strongly as anyone in the world as before they had 100 cases. They were actually testing rigorously before 100 as well so their data was accurate. We are turning away people for testing by the thousands and nothing is closed yet. We have a choice today on if we end up like Singapore, South Korea and Hong Kong or if we continue down the Italy, UK and United States path. Please ask your managers and politicians to take decisive action or we will end up with a nationwide infection.

 The government is failing Victorians. Should the Victorians take matters into their own hands and fight this virus the right way, regardless of economic consequences? Please read, share your thoughts. The government is gradually letting the virus loose in the community, whether on purpose or not.

They are putting in less than ideal restrictions at far too late of a timing.

The governments plan is "suppression" - as to not eliminate the virus completely because of the poor economic outcomes. Essentially trading lives for money.

Maybe it is time for an organised and professional revolt. Take control of the situation and close our businesses, and keep people at home for a period of time. Encouraging a stage 4 type restriction state wide, at our own will.

We could create a catchy slogan, a website and viral posts, groups on social media, put flyers up in all towns, appoint a leader for every shire council and hold regular zoom meetings, etc. All with the goal of doing the right thing and saving lives while eliminating the virus.

I'm sure people would be very interested. We would need creative graphic designers to create informative, catchy slogans and media to post everywhere. Maybe a skilled social media campaign organisers to make sure the message gets across. 

If enough people get on board, we could enforce our own "lockdown" and do it the right way. There would be economic consequences but, really, aren't people worth keeping alive?

I'm picturing a huge movement with a catchy slogan and strong branding, led by everyday people, for the best interest of the everyday people. Something that will be recorded in the history books as an example of an effective civillian led peaceful movement.

 I am confused, to isolate or not to isolate? I have been trying to do the right thing here but i am finding it is a nightmare to find out what the right thing to do is.

Multiple people at my partners work were tested positive, they shut his work down until the end of the month.

At the time we found out, we both had cold symptoms so tested last Tuesday. 
The person testing said isolate until we get our results.
Received results Friday and all our symptoms were also gone so we thought we could go out and get food.

Questions
- Are we supposed to stay home for 2 weeks?
- Do I need to stay home for 2 weeks too? 
- Do we both need to get tested again? 
- Am I allowed to go out and get food but not him? 

It’s really not clear and I can totally understand why people are leaving their houses.

 Is there actually any plan, from here on? I was reading some slightly rabid threads in the global CV sub and it got me thinking/agreeing with some of them. At first the lockdown/shutdown was to buy time, flatten the curve, so hospitals can prepare/expand, and not get overwhelmed etc, until a vaccine or herd immunity develops. Instead, we have quietly forgotten that 'until' part or assumed it won't be 18 months away in either case, and now it's just... 'destroy' the curve to "zero" and then what? 1 person who still has it may just start the whole thing again, so are we then all locked back inside for an extra month? And then we let a few tourists in, bam, they don't tell anyone they were sick because they didn't want to go into a hotel for 14 days, here we go again..

I know that government app came out but the government doesn't have enough trust/goodwill to see enough people using it after their various other privacy and IT debacles, nor is it going to be much use with a 2 week incubation period unless I'm missing something there.

I think we need to now look at other options such as allowing people to take their own risks (companies reopening etc) and the elderly/sick being the ones isolated for their own protection (which they would have to regardless - you already can't /shouldn't be visiting them). This doesn't guarantee that no one healthy will die, but there also comes a point where the damage to society becomes worse from the social destruction than if people were getting sick.

I have only left the house a few times this week, to go running in the park at what I thought would be off-peak times, and to shop at Coles. Both places have been absolutely packed like festival / Christmas season. I don't think I was more than 2 metres from someon else in Coles at any time, there just wasn't the space in the crowds to keep any distance. People are either completely over it, complacent, or simply accepting of the risks even at this somewhat early stage - so there is only so much effect the lockdown rules are even going to have from now on, without any clear and defined end point or outcome in sight. Time to shift gears?

Thoughts?

 Have to go to centrelink office to claim Newstart So I have just lost my job for now as my place of work has shut down due to the virus. I went online to claim Newstart allowance.

 Other people are just going about business as usual while I'm wiping down my groceries after I get back from the supermarket &amp; pulled my kids out of school. Who is the crazy one them or me? I keep reading how bad things are goin to get in Australia - health systems collapse, ICU's overwhelmed, a lot of people dying.

Yet most people I know are acting like this virus isn't a big deal. People were out at cafes this morning packed in. No one is doing social distancing where I live (Bayside Melbourne). 

Am I missing something? Does our low population density and now closed borders mean that we won't experience what is happening in Europe?

How would we even know what true community transmission is going on? For all I know no one in my entire suburb is infected. 

I feel like I'm going a bit crazy and living an alternate reality to everyone else. Does anyone else feel like this? There's a lack of transparency from government and it's really hard to get a handle on the true situation.

 Can someone explain how NSW just had a major drop in Active Cases Was just looking at the Covidlive site, checking on the active cases for my state and was shocked to find that there where massive drops over the past 2 days.


For example, on the Wednesday active cases in the state were at 332, then dropped to 225 on Thursday and are now down to 71 cases today. 


How is it possible that 260+ were deemed COVID free practically overnight?


Has COVID Live changed the way it records active cases?

 How strict are police with enforcing the 5KM? Hi all,
Hope everyone is doing well, just a question that is on my mind, and would love if someone could clarify if I would get fined:

So my best friend and I live in different suburbs, but can meet at an outdoor area which is very spacious which is within 5km for him, about like 100-400m just outside for me. I was just wondering if we could see each other to talk, since I have always dealt with mental health, and they were one of the reasons why I 180’d my life.

I don’t have any intentions of breaking rules, so any clarification of how severe the enforcement is, will be appreciated.

 Any 3D modellers or anyone with access to a 3D printer on here? There are open source projects underway to design medical PPE that is easy to manufacture or to 3D print, I think we need to start discussing what we can do about this. A comment from u/[whippinfresh]( prompted me to make this post.

I'm by no means a professional modeller or a 3D printer, I just study 3D modelling on the side, but I work as a casual orderly/cleaner at Flinders Medical Centre, and there is a pretty big chance that we will eventually run out of **accessible** Personal Protective Equipment where it is needed most.

With that said, I wanted to start a discussion on how we can start locally producing protective equipment at a low cost.  
In Northern Italy, a hospital in Brescia was running out of replacement valves for ventilator masks, which were being burned through by medical staff to stabilize the breathing of coronavirus patients being triaged. Their supplier had run out of stock, and a local 3D printing group had stepped up to make the quick resupply of the valves a reality.

[

There are open source projects such as Project Open Air that are currently collaborating to create and reproduce medical equipment that can be easily and cheaply assembled locally worldwide.

[

During a regular day at Flinders on just one ward, we go through near a dozen boxes of gloves, masks, gowns and faceplates on a daily basis. With the rate the coronavirus is hitting our hospitals and with the rate that cases are being documented at, we don't want to be in the situation Italy's hospitals are currently in.

There's a couple of other open projects being run at the moment to develop and produce cheap and effective ventilator masks that hospitals can use to keep patients stable as well.

Open Lung is a Github-based project to develop a cheap emergency respirator that can be quickly made in the event that normal hospital supply chains are too slow to restock protective equipment.

[

I think that with the community we have across Australia's social media, we can quickly get something started that can ensure at the very least that shortages of vital equipment at our hospitals won't last for very long. When I go back to work for my call-in shifts during the week, I'll be asking the nursing staff about what PPE they are likely to start running out of.

It's small and I feel it won't end up impacting much, but getting the ball rolling is better than keeping it still.

 My company is still making everyone come in and not follow social distancing properly Need some advice.

My company puts in email to "work from home when you can. However this will depend on your line manager."

My line manager gives me a look when anyone from our team suggests working from home and expencts us to then come in the next day after working from home. (E.g. work from home on monday, must come in on tuesday)

I'm genuinely worried about my safety and don't know what to do. I'm so low down the chain that if i voiced my opinion to anyone i don't think anyone would listen. Considering that 2 people from my company and one of them from my level were confirmed cases, it feels bothersome that they's still expect us to come into the office and work.

They're reason is literally "it's just business as usual, nothing to be too alarmed about. The government hasn't announces a full lockdown and until they do we'll continue to work."

I can't just quit considering the economy and expenses i need to pay. I feel like this is completely unfair and they don't seem to care whether the other employees get the virus or not at this point in time.

I don't know what to do at this point and it's killing me to know i'm pretty much helpless in this.

For all others, please stay safe.

 I’m still going to the gym, are these measures enough? Any suggestions? I know that blanket articles say that a lot of people caught the virus at the gym, but please hear me out and give me your thoughts. 

I am not sure how much longer I will go daily but I don’t like missing the gym. Some people see it as non-essential, but it’s important to my mental health and has been for a long time. I also feel like exercise is the best preparation I can do if I do get the virus. 

I plan to start exercising at home for the body parts that I can substitute equipment with, but I’m finding it hard to substitute leg and back workouts, which make up 3 or 4 days a week.

I live in a very residential part of Sydney that has had no cases. I drive to the gym. I went a few days ago during non-peak hours (I can WFH), and it was empty - so the social distancing side was satisfied. I’m going to continue to make sure that this is the case (or only 2 or 3 people I can stay far away from) before I train.

As for the existing virus and germs, I was able to use the antibacterial wipes supplied (and bring my own), and wipe down the weights, and then hold wipes as a barrier when gripping weights. I’m hyper-conscious and disciplined about not touching my face now, so even if my hands are contaminated, it shouldn’t be an issue. After each exercise, I’ll go to the bathroom and wash my hands for 20 seconds before moving to the next exercise. None of my exercises require me to have my face against a bench.

I keep my phone on the floor and treat that as contaminated. At the end of the workout, I will sanitise it with wipes and rubbing alcohol. I will then go to the lockers, put all my gym clothes into a plastic bag, wash my hands again, and then have a shower. Wash hands again once I get home. Gym clothes then immediately go into the laundry bin once I get home. Wash hands again.

Is this enough to minimise my exposure? Is there more I could be doing? Outside of the gym, I’m self-isolating, so I hope I wouldn’t be bringing in germs with me.

Then my mind went to there is such a small % of our population that has been knowingly exposed, I wonder how we will ever open the international gates while the infection and transmission globally is so high, I feel like one of those remote tribes where people get outsiders to stay away so they don’t get exposed. When the day comes when our boarder opens again how our govt will handle it. Will we be one of those countries that avoids now and then has the catastrophic health impacts later.....

 Sorry Dan Andrews, Decision Theory says you should go back to work after Covid-19 test but before getting your results back. It is called decision theory. Look it up.

[

[Read about how to do Decision Theory](

Imagine if you are a poor working fella earning $25 per hour and casual with no sick leave.

You  take a covid-19 test and you have 99% of getting a negative result and a  1% chance of getting a positive result. You only get the government $1500 if you test **POSITIVE**.

If you stay at home and not work, then 99% of the time you get $0 and 1% of the time you get $1500 from the government.

If you work, you get $25 \* 8 hours \* 3 days (from work) until you get the result back. And the result is almost always **NEGATIVE**.

So what would you do? Oh yes, you still need to pay the rent and NOT PISSED OFF your **BOSS** with a **NEGATIVE** Covid-19 result..

If the government are being this blasé in terms of the next step, what’s going to happen when small retail is forced to shutter its doors due to lack of healthy employees? Or worse yet, the country’s small businesses are sunk financially due to an either officially or unofficially imposed quarantine? Can’t pay bills if you’re not making money.

 Is there a financial plan in place when we lock down?  With an entire shutdown looming and nearly (if not more than) 1/3rd of the country on casual employment with many of those in Hospitality and Retail (the directly effected)

My partner and I are both in the hospo industry on a casual employment basis and live week to week. We have to rent as we can't afford mortgage. So if pubs, restaurants etc are forced to close doors..we're financially ruined and lose everything. And I'm sure we're not alone in this. I'm out of touch with the current measures being put in place by the government to assure stability (if any) so I'm just making this post to find out..what do we do? What happens from here?

Surely our government can't condemn hundreds of thousands of us to financial ruin?

I was under the assumption that if a crisis like this ever came across us that the government would push banks to be a little more lenient with mortgage payments and so fourth which would trickle down to renters and small businesses paying leases on buildings. I also figured they'd scrap/lower late fee's and add grace periods for those who are late for any bill payment.  


Directing all of us to Centrelinks dole payment is a recipe for disaster as the entire system is already under heavy duress. Which can and more than likely will leave thousands of Australians without payment on time or at all.

 Hints for when out and shopping Just looking for additional ideas. Having a one-sided conversation with partner about precautions when shopping. His idea of protecting himself is laughable. 

So, obvs observe distance. Possibly wear a plastic glove for picking up things. Pay with card rather than cash. Sanitize trolley or basket before use. Dispose of glove responsibly. Sanitize hands when finished. Return home and wash hands for good measure. Do we really need to wash groceries yet? (And how would you wash kitty litter?! Or do we need to quarantine it in the garage for 9 days...)

Any other ideas? When is good to start wearing a homemade mask? (Which I have still to make...)

 Schools Just curious how exams and assessments would work if schools were to be shit within the next week. Most of the test are done on paper under close supervision so without that would they be put off or done at home in some way?

 Idiots have ruined a big part of this year and we need to start fining people I don’t care if some people will get mad at Scomo because everyone already is. Because people have been ignoring medical advice and going to beaches, churches, bars, parties and literally anywhere they don’t need to be:
1) Easter has been ruined for people who celebrate it (for my family it’s almost like another Christmas because my nanna is from the authodox church)
2) More people have died and will die. The death rate for children with COVID19 is 6% and the overall death rate is 2%.
3) My great great auntie cannot visit us this year because of the health risk
4) My brother cannot use school equipment (they had a rule where you couldn’t bring your own as to prevent theft) and they STILL let him share his own. He is no longer attending school.
5) Sick people were not sent home from my school. I am now staying home as I am high risk, however would even if I weren’t.

This would’ve been manageable and dealt with if people stayed home, our schools were closed sooner and legal action was taken. It’s not “living your life”, it’s taking life away.

 Current testing turnaround times Victoria. I searched the sub and the last post relating to this was around 2 weeks ago and there seemed to be quite a mixed response in terms of testing turnaround times. 

Just got tested at Footscray bunnings and they said 3-5 days for results, had a work colleague test around 2 weeks ago and took around 36 hours to get a negative text back. My mum got tested on a friday at a UFS clinic in regional Vic and got her negative result back mid monday.

Anyone been tested recently and can weigh in with their turnaround times?

 Shut the schools! As a special needs educator I can't tell you how stressed and anxious we all are when we go to work. Our students have no sense of hygiene and we don't have enough soap to go around the school. We are spat on, deliver personal care multiple times a day, parents are allowed to walk around the school and into our classrooms freely yet we've been told we're "overreacting". We have sick staff members who are continuing to come to work as they don't have any sick leave left and are unable to get by using unpaid leave as we've been instructed. We have a right to be scared and sending us an email once a week saying thanks for the hard work isn't making us feel anything but angry and unappreciated. Parents have told us they aren't worried about the virus but just don't want to be stuck at home with their children for 14 days. WE ARE NOT BABYSITTERS. Please keep your children home!

 Is there any hope of my fiancee being granted entry into Australia? We aren't married, and so she doesn't fall under the category if being my immediate family. The relationship is real, and genuine, and we've been engaged for 16 months. I've met her in real life, so it's not just an online thing.

Has anybody successfully managed to get their partner here? We haven't seen each other for 10 months, and if she can't come here in any way, its probably going to be 24 months before I see her again. Just wondering if we have any option regarding her traveling here, maybe under compassionate grounds?

 How long will it take to produce and distribute vaccine. Lets assume a Vaccine is approved etc in December and then production starts 1st January 2021. (Muprhy said it takes a few weeks between approval and production starting.)

I am hearing that it is estimated each person needs 2 doses probably for herd immunity so let's say 50 million doses. How long do you think it will take to produce it and then distribute it to an extent where we can let people in and ease restrictions?

We are lucky to have CSL and Sequel as Aus owned companies with Aussie assets which should speed it up for us quite a bit. I have heard people say anywhere from two months to two years lol.

 Advice regarding what Doctor said My mother apparently saw her doctor today and he said that he thinks 90 percent of people have had the virus already or currently have it. It might be deep in our lungs or our bodies may have gotten rid of it and that's why it's not showing up in tests. Then she said to me "why should I socially distance myself and isolate if we all have it already?". She has diabetes and heart failure and is in her 70's so I am pissed off. Has anyone else heard of this theory? Could it possibly be true? I feel like ringing medical centre and asking if he has been telling patients that.

 Switching from 1 hour of the news to an expert panel from Uni of Melb on CoVid! link here: 

Univeristy of Melbourne have published a Q and A style talk with infectious disease experts, vaccine experts, a top psychologist etc. to discuss the current crisis. 

It isn’t sensationalism or eye grabbing news headlines, but I feel it is a very informative and pragmatic discussion that provides the public with imformation of where the science is at as of 21 March.

I’d recommend changing 50 minutes of news headlines to watch this and keen to hear others views?

I’m particularly fond of the control discussion and how individuals can consider what is currently in their control and what isn’t, as a way of focusing on behaviour change.

Hopefully someone else finds it interesting!

 People still aren't washing their fucking hands! So. I am a self confessed germaphobe. I have always maintained good personal hygiene and at the same time have had a fear of public bathrooms, more particularly taking a dump in those filthy Petri dishes.  

With everything that's happening, one of the simplest ways of furthering this pandemic is washing your fucking hands properly... common fucking sense, right? 

I recently got a job within a shopping centre and therefore have to use these ass-troughs more regularly than I have ever used them and have noticed the lack of hygiene displayed by a large portion of the male, allegedly, homosapien species. From things like not feeling the need to wash their hands at all after taking a piss or people washing their hands for only a few seconds, without soap, after taking a shit. All of this, in spite of having posters plastered all over the walls, in the toilets, telling you step by step instructions on how to wash your grubby paws!

I think these people should be named, shamed and punished. A good start would be a scarlet letter around their necks and when that fails, amputation of the infected limbs would not go astray.

 Shout out to all Melbourne millennials from a Melbourne Boomer. Just a thank you from a boomer to all the millennials and post-millennials reading this. I can remember when I was your age and my mates, sport and chasing girls (or chasing boys: pick one or both) was my life. Now that I am a bit older, with a wife, a few assets and a nice suburban house, with a secure work from home job, I can say that this lock down is not to bad.

But you guys are doing it tough. The other day when walking my dogs I chatted to a young fella and the one thing he desperately wanted to do was play in his suburban soccer team. Talked to a young tradie who was buying a six pack and he mentioned he never buys beer: in normal times he goes to the pub on Friday and Saturday nights with his mates.

The only people I see, or hear about, not wearing masks (apart from the tin hat brigade) are boomers and older. I see videos from America of corona parties and young people being dickheads. I do not see it, nor read about it, in Melbourne.

Now I am sure it is not all peaches and cream and a lot of you are misbehaving under the radar. But it seems to me that that is the exception rather than the rule.

Hang in there you young bastards. The lock down will be over soon. And when we can all go to the pub I will shout you many beers.

Kudos to you guys and girls.

 Options for School Based Chess Coach Hey,

A family member of mine coaches chess is many school in my hometown.  
They are being asked to not come into schools anymore due to COVID19, I imagine this would be the case for a lot of extra curricular based coaches now.  


They want to look at options to do online video based coaching lessons with the children. It must be easily accessible, preferably no bloatware, online (obviously) and relatively easy to use by a non techie person. It would be great if it were an Australian based service, both free and subscription services are an option but would rather there be no cost to the children.   


Would anyone have suggestions for this?

 Travel exemption for studying overseas (AU to UK) Has anyone successfully (or know anyone who has) been able to apply for a travel exemption to study overseas? I'm hoping to start a PhD in the UK in October and do not expect to travel back to Australia for at least 3-4 years (unless travel restrictions ease). I can probably provide evidence of funding, accommodation, enrolment and whatnot, but I can't imagine my circumstances fall under any of the travel exemptions nor under compassionate grounds and based on what I've seen on this sub, "I won't be coming back for a while isn't a good reason..."

 question about my girlfriend travelling to see me this weekend NSW Hello, I am a bit confused about this so called lock down and what it means for my relationship with my girlfriend. We are in NSW, she currently lives 1.5 hour drive away from my place and every weekend we take turns visiting each other. But this weekend being easter has got me concerned because they say police are checking peoples number plates. She is the only person I'm socialising with and the same situation for her. Personally haven't been going outside unless I'm exercising/grocery shopping.

So she will get a massive fine if she attempts to come see me tomorrow? 

(Because I feel like the cops are handing out fines any chance they get, like the person who was washing his car by himself, or the Learner driver in Victoria.)

 Scomo "80% imported or direct contact of imported" Where is his source? Disclosure, I voted Scomo.


The ABC reports circa 150 directly imported cases. 

The sticky tracker on this subreddit says 259 OS travel related cases. Which I guess to mean  contracted overseas or with recent OS travel history but can't confirm exactly where they got the disease.

72 are close contacts of known cases.

Even if you assume close contacts are all with persons of OS travel history, that's still only 50% of all cases. Very far from the 80% figure Scomo quoted today.

 Loophole in JobKeepers scheme I've experienced a pretty dreadful situation with the jobkeepers program and wanted to share. This has resulted in an abuse of the program and no support shown by anyone to the employees. Sorry for length and any errors. Throw away account.

I work as a casual dentist in a privately owned clinic with over 30 staff. We usually have 5 surgeries open, however, due to government regulations and in order to reduce the risk of spread, the practice has only been able to run with 1 dentist working a day. Although auxiliary staff are paid hourly, dentists are commissioned based workers and due to COVID-19 restrictions, the type of work allowed to be performed was heavily reduced. These two points obviously would have caused a dramatic decrease in the businesses earnings for the month of April. With most staff not being able to work, a core skeleton crew was asked to continue working by the owner (a fellow dentist) to see patients for emergency relief of pain during April, myself a part of that team. Although the owner could have been the dentist to work they decided not to as they didn't want to put themself at risk. We asked if the owner was applying for JobKeepers when it was announced as, although still working, I would be earning significantly less than $1500 a fortnight and was told they were looking into their eligibility etc. We were asked to sign JobKeepers forms last Wednesday (22/04). When signing this we had assumed this was for the month of April. I was advised (Tuesday 28/04) the owner had decided not to apply for Jobkeepers for April but will be applying from May onwards. As of May 1st restrictions on dental work have lessened and staff will be returning to mostly normal hours and routine. There will still be a reduction of the critical 30% turnover however, a point ensured by increasing patient appointment times (not costs) and not filling an empty dentist position that was vacant from 31st March (unrelated to COVID-19) thereby only running 4 chairs. As such I believe the boss will be accessing the payments in bad faith by paying us from normal revenue whilst simultaneously claiming Jobkeepers NOT for the intended purposes to pay the staff.

Unfortunately after an afternoon of phone calls, I have been told numerous times this all is technically fine and within the current rules. It is 100% the employers decision.

I can accept it is the employers decision IF they want to participate but to have no considerations for WHEN they apply has resulted in the above issue, a loophole likely to be abused by others.  

Example:

monthly business turnover prior to COVID $10,000 since covid -

for month 1 (severe restrictions in place) - turnover $1,000

for month 2 (less restrictions and 'clever working') - turnover $6,999 (still 30% reduced turnover)

It is the employers choice to only apply for month 2 (at which point they can earn a lot more money and pay staff from normal commission AND also access Jobkeepers)

In this case WHY can an employer choose to register from month 2 onwards when they have chosen NOT to apply in month 1 (when impact was even more significant)

Surely if it wasn't bad enough for them to apply for month 1 to pay their staff, they shouldn't be eligible to apply at a later date - ESPECIALLY WHEN REVENUE INCREASES SIGNIFICANTLY

It was explained that an employer can choose to register for the program in month 7 if they choose and i ask what is the point of this - if none of the staff were paid for 6 months HOW is this purpose of jobKEEPING. 

I have been given the following options:

1 - Make a complaint through ATO tip off line about possible inappropriate usage of job keepers scheme - 

Not one person has guaranteed me this would result in being paid appropriately in April or be an anonymous process and that my job would be secure if i went down this path. Fair-work advised I should really only consider this if i plan to leave the workplace. This is not something i am eager to do. I have worked hard for nearly 5 years to build the trust and friendship of hundreds of patients at this practice. I shouldn't have to leave my position just to point out what I believe are obvious abuses of the situation. 

Leaving would result in me neediing to go on Jobseekers until i could find a new job - obviously tricky in current climate - as well as defeating the purpose of jobkeepers in the first place. 

2 - Seek legal advice - 

I currently see no point in this as several reps from the ATO (facilitators of the jobkeepers) have agreed that the owner is 100% within their legal right to act in this way according to current legislation. 

3 - Leave a complaint with my member of parliament/state senator - the creators of the act. 

I was advised however that as parliament wont sit until 9th of May, this is ultimately futile.

Current Jobkeepers regulations are that any employer wanting to apply for the first fortnight in April must have paid their staff by 8th of May. I ask what is the point of leaving a message with someone if nothing can be done until after it would be able to make a difference. 

Which leaves me with a 4th option suggested by everyone I've spoken with

Suck it up and deal with it. 

Something I could more easily do if this just affected me. But for the 30 odd staff and their families to miss an entire months salary when there are eligible for payments is wrong. 

For there to be NO OTHER OPTIONS OR AVENUES FOR EMPLOYEE SUPPORT IN THIS IS WORSE.  

At this point I am feeling defeated, abused, and helpless.

Rant over. These are obviously stressful times for all. This legislation can do good things, however existing loopholes like this need to be addressed. I hope everyone stays safe and well
