 Victoria records 0 new local cases 🍩 # New cases reported in the last 24 hours

* There have been 0 new cases for **29** days.
* As of 24th November, there are 0 active cases in the state!



**Future VIC updates on** r/CoronavirusDownunder**:** 

Firstly congratulations again to all Victorians for reaching the 28 days! What an amazing achievement! 

Given this milestone and some of the comments yesterday (huge thanks to you guys for the support you showed yesterday and every single day!) I had a think about whether I should continue these posts. 

For now, I think I’ll continue these posts. It’s not really a problem at all and I’m still monitoring things like the wastewater results. I’ll also track the overseas cases once hotel quarantine resumes on the 7th of December. To ensure I don’t give you guys a massive scare once the overseas cases start trickling in, I'll start differentiating the cases as local/overseas/interstate etc. 

As always, feel free to message me if you have any suggestions and feedback!
