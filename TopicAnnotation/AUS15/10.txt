####What is a random thing that gives you anxiety?  

*Big thanks to u/Drnicko18 for suggesting tonight's discussion question, courtesy of [r/meirl](
 &amp;nbsp;  

**Some very funny and relatable answers from that thread include:**  
- Trying to put my change in my wallet at the cash register while people in line put pressure on me by just standing  
- When I’m driving in the rain and my wipers are on super-speed but everyone else’s are casual... is that just me?
