 "Australians who refuse to wear face masks, listen up — there’s a free alternative on offer" [

It's shocking how satire like this has to be used because some people are so convinced that wearing a mask makes it harder for them to breathe. To those people, would you be interested in a mechanical ventilator instead?

I'm Chinese. We are a mask factory in China. We really hope our products can help you. We have a large number of disposable masks and surgical masks. I learned from my friends that there is a shortage of masks in many parts of the world.

We now have 200,000 disposable and surgical masks.

 Will the average citizen be able to purchase n95 masks anytime soon? I, like many other Australians are in need of PPE to wear around vulnerable family members or when going on excursions for supplies. None of the traditional sources for masks have anything available and others stores suddenly selling individual masks (like make up companies and catch.com.au) seem sketchy and untrustworthy given the stories about bootleg masks out of china.

Should we just give up and wear home made masks and hope for the best? Or will there soon be a saturation in the mask market?

 Can we get masks with valves banned? Whenever I go out on public transport and into shops, etc, I diligently wear a mask. I totally but into the whole "a mask is now to protect others than to protect yourself" though clearly it offers some protection.

However, more and more I see others wearing masks with valves. It absolutely infuriates me! I mean, do they think they are helping? Do they think they are doing their civic duty and some how protecting the public? No! They are doing the most selfish thing possible saying "I want to maximise my own protection whilst doing nothing to stop my own virus laden breath passing virtually opposed though the valve in my selfish mask and infecting those around me".

I would rather see no mask at all than the utterly contemptible valve masks.

Mandate masks or don't - but I would like to see valve masks banned (unless one is actively performing an activity that calls for them - spray painting or whatever).

 Face masks vs face shields I live in regional Vic and I popped in to Bunnings today for some essentials. I noticed that half the staff were not wearing masks and only had on those clear plastic visor shields.

 #Masks4All: Make and wear a homemade mask to slow COVID-19 spread

 Protective masks which don't press down hard on your nose I'm looking for masks which are designed so that they don't compress down hard on your nose.

A few factors which I think can probably contribute to this....

\- The fit of the straps. If there's too much tension on the earloops then naturally the mask will put extra force on the front of your face.

\- The face 'nose support' that the mask has. For example, on the standard 3 layer masks with a bendable wire on top, you can press the wire down more so that the mask is putting more force on your cheeks than on your nose.

\- The structural support those mask provides. If your mask can compress the sides of your face more and are preshaped to accommodate for the nose.

All those things being said, how can I actually find masks with these properties? I'm thinking the polypropylene mixed masks might have some more structure or ones with lines down the middle for a nose and offer good protection (according to CBC). What has worked for you guys?

 If You Wear a Mask, Please Wear It So You're Not Wasting It We have a shortage of surgical masks and P2 respirators, so if you're concerned for your own reasons and feel the need to wear one, please let it do its best to protect you. 

A lot of people are promoting masks on this sub, and there are certainly people with legitimate concerns including working in a supermarket while living with a severely immunocompromised person. My aim isn't to tell you whether you should or shouldn't buy and wear masks. I just want to get some people to hear this in the interests of reducing, to any degree, the number of masks that are being worn in ways that are not benefiting the wearer. 

COVID-19 is spread through droplet and contact transmission. Infection control, including transmission-based precautions, is more than just a mask you slap over your nose and mouth. It is a discipline that is taught to healthcare workers. If you're interested, these videos give you some insight into PPE (a part of transmission based precautions) and recommendations for its use with COVID-19:

 [ 

 [ 

The gist is that gloves, gowns, face shields/goggles, and masks work together to protect healthcare workers. That part's the PPE (with masks only one of the four), the discipline is in how and when to perform hand hygiene, how and when to don/doff PPE, and ensuring your PPE is intact while you are wearing it. 

Will masks alone help? Yes, probably, to some extent (also depends on the type of mask). If you wear them correctly. Obviously, masks alone are not as good at defending you against infection as the full rigmarole described in the videos for heathcare workers in close contact with COVID-19 patients.

**So if you wear a mask, please do:**

\-Wash your hands well before putting one on. Washing your hands well means a good scrubbing of all hand surfaces. Use hand sanitiser the same way if you can't wash your hands with soap and water. 

\-Put the mask on and make sure it fits as well as it can. If you have a P2 respirator, ensure there are no gaps between its edges and your face. 

\-Leave it on your face where you put it. 

\-Take it off when it gets damp from your own breath/anything else and discard. If not single-use, follow guidelines for cleaning it. 

\-Wash/sanitise your hands well directly after disposal. 

\-Wash your hands regularly regardless. If you are concerned about droplets getting into your airways, any droplets you encountered will be on your clothes/body/other surfaces as well as on your mask. 

**Please do not:**

\-Pull the mask down below your mouth, then later pull it back up. The outer surface of the mask, if contaminated, will likely have been touched by your hands, portions of your face, neck, and clothing, and the inside surface of the mask. This is no longer of benefit to you. 

\-Scratch your nose/mouth/face through the mask. This not only potentially contaminates your hands, which could go on to touch other things including your eyes, it could dampen the mask or the act of rubbing/scratching could force germs through it. 

\-Pull the mask off, lay it on a surface, then put it back on. Again, you want the inside to be the "safe zone" and to avoid the mask contaminating anything around it. 

\-Forget to wash/sanitise your hands before and after touching anything to do with your mask, your face, mucous membranes, or food/drink. 

\-Leave your nose uncovered or wear a poorly-fitting mask. 

\-Take the mask off incautiously so the outside touches other parts of you, including your eyes. 

If this is all common sense to you, then I apologise for not giving you anything new to learn. I am responding to the mistakes I've seen be made in the hopes people who have gotten themselves masks read this and do not make them. If you have made your own mask out of cloth, this still applies, though unfortunately the benefit of a cloth mask is unlikely to be as good as that of one produced for the purposes of infection control with a tested bacterial filtration efficiency (BFE).

 Medical professionals need to set an example and take the lead - wear masks and practice social distancing! Went to a GP this morning in Melbourne. Most staffs including doctors are not wearing masks. Those wearing them are not doing it properly. After that at Chemist Warehouse the same. Only 1-2 wearing masks. Nobody practices social distancing - customers or staffs. Coming from an Asian country where we managed to flatten the curve, this is incredible. Not sure if I should laugh or cry. Those that say masks don’t work, please take a look at China, HK, Singapore, South Korea and tell me what’s in common among them that managed the outbreak much better. Individuals each taking responsibility by wearing masks and keeping their distance. Medical professionals please start to set an example to others!!

 Yet AGAIN they reposted this article. But if you read till the end and think logically, it never said that masks won't protect you if you ARE wearing them correctly! NEWS.com.au: Coronavirus Australia: Should you be wearing a face mask?.

++++++++++
 Yet another reason why masks protect against community spread of coronavirus, another reason we should be wearing them in public A theory on why widespread mask wearing can help may be because masks prevent a person from subconsciously touching their face, and it makes them aware of touching their face. When outside, touching things that others have touched then touching once's face is particularly risky (and wearing gloves doesn't affect this particular risk at all).  This may possibly explain some of the reason why there is a postulated benefit hypothesized in countries where mask wearing is widespread, in addition to the actual protective effects masks have, which are of course present as well.

 Nursing Home Staff Not Wearing Masks My mother's nursing home in Sydney is not insisting staff wear masks. Some workers there don't realise you don't need to display symptoms to be infected and contagious. 

Is it impossible to have them legally forced by authorities to wear masks?

The average age of death from COV-19 in Italy is 81 so not wearing masks in a home here seems extremely negligent.
++++++++++
 When masks aren't compulsory anymore, will you keep wearing them or ditch them? Feel like most people would stop wearing them immediately. But there will be others that may never go out in public without a mask again. It's certainly removed the stigma that masks are for Asians, but I don't think it's something that is going to catch on, it'll be back to pre-covid very quickly. Personally I wouldn't wear one unless I was sick.

 Have anyone try this streamlined respirator and reusable filters? I have my RD 40mm respirators and filters (that makes me look like I'm cosplaying Metro) but recently, I've found [this respirator]( and supposedly N95 filters on eBay. Have anyone tried them? It can be a more sustainable option compared to disposable N95 masks that are being sold for 5 bucks per mask.

Also found: [here]( and [here](

This is not an advert. I am honestly curious about this Lianyou respirator. it cost about 26 bucks for a respirator + 10 filters and filters bought in bulk can be as cheap as 90 cents each.

 Thoughts on why masks do and don't work TLDR. I think masks are mainly a visible symptom of societies successful in suppressing Covid-19, not the reason for their success. But I think they do play an important psychological role in combating the virus by acting as a constant reminder of the pandemic. And that is why I personally choose to wear a mask.

A lot of people point out simple analogies like Taiwan (insert other successful country) with mask = success, USA (insert other failed country) without mask = failure and conclude that masks must have done it.

I think it is more complicated and that masks are just a symptom, not a cause of countries success in fighting the virus. To me, mask usage is an indicator of a society more toward the collectivist end on the individualism/collectivism spectrum.

Citizens in countries more of a culture of emphasis on the good of the many vs individual rights, are more likely to take steps to protect others and themselves such as staying home where possible, washing hands etc.

Because many believe masks help, that means many of them will wear masks as well. So the masks are just symptomatic of citizens taking steps for the greater good over their personal comfort.

Masks in and of themselves don't help since the virus is small enough to get through non N95 masks that are the majority of what people are wearing.

Yet I think the most important aspect of masks is the psychological effect they have. Admit it, if you are not wearing a mask and walk into a room full of people wearing surgical masks, your human instinct would automatically put you in danger mode. You would act more cautiously.

Masks are scary because they indicate the presence of an invisible threat and act as a constant reminder of the pandemic. It's human nature to tense up when seeing others wearing masks. This I think is one of the drivers of the political backlash to mask wearing. More individualistic people see masks as scary and a symbol of their lost freedoms and react by attacking the symbol.

So if there is a critical mass of mask wearing, then despite them being mere placebo for stopping the virus particles, they do have a very real psychological effect in reminding everyone to be cautious and washing hands, social distancing etc. I think people are a lot more likely to adhere to social distancing if they see a lot of people wearing masks than if they were not.

For this reason alone, I believe mask wearing should be strongly encouraged.

 Which worked, face masks or lockdowns? When Dandrews locked down he also brought in mandatory face masks around the same time.

If people aren’t allowed to go to work, go to the shops, leave their house (only for an hour), have a curfew, a 5km radius, wouldn’t this negate the effectiveness of masks if no one is around? 

So what got Victoria’s numbers down, the lockdown or the masks?
