 COVIDSafe and suspect behaviour I’m just gonna flat out ask the question on everyone’s mind. Will the authorities ever be able to use the data from COVIDSafe to link to behaviour that may considered suspect?

We all know what the apps intended use is, we all know they have said that it’s data will only be used for assisting the community in the Coronavirus crisis - but can they/will they/what will happen if they use the data to assist in other enquires not related to the Covid-19 pandemic?

 Don't flatten the curve, bend it: the fatal flaw in our COVID-19 strategy "Flatten the curve" is one of the great public health messaging success stories of our time. Along with a simple graphic, it has become ubiquitous and remarkably effective in communicating the need for social distancing to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. But for all its impact, it may actually be leading our decision-makers astray: rather than flattening the curve, we should instead be aiming to dramatically "bend the curve" to reduce the total number of infections and save lives.”
