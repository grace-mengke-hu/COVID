 Successful vaccines will take longer to test than failed vaccines So while vaccine trials are being conducted they will be tallying the number of infected within the trial up and when they think there is enough statistical power to unblind the trial they will unblind.

The thing about this process is an ineffective vaccine will have more infected as both the treatment and control groups will be getting infected. So ineffective trials will be ready to unblind and release failures well before successful vaccines. The most effective trials will take the longest time as only half their study group are exposed.

Be prepared to have a number of failures announced before a successful candidate comes forward. It won't be because a vaccine is impossible, it will just be selection bias. But be prepared for a wave of doom and gloom.

 Victoria - Any Chance Certain Areas Will Have Lockdowns Eased? I live in Gippsland. All Local Government Areas in Gippsland have not had an active case in over a month, but we have to live with the tightened restrictions like those in Melbourne do. This is incredibly frustrating. Has there been any political discussion at all about easing restrictions in certain areas of the state?

 NSW reports 1 new local case and 2 new overseas cases # New cases reported in the last 24 hours

* **2** are returned overseas travellers in hotel quarantine
* **1** is locally acquired and was acquired at Concord Hospital:
   * *The locally acquired case worked at Concord Hospital while potentially infectious. The case cared for patients with COVID-19 and further investigation is underway to identify how the infection was acquired.*

**Note:**

&gt;NSW Health advises that further assessments and testing of the case reported in **Murrumbidgee LHD** on Thursday has determined it was a **false positive and therefore not a case**.  
&gt;  
&gt;Testing has decreased this week (down 16%) though overall testing rates remain high. The largest decrease in testing rates this week was evident in school-aged children.  The number of people reporting flu-like symptoms has decreased; this may lead to a reduction in testing rates for COVID-19.  
&gt;  
&gt;Proportion of locally-acquired cases interviewed by public health staff within 1 day of notification to NSW Health = 100%  
&gt;  
&gt;Proportion of close contacts (identified by the case) contacted by public health within 48 hours of case notification = 100%

 Border restrictions that came into effect from midnight have caused traffic gridlock along the southern Gold Coast, but police say motorists are cooperating for the most part. Border restrictions that came into effect from midnight have caused  traffic gridlock along the southern Gold Coast, but police say motorists  are cooperating for the most part. 

"This is not a short-term thing, people have to be prepared for this to happen for quite some time," he said. 

 But traffic is crossing the border more freely heading south, prompting [Byron Shire Mayor Simon Richardson to suggest NSW follow suit by closing the border on the southern side]( 

People who live and work across the border and those who have medical reasons for entering Queensland are being allowed through.  Some motorists are also being allowed into the state on compassionate  grounds and trucks carrying freight are being granted entry. 

 Motorists living on the New South Wales side of the border who are [eligible for an exemption under the new rules can apply for a border pass](

Once granted, it can be printed by the applicant.

Deputy Commissioner Gollschewski said while police officers were not wearing  medical masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE) this  morning, they had that option available to them and were maintaining  adequate social distancing standards. 

 People breaching the border closure rules face a maximum penalty of $13,345.

 Visitors to South Australia will be made to sign a declaration    
Premier Steven Marshall said border towns will still be able to interact, but any outbreak of coronavirus will see that stopped. 

&gt;"There will be 12 land-based stations on our borders. These will, in the first instance, try to utilise the heavy vehicle inspection testing facilities that are currently operated and the biosecurity stations operated by PERSA. "The police will take over the operations of these stations and will also put controls in place at the railway station for where the interstate trains come and the airport. "When people come into South Australia, from four o'clock on Tuesday afternoon, they will be required to understand precisely the orders that will be in place. "They will be asked to sign a declaration that they will self isolate and they will be required to provide SAPOL with information on where they will be undertaking their self isolation. There will be tests on this important declaration and this commitment individuals regarding this very, very important public safety initiative. There will be some arrangements put in place along borders in country South Australia where two towns on either side of the border have a high level of interaction. "People that do live in those communities will be allowed to move between those communities once they have been identified as somebody in one of those communities but, I stress, if there is any reason to believe that there is an outbreak on the immediate other side of the border, then that'll have to also be curtailed. "There will be some logical exemptions to these very strict arrangements and in particular, around freight movements."

NSW Health has updated the missing data that I reported on Wednesday night. The discrepancy between the 1 additional overseas case, and missing local known case from the 6th has been resolved; I think our data friends at NSW Health were a little sleepy when updating the data yesterday - lol. One unknown case from 6th has now also been reclassified as known - *hoorah!*

 Australian dollar plunges to lowest in 18 years  

The Australian dollar has plunged to the lowest since October 2002, with the Reserve Bank set to take unprecedented steps today to help the economy survive the impact of the coronavirus.

As finance reporter Sue Lannin explains, the dollar fell to 55.08 US cents ahead of another expected rate cut by the Reserve Bank this afternoon as volatility gripped currency markets.

At 1:40pm (AEDT), it was down 3.5 per cent to around 55.64 US cents. The currency has lost 20 per cent so far this year.

Westpac senior currency strategist Sean Callow said the panic selling on share markets had spread to foreign exchange markets.

 Government confirms it'll change the partner income test for people on welfare  

The Federal Government has confirmed it'll change the partner-income test for people on welfare, as part of its widespread economic response to the coronavirus crisis.   
   
Currently, it you lose your job and your partner earns more than $48,000 a year you are not eligible for the Jobseeker payment.   
   
But the Finance Minister Mathias Corman has told Insiders host David Speers the government will lift that threshold.   
   
"This is what we'll do, we will ease those restrictions on partner income to ensure more Australians will get income support," Mr Corman said.  
   
"The specifics will be announced in the coming days."

I have not been able to update this table today \[09/09\]. NSW Health has not released today's data and has removed yesterday's data from the dataset. On the 6th, 1 case was identified as a local and linked to a known cluster \[Burwood\]. This is no longer in the updated dataset, and there is instead 1 new entry for the 6th, an overseas case. As soon as new information is available I will update the below table.

^(\*The case reported on the 06/07 worked at both Concord Hospital ED) *^(and)* ^(Liverpool Hospital ED while potentially infectious. Therefore, it is probable that this case is the source of the first Concord Hospital ED case \[07/09\]. In total, NSW Health reports that there are 12 people associated with this cluster, 8 of whom are HCWs, 1 hospital visitor, 1 patient and 2 household contacts of the patient \[09/09\]. While this cluster was first confined to the EDs of each hospital, Dr Chant advises that it is likely to have been transmitted to other areas of the hospital \[09/09\].)
