 Call for volunteers: a small working group to help me make an archive of Scomo's comments over the past months, and continue going forward. I work in archiving, and have worked as a media analyst in the past. If we create an archive of Scomo's comments, constantly contradicting each other and then denying he said them, we will have performed an important public service for now, and for the people who come after this once in a century event. 

I am happy to lead the project. I need three or four other people who can spend preferably 2 hours per day creating a back catalogue of Scomo's comments from January onward. We will need to capture current comments too. Once the backlog is completed, the work will take less time. 

I can create a Google Doc if that's the best way to centralise it. The doc will only be open to our small working group initially, we can discuss the best way to publish it. I'm sure an ISP would donate web space for free, or a graphic designer on here would volunteer to make simple, shareable images from our work.

Together, let's not let this government get away with its failures, which will cost lives. 

Reply here to discuss, or feel free to send me a private message. 

Thanks

 CORONAVIRUS UPDATE PLEASE READ AND COMMENT, ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE POLITICAL EXPERIENCE. The PM announced a major development and I don’t understand why it is been overlooked… I can’t find anyone talking about it in the news or in social media. 

A Human Biosecurity Emergency has been declared which gives the government a whole new set of powers. 

Please read the following and go through the legislation I’ve cited. It won’t change what’s about to happen, but I think people should have hard facts and not have to rely on rumours or news outlets. 

I have learned all I can on my own and I hope a discussion will shed light on what the future holds for us. 

1. On Wednesday March 18th Scott Morrison announced that the National Security Committee (NSC) has declared a “human biosecurity emergency” in accordance with the *Biosecurity Act 2015*. (1) 

2. The NSC is “the peak decision-making body for national security…matters in the Australian Government. It is a committee of the Cabinet of Australia though **decisions of the NSC do not require the endorsement of the Cabinet itself.”** (2)

3. The *Biosecurity Act 2015* “is about managing diseases…that may cause harm to (human health)” and can be found in full on this website: [

4. Chapter 8, Part 2 of the act relates to human biosecurity emergencies. Section 476 specifies that the Health Minister may extend the emergency period for as long as they are satisfied it is necessary (see SECT 476(1) and 476(3)). Basically the Health Minister is solely in charge here. He does not require Cabinet or Parliament approval at this stage. 

5 As you’re about to discover, he can issue any requirements that he is “satisfied” are necessary to “protect human health”. Here are the relevant sections….

**BIOSECURITY ACT 2015 (NO. 61, 2015) - SECT 477** 

**Health Minister may determine emergency requirements during human biosecurity emergency period**

During a human biosecurity emergency period, the Health Minister may determine any requirement that he or she is satisfied is necessary to prevent or control the entry of the disease into Australian or the spread of disease in Australia or to prevent the spread to another country. The Legislative Instruments Act 2003 **does not apply** to the determination. These requirements may include but are not limited to restrictions or preventions of movement of people and goods or evacuations. Any decisions remain in place until the emergency period has ended. A person who fails to comply with a requirement may commit an offence. 

**6** **SECT 478**

**Health Minister may give directions during human biosecurity emergency period**

The minister may give any direction, to any person, that he believes necessary to prevent or control the spread of disease, including (but not limited to) directing people to close or prevent access to a premises. Refusal to comply is an offence. 

7 Failure to comply with requirements under sections 477 or 478 can result in 5 years prison or a $50,000 fine. In the real world it might not come to all that, but you can definitely be arrested and charged. 

8 When you put the three relevant sections together, it appears that the Health Minister can order almost unrestricted requirements of the Australian people as long as the emergency is declared, and the emergency can be extended as many times as the Health Minister decides. 

9 Other issues outlined in the Act include 

\- Powers to enter, search and take samples from premises. 

\- Requirements to provide body samples

\- Requirements to provide information 

\- Powers to “accompany” children and “incapable” people without *first* notifying the parents or caregivers 

\- Powers to seize or destroy goods

\- Requirements for people to receive a vaccine, treatment or medication

\- Forced isolation

&amp;#x200B;

I did summarise the information in the ACT as sections of acts can be long and difficult to read due their formatting. I want everyone to be able to understand and contribute. If you follow the link at the end of this paragraph you will find copy of the act that is easy to navigate, is well divided, and has a clickable contents page. [

If any of this is inaccurate, comment and I will EDIT the post to correct it. I know spreading false information is part of the problem.

 When will normal life resume Just when will things get back to normal? Eg: schools reopening, sport resumes. barbecues and parties resume?

**Trump says everything will get back to normal by Easter, and I am believing him.**   


If things don’t get normal by eatser, when will things get back to normal?

May?

June?

July?   


Seriously I want to go back to school, play basketball for my school, have parties with my mates, fuck girls and have BBQ’s with my friends again. I don’t like lockdown. Hopefully it is only for a few weeks.

 What's some simple activities for an 'Isolation Advent Calendar'? We're currently making a September 'Advent Calendar' for a family member stuck in Stage 4 isolation in Australia. He's a 30 year old male, living alone, in an apartment. 

The calendar will be 30 envelopes, each with a task or activity to complete. 

Ideas so far include making a fort in the lounge room and finding/watching a ted talk that includes chickens.

So reddit, hit us with your wholesome ideas.

 ARE WE REALLY AS STUPID AS COVID MAKES US LOOK???? Regrettably, the answer is an unequivocal **YES, YES, YES.**

COVID has uncovered all that is wrong with us, our society, our values, our humanity.  It has highlighted how we are self-righteous, keen to apportion blame, self-absorbed, unempathetic to the plight of others, void of reason, and the list goes on .... **THE DAILY DIATRIBE IS TRULY SICKENING**. 

Sure, the hotels were a debacle, the tracing wasn't up to fight, poor decisions have been made, but.  how many world leaders have made poor decisions in battling this.  Why has Victoria copped this so badly?  For the same reason NSW, who let hundreds of COVID positive Ruby Princess travellers roam the Sydney CBD.  **LUCK.**  It just so happens that we had **BAD** luck while NSW had **GOOD** luck.  

Now we have been reduced to arguing whether the lives of the elderly are worth protecting at the cost of possibly destroying our economy for years to come.  We seem happy to ignore one other salient issue.  The elderly are dying because they don't have the strength to fight the disease, yet by far the greatest cohort to acquire the virus, by far, is 20 to 39 y.o.

Even though we are hearing stories of people in these age groups having real issues regaining their health months after acquiring the virus, we seem willing to ignore this so we can go back to the lives we had.  This virus is new.  We have no idea what the long term effects of acquiring it might be.  As every day goes by, we do learn more. Global statistics, still far from proof, presently suggest that 20% of people aged in the largest infected age range are not fully recovering months later.   If this percentage is within cooee of accurate, that translates to 3,000 - 4,000 Victorians (on current numbers) in the prime of their lives, possibly having to live with chronic disease for the rest of their lives.  650 deaths are 650 too many, even if the bulk were elderly.  But what about those (5 times as many) that have the rest of their lives ruined by sickness.  **WHY ARE WE IGNORING THE SIGNS OF THE LONGER TERM EFFECTS OF THIS VIRUS?????**  

We only have one choice with this scourge, and that is to reduce the numbers to as close as zero as possible before we start thinking about life as going back to normal.  

**WHAT ABOUT THE ECONOMY?**  Australia has one of the lowest ratios of debt to GDP in the world.  We are presently at around 45% (after the last stimulus packages), whilst many developed nations are far higher ... the US has been around 100% for years.  Has that debt affected these countries???  Who do we pay that debt back to in any case???  We can afford to assist those in need for some time yet.  The fact is, it will have little if any effect on future generations.  We are an island nation isolated from the rest of the world.  We have a better chance of reducing this virus to negligible effect than almost any other nation.  Until a vaccine arrives, or at the least, we discover medication that mitigates the harmful effects of the virus, **WE ONLY HAVE ONE SENSIBLE CHOICE.  WE HAVE TO KILL THE VIRUS OFF AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE, WHILST FINANCIALLY AND MEDICALLY SUPPORTING THOSE WHO NEED HELP.**  &gt;! DOING OTHERWISE IS SIMPLY MADNESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;

 Local infection data Is there a source for a local view of where infections are? The state level view is nice for some countries, but here the states are so large they can't really inform behaviour. If Sydney has cases but Port Macquarie doesn't then decisions can be made, but saying NSW has cases is not useful in this way.

 Jobkeeper is shit - part 2, wasted Boogaloo A lot of people in my [first post] ( commented that they disagreed, and used anecdotal evidence to justify this. I don't think the concept is shit; the execution is runny shit.

First you have incidences of employer/employee conflict like [this] ( Stories of employers demanding a change in working conditions, or employees refusing to turn up. There are also cash flow problems to pay it and be credited via tax. It should go directly to the employee.

Second, there are lots of workers, participants of the economy, missing out. Casuals should get it. International students should get it. If you paid tax before, you should get it now. Fight me.

Lastly, you should get an amount equal to your regular pay capped at $750 a week. That saved cash could pay the people who missed out. Easy peesy.

Interested to see if people agree with me now the dust has settled.

 Does anyone think that in light of the pandemic, the demand for Australian made products will genuinely increase? I have heard many people talk about their future purchase choices being geared towards ensuring it is Australian made. This is great news, however I can't help but wonder if this is just talk and no action for the present time. If it does however prove to be true that there is a significant shift, what do you think this might mean for business and production in Australia? Do you have any hopes towards this?
