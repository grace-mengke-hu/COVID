 Will we get notice of a lockdown? Does anyone know if we will get notice of a lockdown, and how much time is normally given?  I've been googling to see how China &amp; Italy have done it but can't find any answer. 

Personally, I believe some sort of a lockdown is inevitable now. First stages are already happening; no spectators at sports. Officials are talking about extending the school holidays. This all happened before lockdown in other countries. 

At the moment my sister in law's sister who lives in WA is travelling for the next month here in VIC &amp; Tassie for work (she's a self employed muso). She doesn't want to be stuck over here, so is wondering if she'd get notice to be able to fly back to her home - anyone know? Or know how we could find out?

 Are you ready for a real Lockdown? A point made on Triple J Hack today by the Deputy chief medical officer was the difference with what they are currently doing Vs what a proper lockdown is.

He calls it "asking us to lockdown" VS "Making us lockdown"

So if a full lockdown is the later, are you guys ready for this?

 different rules for single people than couples who live apart stage 3 restrictions find it extremely unfair that partners who don’t live together can visit each other but if you are single you can’t nominate one person to be your support person during lockdown. it’s the same thing and quite cruel. couples won’t be social distancing so technically two people who aren’t in a relationship is a safer visit and should be able to nominate each other as their face to face person, it’s no different to couples visiting each other.

 What if Melbourne is all under the same level of restrictions but "hotspot" areas are somehow barricaded to restrict movement in and out? I know the last postcode lockdown didn't work but hear me out.

My LGA has had zero active cases for a while now, as do most LGAs around it. 

Now I don't advocate us taking the restrictions off here slower than other LGAs, but we containing the virus surely seems like a wise choice now. It's worked for regional VIC and I think it could work for these LGAs that are still forming the bulk of new cases months down the track.

Even in the next stage of restrictions (tba soon) people still only have the 4 reasons to leave home, and unlike the last postcode lockdown, people won't be going freely in and out to work in other suburbs and mixing with other people from other LGAs. 

Is this a possible strategy? I know logistically it'd be hard but the federal government (if they're as serious as they claim to be about rescuing the country) could surely send in more ADF to help this.

####Tonight I’m interested to hear about what Halloween means to you. Did you grow up celebrating it, or perhaps only as an excuse to have a party as an adult? Do your kids trick or treat? Also, feel free to share your best ghost story! 👻

 In the event of a lockdown would income protection insurance cover wages? I have income protection insurance and in the event of a lockdown I would not earn a wage. 


Would income protection cover this or would I have to be sick with Coronavirus?

 I was just kicked out of a FB corona virus Australia page Well, tbf, I’m not gutted that the admin of an Australian page who is a right wing Trump
Supporter and who is using the page to now post pro Trump propaganda (with a speech from him being elected with zero relevance to covid-19 and them telling people to vote for trump) booted me.

I am disappointed however that the admin who does that gets to now prey on all the panicked people posting unchecked. 

Their stance is now blaming left wing overseas conspiracies. People like them are partly why people are hoarding items in an unnecessary way. 

The blaming Obama for having the audacity to try and make healthcare accessible or something has nothing to do with Australia or this situation. 

I want Australia relevant information. 

And I want correct up to date information and productive discussion which I’ve seen we are all good at here. 

So thanks to everyone here for the discussion, information and community.
