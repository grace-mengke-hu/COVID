 How would you deal with getting the virus while living in a shared household? How would you avoid infecting other people, like family or housemates?

I’ve read stories about people who have been unable to avoid infecting the people they live with. And the most tragic outcome is one of those people might not be able to recover. So even if we did we’d still have to live with knowing we’re responsible for someone’s passing.

I think I could live with the virus. I just don’t know if I could ever live with myself knowing I’d caused someone else to get sick and it being my fault.

 Second confirmed case in the Hunter BREAKING | SECOND CONFIRMED CASE OF COVID-19 IN THE HUNTER

By

 Samantha Poate

 -

March 14, 2020

A woman in her 60s is the second person in the Hunter to be diagnosed with Coronavirus.

She’s now in isolation at home, with Hunter New England Health staff performing daily checks on her.

The female in her 60s has not travelled internationally recently and the source of her infection is still being investigated.

She received outpatient care at the Calvary Mater Newcastle Radiation Oncology Unit between March 4 and 12.

New South Wales Health says any patients or staff who are possible casual contacts are being contacted as a precaution, and the woman’s close contacts have been alerted and asked to self-isolate.

There is no connection between this COVID-19 case and the previous one from earlier in the week.

 Hi guys who else is being harassed and bombarded by Job active now obligations are restored. Also I will explain why they behave so horribly. I've been shifted to category B. Unemployed for over 6 months and to a (new to Jobactive) worker. She calls and emails me multiple times per week even knowing I am doing a Tafe course. (cert II priority courses) 

I get called or emailed about three times a week. Apparently this is far from the worst that happens to people.

Anyway did you know Job Active members get paid quite huge sums of money if you get a job. Even if you work 1hour a week for $20.

If you are there for four weeks they get a bonus. If are there 12weeks they get a bigger bonus and if you are there six months they get almost $10,000 bonus.

Stream A people amount to small bonuses. 
Stream B (6months+)amount to larger bonuses and placing
Stream C  (the long term unemployed)  amounts to the biggest bonuses.

I can't find the website that detailed the exact amounts but they were significant. The figures are in the thousands up to $10,000 and i can see why providers are aggressive and pushy.

Also when you are first referred, the government gives them $391 to refer you to them. 


If anyone finds the webpage detailing the massive bonuses employment agents get for placing job seekers when they are on job active  please please add it to the comments or i will keep searching tonight and tommorow.

 Thoughts on a write-up to spread among my friends Hey guys, I'm a stranded European currently waiting for my next possible flight outta here. This sub opened my eyes to how much of a shit show this was gonna be in Australia as well last week (starting \[here\]([ and I pulled up my girlfriend's (who's visiting) flight date and joined her (I'm on a WHV), but it wasn't soon enough and now we're here.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently sheltered at a good friend's house who lives with a bunch of Aussies and yesterday it finally sunk in it's gonna hit here, too. So now I want to try and put together a post that can quickly drive the point across how important it is to take measures when the govt doesn't take enough and what those measures should be. Any pointers would be appreciated! Essentials I've missed, better links, whatever it may be. The sheer amount of data is pretty overwhelming.

&amp;#x200B;

The Australian government had a chance to prevent a major outbreak of the current pandemic and has failed to do so. New Zealand is trying to take the chance. Here you can see what a timely response to the Novel Corona outbreak looks like, including a 4 week shutdown: [ | [ | (1)

&amp;#x200B;

Corona facts

&amp;#x200B;

\- In most countries, numbers double every 3 days. (2)

&amp;#x200B;

\- Looking at official numbers, the spread's exponential nature is visible. [ | [ (taken from reddit hub \[0\]) 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Daily updated forecast: [

&amp;#x200B;

\- Official numbers might be underreported. (based on other governments' underreporting and assuming the worst)

&amp;#x200B;

\- Low test volume due to lack of kits guarantees the actual case numbers are already way higher. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- In many cases affected people do not show symptoms while still spreading the virus further.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Quoting from a teacher's personal account (3): "the virus lives in the air for hours(4), on surfaces for days(5) and plumes are sprayed with the flushing of toilets(6)".

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\- Incubation time until symptoms show takes 4-14 days.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Potential mass spread events will only manifest themselves in the data within 1-2 weeks time (Schools still being open, clubs and bars shutting down way late \[7\], last minute 'the pub is closing soon'-outings, Bondi beach as an example \[8\], packed CentreLink queues, docking cruise ships being allowed to disembark \[9\]). 

&amp;#x200B;

What you can do

&amp;#x200B;

\- STAY THE INSIDE AND PRACTICE PROPER HYGIENE!

&amp;#x200B;

\- Wash your hands often and wash them well. [

&amp;#x200B;

\- Disinfect your hands well when not possible to wash.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Avoid touching your face at all times.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Sneeze / cough into your elbow.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Flush toilet with lid closed.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Keep social interactions and number of people you interact with to a bare minimum. Keep within your house unit if possible. Live as if you were sure you had it and everybody else was in the risk group.

 Who can I contact with questions about moving house under lockdown? So my partner and I are supposed to be moving out of Melbourne to regional Victoria for work before the end of September.  We have planned the move for after the 14th when the stage four lockdown was due to end but obviously that date has changed now.  I assume it's "allowed" if we have proof of employment and a lease, but no idea about hiring removal services or if there's a possibility that the two other people we currently live with can help with driving a hired truck and our two cars out of Melbourne.  Because otherwise we have to do two trips in and out of Melbourne ourselves to get everything to our new place.  Who could I contact about this?  Local police station?  The DHHS covid hotline was relatively unhelpful.

How is a vehicle MORE risky (for spreading COVID-19) than driving to a park, beach, surfing, fishing, cafe for takeaway food, coffee or alcohol? I don't like booze or coffee. Why can addicts drive for "essentials" yet my enjoyment (a short drive) is considered illegal?

 Protesters are not 'of sound mind': NSW Police Minister NSW Police Minister David Elliott has urged people to not attend the "Rally and Vigil for George Floyd" protest in Sydney on Saturday, telling 2GB's Ben Fordham the 26,000 who have indicated attendance on the event's Facebook page are "not normal".

"I don't think anyone who goes out during a pandemic and joins a mass gathering is of sound mind," he said.

The event, which is being hosted by three local activist groups at Town Hall at 3pm, has been authorised by the NSW Police.

"As the Premier said yesterday, there are things in our society that it is virtually impossible to stop," Mr Elliott said when pressed on the decision.

The Police Minister added that, had the event not been approved, be believed the organisers would have gone to the Supreme Court.

"The people who attend these gatherings during a pandemic don't care what their parents say," he said.

Earlier in the show, in response to a caller suggesting the "do-gooders" who will attend the event had not downloaded the COVIDSafe app, Fordham said he thought there would "likely be some anti-vaxxers" in the crowd.

Settling into his role as Alan Jones' replacement, Fordham later said it was a double standard that Saturday's event was approved while Anzac Day marches had been cancelled.

Anzac Day occurred when restrictions only allowed for gatherings of two people in NSW.

 Is COVID 19 seasonal? Gladys Berijiklian commented upon the last day of winter and how it might mean a reprieve, so I thought I would do some investigation into the potential for seasonal fluctuations in COVID-19.

The question comes up a lot, is there any seasonality to COVID 19 spread? [All the common cold coronavirus follow seasonal trends]( ([Edridge et al.]( and with similar viral pathways it seems possible for COVID 19 to follow similar trends. Variability of spread of a virus will be dependent on three main things, social distancing, population immunity and seasonality, and discerning which of these variables is having the most impact on spread is incredibly difficult. But let's just look at the overall global picture; I split countries into three groups, seasonal northern hemisphere, seasonal southern hemisphere and tropical. [Deaths follow the pattern you would expect a seasonal disease to follow.]( Death rate drops in the northern hemisphere while it warms up and death rates increase in the southern hemisphere through winter following the same pattern of seasonal coronavirus.  Although tropical countries and countries in summer are still seeing spread it is significantly less than winter countries. If the virus can spread inside at 21C then it can spread in summer. A/C may be keeping this virus going all year round, something we didn't see during the Spanish Flu.

[Sajadi et al]( found that "The distribution of significant community outbreaks along restricted latitude, temperature, and humidity are consistent with the behavior of a seasonal respiratory virus." 

Cold warehouse work places have [been troublesome for spread,]( also indicating an increased spread risk in cold air.

If there is significant seasonal variability then it means we have probably weathered the storm and have the next 9 months with an easier path. The northern hemisphere however may be in for worsening conditions as the sun comes back down our way.

 Coronavirus crisis leaves backpackers broke, stranded in Australia A lot of these backpackers are stranded because they left leaving to the last minute, they thought it was just a flu and it would blow over in a few weeks and they would be back to partying and enjoying their holiday. The article mentions they are all heading north now looking for work on the farms but as somebody who live in a farming community in Far North Queensland I know that the backpackers who lost their jobs in hospitality around here have filled any remaining vacancies. The farmers here are also very nervous about these backpackers from down south bringing the virus onto their farms and risking infecting their other workers and shutting down their farms under quarantine. They've left themselves in a very bad position and unless governments (ours and theirs) start helping them return home then their situations will only get even more bleak.

The Federal Government is considering helping Qantas and Virgin operate specific services to bring Australians stuck overseas home.

But with many flights cancelled, the government says it is in talks with Australian airlines to put on new flights to bring people home.

It says this will only be done on a case-by-case basis, where all other commercial options have been exhausted, where local authorities permit flights, and only to those outside the epicentre of the outbreak.

We aren’t testing for community transmission so how the can he say that our cases are imported and we are not on the same trajectory as Italy?? I don’t understand.

 Will I be allowed treatment? Hi all I have a question if anyone can chime in. I am a 18 year old citizen here with no recent travel history but I fear that I have developed the virus. I kinda have a lump in my throat it doesn't feel sore at all like something is stuck there, no runny nose and no fever but a weird feeling in my chest. The lump and chest thing have only come today but I have been constantly monitoring my health for the past couple days since it hiked here in Australia. The chest pain kinda feels like when you've heard bad news and your heart drops but it feels constant, like a shallow pain. I've had some issues with breathing 2 years ago before but it wasn't deemed serious and everything checked out medically. But these are like the 3 symptoms right? I cannot tell if it is or I am just constantly worrying about my health that I think I have it. Not to mention this situation has been quite stressful to juggle around school and home life. 

Anyways, I was wondering that if I did contract the virus and am developing it, would I be allowed treatment or even a test? I am hearing so much people are being turned away from tests and treatment or sent in circles of procedure that end nowhere. Also seeing/hearing that our gov isn't doing much in terms of mitigation and going BAU, it seems hopeless to even attempt to seek medical help because I feel like they will tell me to just self isolate, and wait for it to pass. Hearing that our healthcare system will also probably not be able to handle all the cases, will I most likely be left to fend for myself? Do we have to be in super critical condition to even qualify for being in the ICU or getting tested? Genuinely asking here and I am based in VIC if it's anything.

 As someone who’s uninformed, how comparable is our situation to Italy? I know we have similar case numbers to them 3 weeks ago and similar growth rates, but I wanted to ask if other variables that influence our risk are similar? Such as median age, population density, healthcare sector capacity, connectivity, etc. I just want to have a better idea of how much of a warning of the future Italy is.

 NSW: Another pub, the Macarthur Tavern in Campbelltown, announces COVID-19 case Another pub in south-west Sydney says it has been informed by NSW Health that a patron who attended their venue has tested positive for coronavirus.

The Macarthur Tavern in Campbelltown shared the news on Facebook this morning.

The patron attended the venue on Saturday between 9pm and midnight, it said in the post.

“There is no requirement for the premises to shut down or for any member of staff or patron to self-isolate but they will need to remain vigilant for any respiratory symptoms and get tested immediately and self-isolate should symptoms develop,” it added.

It is not known if the case was reported in yesterday's numbers, or linked to the Crossroads Hotel outbreak.

The pub will reopen at 3pm today after a deep clean.

NSW Health has been contacted for comment.

 Are we rationing screening in Australia?  I work as a nurse in Australia in one of the major metropolitan hospitals which is supposed to be opening up a Covid-19 screening clinic. I work in a ward with a suspected case and they are not doing an extended PCR screening to confirm whether it's coronavirus because "it's expensive" as per the head nurse... The patient has tested negative for flu but continues to have flu like symptoms. So, it seems like we're rationing screening.

 Coronavirus: NSW public school principals told to cancel or delay students' overseas trips. Ban does not apply to independent schools in Australia but Catholic school system will decide ‘case by case’.  

Public schools in [New South Wales]( have been told to stop overseas excursions amid growing concern about the spread of the coronavirus in Australia.

After [the first two cases of community transmission in NSW](  were confirmed this week, the state’s education department wrote to  principals instructing them to cancel or delay overseas trips.

“Many of our schools have planned overseas travel or excursions to  occur during the year,” the letter said. “However, with the current  Covid-19 situation, the safety of our students and staff is paramount  and it is for this reason that all overseas excursions are required to  be now placed on hold until further notice.

“If you have an excursion planned for later in term one you will need  to make the necessary arrangement to cancel the excursion or consider  rescheduling until later in the year.”

Students returning from China and Iran already must self-isolate for  14 days, but banning overseas trips goes beyond the advice from the  foreign affairs and trade department.

The ban does not apply to independent schools, although the Catholic school sector said it would decide “case by case”.

Other states, including Queensland and Victoria, have no formal ban on travel although some schools have cancelled trips.

“At this stage no blanket ban has been imposed with regards to  overseas school excursions,” the Queensland education minister, Grace  Grace, said.

“As with all issues relating to coronavirus, we take advice from the  chief health officer and in consideration of Department of Foreign  Affairs and Trade advice.

“I am aware that some schools have reconsidered their overseas travel  plans and have postponed trips until later in the year. Should the  advice change to warrant a blanket ban, we will act accordingly.”

In Western Australia, education officials have told students to stay  home if they have been in close contact with a confirmed case of  coronavirus “irrespective of whether they have developed symptoms”.

The NSW Health pandemic plan lists schools as potential overflow  facilities in a worst-case scenario where hospitals are overrun.  However, the plan said school closures might not be effective in  stopping the spread of the virus.

“It is important to note that school closures have only been shown to  be moderately effective at reducing transmission rates and the timing  and duration of closures would need to be carefully considered,” the  plan states.

“Therefore a range of measures designed to help reduce social mixing  of students in order to reduce transmission of the pandemic virus may be  considered.”

Last week the West Australian chief health officer, Andrew Robertson, said the state would consider closing schools [if officials believed it would limit the spread of the virus](

Schools would be closed only if “we believe there had been a spread  in a community and that we wanted to limit that spread further in that  community and felt that schools were a place that spread may be  occurring”.

“One of the challenges here is that we don’t really know what the  spread will be in the community, but based on other countries we have to  prepare for significant numbers of our population, whether that’s tens  of thousands or less numbers, it’s hard to say,” he said.

 Amateur exponential modelling I've been recording the daily cases in Google Sheets since we were about 50 cases in Australia. I have a mathematics degree but am by no means an expert. I'm just looking at the available data in a fairly superficial way here, and not looking at anything deeper than the data. Any year 11 student could do this.

Here is the trend for the total confirmed cases up starting from when we hit 100 cases (9th March) to yesterday.

The grey line is an exponential regression line, that is, a line of best fit using an exponential model (something of the form y=ae^(bx) where x is the days since 100 cases, and y is the total number of cases. The close the R^(2) value is to 1, the better the model 'hugs' the data points.



Notice the bend in the data on day 15 (24th March). The cases are still increasing, but the rate at which they are increasing has changed. Previously to this, most daily cases increased by at least 20%. Since day 15, the daily increase has been 13-16%.

Below are two separate graphs of these two time periods.

**Days 0-15 (9th - 24th March)**



**Days 15-19 (24th - 28th March)**



The last few days, although increasing at a lower rate than previously, is still increasing exponentially. Be very careful if you hear someone say that that we are flattening the curve already. The lower rate of increase is most likely due to the bans on travel. Current testing focuses on those who have travelled. I expect a change in trajectory again if we have a change in the criteria for testing.

 Just an FYI from the health professionals [Clinical Excellance Commision NSW Health](

The ANZIC guidelines have a lot of these recommendations.

The recommendations are:

Patient's with COVID be treated in a negative pressure room - the hospital I work in has 6!! The ICU in our hospital I'm not sure even has any. If there is no negative pressure rooms use single rooms. Our ICU has 2 single rooms!! Our ED has 0 single rooms in the resuscitation area.

If there is 1 case in an open area everyone in that area needs to wear a n95/p2 mask, gown, gloves, hair cover, eye protection (hopefully a face shield and not just goggles). If this is you or your family the likelihood of having visitors is so low as we have none of this equipment for them to wear. We barely have equipment for staff.

Guess what? It is recommended things like CPR and Intubation (breathing tube) are done in a negative pressure room or Single room. With staff wearing the correct protective equipment. That means if you or your loved one come into ED and are not breathing and we suspect COVID, CPR WILL NOT start unless it is safe for staff and other people in the hospital. We are not meant to bag (breath for) these patients. We are not meant to start chest compressions until the patient has a breathing tube in.

It is not recommended for us to use things like CPAP or BIPAP. High flow nasal oxygen can be used but recommended in negative pressure rooms or with the correct protective equipment.  

Please think about these things when you don't want to social distance.

 Healthcare worker at Hornsby Hospital tests positive (smh) A healthcare worker in the emergency department at Hornsby Hospital has tested positive for COVID-19 and NSW Health in the process of identifying members of the public who may need to self-isolate.

The staff member worked one shift while infectious on August 6, from 11am to midnight, a spokeswoman for the health department said.

"The staff member became unwell after their shift and immediately self-isolated and got tested for COVID-19," she said.

The person was wearing a mask while in contact with patients.

However, NSW Health is currently in the process of identifying members of the public who had contact with the healthcare worker so they can be notified, the spokeswoman said.

Other hospital staff who had contact with the person have already been identified and instructed to self-isolate for 14 days.

The healthcare worker was diagnosed with the virus on Saturday and is a household contact of another person who was also confirmed as a COVID-19 case on the same day.

"There is no impact on the services being provided by the Emergency Department," the spokeswoman said.

 Iron Lungs I know this idea will initially seem pretty absurd, and maybe it is, but hear me out. During the 1940s and 1950s polio epidemics in Australia due to immense shortages in ventilation equipment people produced iron lungs out of plywood in workshops and a lot of people were actually saved by these efforts.

If there is a serious ventilator shortage in Australia, it seems like making iron lungs would be the easiest way to produce ventilation equipment from readily available items because they are extremely low tech devices. Whereas making something equivalent to a modern ventilator would be difficult, require electronic knowledge and introduces the possibility of doing more harm than good if the design was imperfect. I don't know it is probably a bad idea but groups of people could quite easily build them and it seems like it would be much better than nothing. 

I don't think it is likely that I myself would require such support as I am young and quite athletic but I'm thinking about the community at large. I've heard about ventilator rationing in Italy and being on the wrong end of that can't be good.

 3rd Update. I am one of the 3000 Residents locked down in the 9 Towers. This is what happened to us in the last 2 days. AMA 7th July (Yesterday) 
On this day I woke up to another supply of food being delivered. We received another bag of food from woolworths, it contained bread, tuna, sugar, milk, eggs, pasta and pasta sauce, Noodles as well.
The package was amazing. We ate good that day, i am thankful for that delivery. Kids are occupied on the game but only one can use it at a time, no activity box they want to go to the playground. Daniel andrews said they would ensure kids would be provided entertainment, all they got was from funkybandit, the gov has given nothing so i dont know why it says they have all over the media. 

I went down to get tested later that day. No police on my floor, couldnt see any. I got to the bottom floor and was at the testing site, gave my details and was told to sit in a chair and tilt my head back, she took out the swab stick and put it down my throat on both sides. Easy. Then she went and put it soooo deep in my nose that i couldnt stand it. I was grabbing my leg so hard. I almost got brain damage how much she was spinning it. Hope i never have to do it again.
Just waiting on the results. Rest of the day just chilling. I want to get outside i dont like being indoors all day.

8th July
Reports came in and video footage of the SES confiscating food. Few people saying that they took it out of the rain and that they were checking for drugs. I remember the food being in red bags and i never got food in red bags. We got a box of meat today so thats good. Nurses starting going door to doors to test people which is good. I know for a fact that tomorrow at around 6pm which is the end of the 5 days will not result in freedom. I hope it does but chances are too low. No Cooked meals or snacks so far, not complaining just letting you guys know. Everyone in my house wants this to end as soon as possible.

Regarding the hardship payments. 
1500 eligible for workers who get tested positive
(i am a worker but i doubt I'm sick)
750 eligible for unemployed
(I have a job)
Again i slip through the cracks i have never been able to receive support from the government in my life due to hidden conditions.

Police presence within the building is low but outside there are a ton. Young man got arrested brutally for trying to deliver food to starving resident inside (probably related). We will see whether the complete lockdown is lifted so i can go back to work. Still basically no communication apart from the speakers, we are being treated like criminals but dont know what we have done. Hope no racism is going on.
Thanks again to the community.

 Letter from my son’s school today (Brisbane)  

9/03/2020

 

A special message to the parents and caregivers of students at ****** College

 

Dear Parents and Caregivers




I am writing to further update you about the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) as it relates to ***** College.

Today, we were advised that an adult brother of one of our students has shown some cold/flu type symptoms after recently returning from Indonesia.  This person has submitted themselves to Queensland Health for testing and the results should be known in about 24 hours.  

This person’s younger brother who attends our College, has volunteered to self-quarantine until test results are known.  

I want to stress that the student at our College has no signs or symptoms of illness but is self-isolating purely as a precaution and in the interests of our school community.

I wanted to make this information available to you so that you had accurate information about his matter.

Our thoughts are with the family at this time and we thank them for their cooperation as we continue to work with health authorities.

We have been liaising with the Queensland Catholic Education Commission (QCEC) and Queensland Health on this matter and there remains a low risk in relation to our College.  

I wanted to make this information available to you so that you can be alert to your own son’s health.  Again, there is little likelihood of transmission within our College and I am advised that there is no need for other students or staff to be isolated at this time.

Our College always follows the advice of public health authorities in these circumstances and I thank you for your support to date as we navigate this situation.

Across the State, communities remain alert to the potential spread of the virus and how it may impact us all.  I would like to reassure you that the health and well-being of your son remains our number one priority.  

Queensland Health is urging all communities to continue to be extra vigilant about health and hygiene at this time and to that end, we sent an earlier communication to parents and students around preventative measures and hygiene practices. I ask that you spend some time as a family discussing these preventative measures from the earlier communique. 

We have these strategies in place in our College and students will be reminded of them in Pastoral Care class tomorrow.  We will continue to stress the importance of these behaviours. 

As already communicated, the current advice in place by the health authorities is:

·           If you have left, or transited through mainland China in the last 14 days, you must isolate yourself for 14 days from the date of leaving mainland China;
·           If you have left, or transited through Iran or South Korea you must also now self-isolate for 14 days from the date of leaving these countries;

·           If you have been in close contact with a proven case of coronavirus, you must isolate yourself for 14 days from the date of last contact with the confirmed case.

For more information refer to the Queensland Health website:  or call 13Health.

Queensland Health continues to actively manage this situation across the State, and I will keep you informed on the back of any further advice from Queensland Health. 

Again, thank you for your ongoing support in keeping our students and community healthy and hygienic.

I work in the public transport sector in Melbourne and I am really starting to get worried about my health in this strange time we are all going through, due to a family illness over the past 18 months I have used up nearly all my leave, i have small children at home and due to the above illness my wife is not in the best health and my mother in law is in the very high risk category(COPD, Diabeties and in her 70's) we have prepped  the house and have a decent amount of provisions but I am worried that i am going to bring the virus back home, it does not seem like the company is taking it seriously at all and all they have done is place some hand washing signs on the notice board. Any other public transport workers around Australia worried by the lack of action or prep happening right now for the petree dish that is our public transport system.
