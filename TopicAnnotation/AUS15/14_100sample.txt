# Sources of confirmed cases - last updated 7:00 PM [10/09]

NSW Health has updated the missing data that I reported on Wednesday night. The discrepancy between the 1 additional overseas case, and missing local known case from the 6th has been resolved; I think our data friends at NSW Health were a little sleepy when updating the data yesterday - lol. One unknown case from 6th has now also been reclassified as known - *hoorah!*

^(\*The case reported on the 06/07 worked at both Concord Hospital ED) *^(and)* ^(Liverpool Hospital ED while potentially infectious. Therefore, it is probable that this case is the source of the first Concord Hospital ED case \[07/09\]. In total, NSW Health reports that there are 12 people associated with this cluster, 8 of whom are HCWs, 1 hospital visitor, 1 patient and 2 household contacts of the patient \[09/09\]. While this cluster was first confined to the EDs of each hospital, Dr Chant advises that it is likely to have been transmitted to other areas of the hospital \[09/09\].)

I have not been able to update this table today \[09/09\]. NSW Health has not released today's data and has removed yesterday's data from the dataset. On the 6th, 1 case was identified as a local and linked to a known cluster \[Burwood\]. This is no longer in the updated dataset, and there is instead 1 new entry for the 6th, an overseas case. As soon as new information is available I will update the below table.

^(\*The case reported on the 06/07 worked at both Concord Hospital ED) *^(and)* ^(Liverpool Hospital ED while potentially infectious. Therefore, it is probable that this case is the source of the first Concord Hospital ED case \[07/09\]. In total, NSW Health reports that there are 12 people associated with this cluster, 8 of whom are HCWs, 1 hospital visitor, 1 patient and 2 household contacts of the patient \[09/09\]. While this cluster was first confined to the EDs of each hospital, Dr Chant advises that it is likely to have been transmitted to other areas of the hospital \[09/09\].)

 I was just kicked out of a FB corona virus Australia page Well, tbf, I’m not gutted that the admin of an Australian page who is a right wing Trump
Supporter and who is using the page to now post pro Trump propaganda (with a speech from him being elected with zero relevance to covid-19 and them telling people to vote for trump) booted me.

I am disappointed however that the admin who does that gets to now prey on all the panicked people posting unchecked. 

Their stance is now blaming left wing overseas conspiracies. People like them are partly why people are hoarding items in an unnecessary way. 

The blaming Obama for having the audacity to try and make healthcare accessible or something has nothing to do with Australia or this situation. 

I want Australia relevant information. 

And I want correct up to date information and productive discussion which I’ve seen we are all good at here. 

So thanks to everyone here for the discussion, information and community.

* Investigations to date have been unable to link three cases reported this week with known cases or clusters.

 Centrelink COVID-19 Supplement - has anyone else received their fortnightly payment but nothing regarding the supplement? Hey guys,

My payment date for Youth Allowance falls on today and I received my usual \~$300; however was expecting the additional $550 supplement seeing as it is beyond April 27th - however there is nothing regarding this on my Centrelink homepage or payments page. 

Anybody else in a similar position?

 NSW reports 1 new local case and 2 new overseas cases # New cases reported in the last 24 hours

* **2** are returned overseas travellers in hotel quarantine
* **1** is locally acquired and was acquired at Concord Hospital:
   * *The locally acquired case worked at Concord Hospital while potentially infectious. The case cared for patients with COVID-19 and further investigation is underway to identify how the infection was acquired.*

**Note:**

&gt;NSW Health advises that further assessments and testing of the case reported in **Murrumbidgee LHD** on Thursday has determined it was a **false positive and therefore not a case**.  
&gt;  
&gt;Testing has decreased this week (down 16%) though overall testing rates remain high. The largest decrease in testing rates this week was evident in school-aged children.  The number of people reporting flu-like symptoms has decreased; this may lead to a reduction in testing rates for COVID-19.  
&gt;  
&gt;Proportion of locally-acquired cases interviewed by public health staff within 1 day of notification to NSW Health = 100%  
&gt;  
&gt;Proportion of close contacts (identified by the case) contacted by public health within 48 hours of case notification = 100%
