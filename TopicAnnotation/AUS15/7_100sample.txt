 How do you ask your boss if you should go into the office? I work in a design agency and it isn't exactly essential. Despite it being an office job, our boss hasn't allowed anyone to work from home. I am only a part timer and the past two weeks have been very quiet.

How should I message my boss asking if I should go in tomorrow?

On one hand, I need money. But I know that I will be somewhat ok as I will be eligible for some of the government benefits and have some savings to tie me over for a few weeks. I am also worried if this carries on for too long (ie over the few weeks) then I will actually be broke if I don't work so I should try and work now while I can.

Is going to work at a graphic design agency a valid excuse if I am asked by police?

 How concerning is the Liberal Government rushing a return to economic normality when other countires are estimating a 12-18 month slow return to normality?

 Super early access So I’ve read that to be eligible to access your super early you must have had your working hours reduced by 20% or more. 

I’ve had to take a 20% pay cut but I’m still working the same hours. Can anyone tell me if that would fall under the above as sufficient criteria to access my super?

 Is there any help for non-residents? Starting to freak out a little! I have worked as a personal trainer at a gym for 4 years, but as of yesterday I have lost my job for the foreseeable future. As a non-resident pommie, is there any help from the government I can get? Centrelink seems to be strictly for residents. Fortunately my landlord seems to be understanding for now, and I am in the process of talking to the bank to pause my car loan repayments. I am not sure how long my savings will keep me afloat though!

 How hard would it be for Australia to make n95 masks? I'm concerned that the mask mandate we here in Victoria have been given may be creating a false sense of security and indirectly doing more harm than good. Given how much money is being spent on this crisis, would it not be unreasonable to manufacture n95 masks ourselves?

 Directors of security companies should go to jail. I’ve seen a lot of blame levelled at government and low level security guards, that’s fair enough but the directors of these security companies should go to jail, they took all the gov money and didn’t train the staff (or even pay them properly). Scam artists.

 Can i get $10 grand from my super ? I've been stood down at work and been put on jobkeeper and have not been working.  Would I be eligible to claim money from my super ? Not sure if this meets the criteria.

 Cheating government super co-contribution. If you personally put $1000 in your super before the end of june the gov puts a free $500 in for you

[

You are also allowed to access your super and make a withdrawal because of COVID-19

[

Whats stopping me from putting in $500 into my super before June and then withdrawing $1000 in July once the government has put in the co-contribution?

It's as if the government doing a marshmallow test on us

 My boss is forcing us to work in yhe office. My boss is forcing us to go into the office even thought our work can be done from home ( i work in sales). I'm scared about loosing my job by refusing to go into the office. But I don't want to risk my health by going in. I am currently on Job Keeper. 

Is there anything I can do about it?

 So as a receptionist I am someone that my company thinks is ok to go to work while everyone in the office can work from home.. I guess my life is just less worthy and unless the government shuts down everything I have to go to the office and with public transportation

 Working From Home Rights I would like to know the rights in regarding to working from home. My Mum works in real estate on the Gold Coast and she can work from home 100%.   
Her boss is not interested in closing the office, but sje do not feel  comfortable being there when she can self-isolate the do the work more  proficiently from home. (I also work on the GC and my work has been closed till further notice)  
Just wanted some advice on herrights? Can she just tell them she will work from home? etc.  
Cheers!

 How many of you are working from home? The organisation I work for (government) have said they’re “looking into” flexible work options for high risk people. It seems like we should all be working from home by now, not ‘considering’ it at some point in the future for certain people. 

Being government, it’s extremely hierarchical, so my direct manager won’t contravene this. Just wondering if this is roughly normal or if most office job professions are now working from home?

 How does government debt work? I have two scenarios :
1) The government borrows money to pay workers. We pay our taxes and the government does what it does with that revenue.
2) the government borrows $60,000,000 less. We pay our taxes and the government does what it does with that revenue.

Am I missing something?
