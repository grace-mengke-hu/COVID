 Came across a growing anti-vac/anti-mask/pro conspiracy group on Facebook. Can we all join in, do not engage in debate just drop 'haha' reaction so they could see how stupid they are? There is currently a bunch of middle-aged Garys and Karens advocating for conspiracy and fake news claiming lock down is to test people's compliance, wearing mask is against their human rights and accusing Dan of killing people for not approving the use of hydroxychloroquine(?). The scary thing is they are having a lot of approval from the likes of them and it's growing exponentially.

I know engaging in a rational debate alone wouldn't work so I'm thinking can we just quietly drop 'haha' reactions on their comments to make them feel like they're talking shit and there is actually not that much approval for the bullshit they're spreading?

 Should I return to the UK now? I’m an exchange student from the UK. All of my fellow exchange students are leaving to go home this weekend due to flights starting to be cancelled and borders tightened. They don’t want to potentially get stuck here in a lockdown situation.

I wasn’t thinking of leaving until it got to the point where I absolutely had to but now that they are all leaving I am starting to consider it too. If I stay longer I have more chance of becoming sick and they way it seems to be going, the point where I absolutely half to leave, is only a few weeks to a month away anyway. 

Or should I try to stick it out until July when my course is over? But who knows what the situation will be at that point.

I guess I’m just looking for a bit of a discussion from anyone to help me make my mind up, thank you.

 Be careful around the post office I was at an Aus Post outlet today on the sth coast. One of the workers was walking around me coughing into their hands and the immediately touching items, re-arranging the shelves. Didnt try and coughing into their arm or washing their hands. 

They then coughed into their hands again before going behind the counter, touching things, touching the computer terminal. They had a bottle of hand sanitizer on the desk but didnt use it. Unfortuantly  i had to be served by them but made no contact with them. Another staff member walked in from out the back rubbing her nose also...

This is fucked with the amount of people and especially the elderly who go in there daily.

 Elimination of Covid-19 is Australia’s only viable option. In many respects, the cases in Victoria are Australia’s real first wave. Previous infections were largely confined to returning travellers who could be better isolated and quarantined. 


Now we have seen over the last few days that 20 cases, can become 50, then 190 in no time at all. We are a large country but our population is concentrated. We are a country with an abundance of natural resources. This wave is our first real test. 

I feel that, whenever there is some virus out there, there is the potential to be a lot out there, and rolling on again off again lockdowns are not in the public interest. They are going to need to be enforced more strictly because people are people, they’ll break rules in their own self interest. 

We have no idea when, if ever, a vaccine will be developed, nor any idea of its long term efficacy. We also have no idea the economic impacts of rolling shut downs. I felt the federal government’s response was good in March, however I feel that now, the “economy” is blinding the thinking far too much. This idea of “loosening” and “opening up” is great, when there is NO virus. Suppressing it and running a half baked economy with the constant fear of resurgence is not helpful. 

Elimination of Covid-19 within our borders is highly possible. Business will suffer. People will go to the wall financially, but they are going to anyway. Perhaps it is better to rip the bandaid off quicker than peel it off slowly, then reapply it, then peel it off slowly again. 

Sure, as jurisdictions are confirmed Covid free (meaning testing pretty much everyone, even asymptomatic people) they can be opened, but with heavily enforced movement control from areas that are not Covid free. Like Perth or Adelaide potentially. It feels like we’re going half baked with suppression, while the economy still suffers. Perhaps following NZ, we could try and eliminate Covid and keep our borders tightly shut until globally things improve. 

We can’t really say that we’re stopping the virus, even in Victoria under this “lockdown” which still means an individual can go to Chadstone all day, walk around the CBD and sit on a packed train, even if they live in a hotspot. It’s a half measure. As countries and cities around the world now see, Covid-19 doesn’t respond to half measures. With the recent scientific advice showing this disease is likely airborne, the bullshit 1.5 metre rule is a joke. (Not that it’s adhered to anyway) 

Perhaps we could return the economy to a war footing for 3-6 months and make a real national effort? NATIONAL, with everyone doing their bit. It CAN be done if we really WANTED to, the question is, how badly do we want to be free of Covid -19 ?

 Working from home is ruining my mental health I'm supposed to be on compassionate leave for two days as my uncle has just passed away and my grandfather also has very little time left. I cannot even see him one last time as we live in different states. However, due to the "always available" mentality people have regarding mobiles and emailing, compounded by the reality of working from home, I have literally not had a single day off for months. I feel so overwhelmed by my personal situation and just need some space to grieve and rest my mind, but I cannot get away from my job for even a few hours without someone texting me. I am in a customer-facing position which makes it even harder, because a client could easily become offended if they don't feel I've been responsive to their attempts to contact me and until this week I have been on probation.

I just need an actual break, and to have my RDOs and personal leave respected. I'm not even getting paid to work this much because I'm only on Jobkeeper now. I feel like my brain is boiling in my skull from the stress and the expectations on me. I'm lucky to have a stable full time job so I feel like I shouldn't complain, but the fact that I can't even have some uninfringed time to grieve for my uncle and grandfather's lives is very frustrating to me.

 Neighbours not masking up AND are visiting people. What do? I hate the fact that I feel like the arsehole for being annoyed about it. My neighbours and their small kids have walked past our property several times to visit their parents, down the street. Since stage 4 restrictions came into play a week ago here in Melb. No masks, and not to drop the kids for baby-sitting, which would be allowable under these restrictions.

What am I meant to do? They're being selfish and entitled. Are they just dumb, careless or wilfully ignorant? Or are they perhaps under resourced (emotionally or intellectually) and I should give them a break. Part of me is incensed that they feel they can decide for themselves that they don't need to participate in this action that everyone else is doing, for the greater good.

It'd feel like a big move to dob them in. But c'mon guys. 

Any help thinking it through would be much appreciated!

 When to self quarantine I’m actually less interested in self protection than I am worried about me or my family infecting other people. I am very comforted by the fact that children are less likely to become very ill with this but worried that they will be carriers.  

My work is ready for me to work from home and my children’s schools have said they are ready for home schooling. Just waiting now for “the official go ahead” for this to happen. 

I fear that the “go ahead” won’t occur until there is a positive diagnosis in someone either at work or school. 

Isn’t it too late then?

 Elective surgery/treatment, why is IVF being highlighted? Honestly I don't get it, I feel like the treatments that alleviate pain and improve quality of life is more important than giving financially well-off people more babies.

 Given what's going on with coronavirus in Australia, is this a reasonable request from my employer? Employer wants me to go work in NT for a few weeks. Given I would have to do 14 days gov facility quarantine before I could work there, is this trip to NT a reasonable request from my employer? 

I'm a salaried employee so there would be no additional compensation for the 24/7 I would have to spend sitting in a hotel room for 2 weeks. I'm not sure I'm comfortable with doing that.


Pre-covid, my business travel consisted of a night or two a couple of times a year in various parts of Australia.

Any thoughts would be very appreciated.

 How long will it take to produce and distribute vaccine. Lets assume a Vaccine is approved etc in December and then production starts 1st January 2021. (Muprhy said it takes a few weeks between approval and production starting.)

I am hearing that it is estimated each person needs 2 doses probably for herd immunity so let's say 50 million doses. How long do you think it will take to produce it and then distribute it to an extent where we can let people in and ease restrictions?

We are lucky to have CSL and Sequel as Aus owned companies with Aussie assets which should speed it up for us quite a bit. I have heard people say anywhere from two months to two years lol.

 Stop being a fence sitter... ... and either completely cover your face or take it all off. Don't wear your mask as a chinstrap because you're ashamed of giving a shit, and don't pull it down to talk or to hear others, you air-molecule-vibrationally-challenged dumbshits. Be a hard cunt and cover your face, or be a soft cunt and take it off. I don't care about your views, just be consistent so I know to give you a wide berth so I don't contaminate my own mask. You can't have the best of both worlds by wearing it like a fucked up face-hugging thong, even if your breath smells like a hairy Hobbit foot, suck it up and eat a mint.

Take from someone whose already gone through a lung transplant when their oxygen saturation was under 30% for several years. If you think wearing a mask makes it hard to breathe you have no idea what it's really like to be at the brink of death. I'd rather off myself than have to go through having my chest cracked open like a clamshell and going on a heart/lung bypass while they scoop out my scarred lungs like an Eldritch looking oyster again because of stupid cunts like you. That's absolutely what could happen to you or the people you care about when you act so blasé about how to wear your mask.

This release of steam is brought to you by seeing a good percentage of Woolies staff stacking fresh food with their masks covering only their fat chins, leaving their pieholes and booger caves open to suck and spread disease like the absolute madlads they wish they were. We're gonna be catching waves like Kelly Slater with this slack attitude.

 TP hoarders - Who are they? I recently read an article on Vice and I’ve provided the link at the bottom of this post.
The article included interviews with people buying TP and they were asked why they were buying it at the time.

I’d personally really like to know what type of people are “stocking up” or “hoarding” TP out of pure interest.

There is absolutely no judgement here, just a social experiment.

Please comment if you are someone who has not been panic buying.
Comment if you have been panic buying.
Comment if you personally know someone who has been only if you can answer the following points accurately on their behalf.

Questions:
1. Were you raised in an affluent suburb, a moderate suburb or lower socioeconomic suburb?

2. What is your age?
 - 18 to 30
 - 30 to 40
 - 40 to 50
 - 50 to 60
 - 60+

3. If hoarding or stockpiling applies to you, what is your reason? 
ie. concerns around self-isolation, stocking up because the panic buyers are leaving you unable to purchase goods regularly or other.

4. What is your highest level of education ie. high school, trades apprenticeship, TAFE, UNI, other.

5. Do you have a political leaning?
Ie. left, right, neutral or if you are comfortable to state more specifically, liberal, labor, greens, nationals etc.


I do not wish to see any judgement or bullying involved in this discussion. Any comments that even slightly resemble bullying will be deleted.

 Not sure what is more selfish I work a design/warehouse job on a casual basis for a business with a handful of workers. I have enough money to get by for a few months and the centerlink benefits being offered should be enough for me and my partner to live off in our small unit (especially if we can renegotiate the rent rate). 

The problem for me is that I don't know what is more selfish at the moment, working or staying at home. I feel I have two choices but either one has consequences and I'm not sure who's guidance to trust (government, healthcare experts, scientists, people on coronavirusdownunder).

1. Continuing to work and help keep the business I work for afloat. My workplace is part of the supply chain for components involved in telstra's 5G network (I don't work for Testra), I feel like communications networks may be becoming more important at this time so I should be helping work on them. But this also feels selfish because although I am 30 years old, healthy and and not at risk I am still worried about contributing to the spread of the virus. The people I work with have only ever brought up the virus to make jokes about toilet paper or complain about how it's affecting business operations and nothing has been done to reduce the risk of bringing the virus in to the work place. 

2. Stay home this week and see if the infected rates in my state (VIC) keep growing before deciding whether or not to come back to work at all. This seems selfish because my work place needs me to operate the forklift and pack while they relocate. Time is running out for them before their lease ends and this is a critical time for their survival. But I want to stay home because I couldn't live with myself if I knew played a part in the spread of this virus. I just want to stay home for the whole 6 months and study something useful online to start contributing when the threat is over. I also understand that the benefits are there for people who can not work, and clearly I can work but I just don't want to. Maybe that's taking advantage of the situation but I would only want to work if I felt safe doing it.

Thanks for reading, I'm really not sure what to do and making an ethical decision is really hard for me as I don't feel like I have anything to lose either way. (I've been unemployed before, and it was not the worst experience of my life). 

Any advice or suggestions would really help because I am loosing sleep over this.

I'd love to think that I'm overthinking it, but I'm starting to get really concerned. Not entirely sure what I'm trying to achieve in starting this post, maybe just to discuss it with people who are like me and believe this whole thing has the potential to go very, very bad.

 Victoria’s press conference/road map discussion megathread - 25 October, 2020 # Victoria: TBA

Victorian Premier, Daniel Andrews, has advised that the next 24 hours of test results from the recent outbreaks across Melbourne's north will be key in determining what kind of reopening announcement can be made today.

Andrews said there would still be an update about the next stage of lifting restrictions on Sunday, but warned people against "banking" on a "whole series of detailed announcements about opening up".

 Will I be allowed treatment? Hi all I have a question if anyone can chime in. I am a 18 year old citizen here with no recent travel history but I fear that I have developed the virus. I kinda have a lump in my throat it doesn't feel sore at all like something is stuck there, no runny nose and no fever but a weird feeling in my chest. The lump and chest thing have only come today but I have been constantly monitoring my health for the past couple days since it hiked here in Australia. The chest pain kinda feels like when you've heard bad news and your heart drops but it feels constant, like a shallow pain. I've had some issues with breathing 2 years ago before but it wasn't deemed serious and everything checked out medically. But these are like the 3 symptoms right? I cannot tell if it is or I am just constantly worrying about my health that I think I have it. Not to mention this situation has been quite stressful to juggle around school and home life. 

Anyways, I was wondering that if I did contract the virus and am developing it, would I be allowed treatment or even a test? I am hearing so much people are being turned away from tests and treatment or sent in circles of procedure that end nowhere. Also seeing/hearing that our gov isn't doing much in terms of mitigation and going BAU, it seems hopeless to even attempt to seek medical help because I feel like they will tell me to just self isolate, and wait for it to pass. Hearing that our healthcare system will also probably not be able to handle all the cases, will I most likely be left to fend for myself? Do we have to be in super critical condition to even qualify for being in the ICU or getting tested? Genuinely asking here and I am based in VIC if it's anything.

 Would this be an overreaction? I made a post last week about getting married at the end of March and being worried about leaving our kids for a few days for the honeymoon. I now have a new conern. 

I caught up with a friend last week. Her husband is Japanese and they were meant to go to Japan today for a week and a half. She's decided to stay home with their toddler, but from what I understand, he's still going. He'll only be transitioning through the airport in Tokyo and then onto an area that I believe has no recorded cases. 

I'm really nervous about him coming to the wedding. I know realistically the chance of him contracting the virus is slim, but my friend is quite nervous about him being in the house with their child when he returns - because what if, right? 

My elderly grandparents cannot make the wedding anymore - my grandfather has severe respiratory issues, so flying is already a huge issue for him, and as sad as it is I'm glad they've made the decision to stay home. If they were still coming I'd probably be more inclined to ask my friend not to bring her husband. 

Would it be a complete overreaction to discuss this with her? We've been friends for over 15 years, but I'm not super close with her husband.

 We’re at the point of losing control of the virus in Victoria. Andrews government has gone from being a leader to a soft touch When one quarter of a days positive Covid tests knowingly were not home, we have all but lost control of the Coronavirus in Victoria. That’s around 150 people who would have gone anywhere potentially whilst knowing they are infected. Disgusting behaviour is an understatement. 

What it means is that this has likely been going on for weeks with a certain amount of positive cases being out in the community. This means any space, shop, cafe, restaurant, supermarket is possible to be infected when you aggregate the sheer numbers.

This means cases are not going to go down any time soon. Right now, it is important to act. 

The next press conference where Dan pleads for the people to do the right thing is getting dry, and frustrating, when clearly this is not happening. 

Every single retail outlet other than supermarkets and pharmacies must close down. In the entire state. Anything that doesn’t directly sustain life must close. Supermarkets must be able to be re purposes so that people’s shops are staggered. We cannot defeat this virus if we keep doing what we’re doing. Pleading for certain groups to not celebrate their religious faith holidays is a joke. We need to stop pleading and start enforcing. These are not normal times. We are treating it as though back to normal is just around the corner. 

We cannot just open back up. Until this virus is gone, our world has changed. Our economy has changed. All the metrics by which we measure our lives have changed. Our society is not fit for purpose for a pandemic. Until we make it free of the virus, there is never going to be a going back to normal. 

The harder we go, the more people stay alive who don’t need to die. 

Please DO something Dan

 One set of rules for Woolworths, another for us I was at Woolies (Southport Park) today and noticed that [\*all\* self-checkout kiosks were reopened]( They've closed every second kiosk due to social distancing until now. Plastic screens have been fitted, but each kiosk has now less than 1m in between, breaching social distancing rules. I asked the staff at the self-checkout and she said because there're screens in place, social distancing restrictions don't apply. Since when can a store be exempt from the 1.5m rule when plastic screens are in place? If that's the case, all tables in restaurants can be placed side-by-side as long as there's a screen in between. Woolworths thinks different rules apply to them and show no regard for customer safety and social distancing, and would do anything to not open manned checkouts.

 How likely is it many of us have had it and not known? I had a really bad flu three weeks ago; literally couldn't get out of bed I was aching and exhausted so much. Slightly short of breath, but mostly fever, aches and sore throat. Went through two boxes of tissues the second week! Still achey with occasional sore throat three weeks later with some mucus.

Saw the GP three days after feeling awful and was told "probably just a virus, you should feel right in a few days" but indeed it took until yesterday (from the 28th Feb) to feel close to "right".

Got an appointment with the GP tomorrow that I may or may not keep; to be honest, I don't fancy sitting in a waiting room right now and I am feeling lots better, if not 100%. Also, there are likely people in greater need of a doctor than me right now.

But it got me thinking... what if I had more than the flu? Would I have known?

Thing is, my two family members - one my age and one elderly - both got sick too, but the elderly one only very minor (she honestly *never* gets colds or flus, maybe cos she's on lots of meds daily?). My brother got it bad (but not as bad as me). Surely they'd have been worse if it was more than a flu?

Mum, meanwhile, is still coughing and spluttering when I spoke to her yesterday, and has been since a week after I got ill.

Just something I was wondering today. In some ways, I hope I *did* have it and got over it, but I suspect that's unlikely. My worry obviously is if I didn't, my immune system is a bit fucked up still...

But the community transmission issue made me think about this. How many could have realistically got covid-19 and not known because their symptoms weren't worse than a bad flu?

 What if someone in VIC got a stage 4 fine then went back to their home state? When I was homeless and sleeping on trains in NSW I got a few no-ticket fines but heard no more about them after going to another state.  Though this is obviously more serious, but you hear about people escaping the law by going to another state all the time.

I don't mean not wearing a mask but e.g staying at an airbnb or hotel, and traveling outside the 5km from that location.  If you don't have proof of address in vic, how on earth can the police determine your temporary address unless you're a poor liar?

Note I don't want to do any of this but I'd definitely take advantage of the vic goverment pleading for tourists once stage 4 is lifted.

* [Bitter harvest for China’s farmers as coronavirus keeps country in lockdown](

Point is, Europe, the USA and China are major food producers, and their agricultural sectors are have slowed down severely due to the pandemic.

 Anybody else extremely scared of schools completely reopening so quickly? It seems pretty crazy to me that schools are opening so soon for all students. I can understand for VCE students but the thought of thousands of kids returning to single schools really terrifies me. 

We're only 2 months away until schools will be closed for the year anyways. Can't we just cut our losses and accept school's over for the year instead of rushing and putting everything at risk? If parents are complaining about kids being home, what are they going to do from December to February when they're home for school holidays?

I don't want to be dooming or anything but I'd rather see closed just shut off so we can ensure they will be back for good in 2021 with no disruptions.

 What is the 'dangerous misinformation' that is stopping Melburnians getting tested for COVID-19? So some people still fall into that trap of _I saw it on the internet so it must be true._ Should those that refuse testing due to pure ignorance and stupidty be locked up for 2-3weeks?

&gt;Some Australians have been sharing social media posts saying there is no COVID-19 pandemic and test kits are "contaminated"....sounded the alarm that "dangerous misinformation" is stopping people from getting tested for the virus.
&gt;On Friday, the state's Health Minister Jenny Mikakos said more than 10,000 people had rejected tests since the blitz began last week with **"some people believing that coronavirus is a conspiracy or that it won't impact them".**...
&gt;It said there were "unreliable and contaminated test kits [and] ridiculously inflated death counts" with the real agenda being "enslav[ing] humanity with forced vaccines, microchips, and police state surveillance". Facebook has marked the post as "false information".

 Shut the schools! As a special needs educator I can't tell you how stressed and anxious we all are when we go to work. Our students have no sense of hygiene and we don't have enough soap to go around the school. We are spat on, deliver personal care multiple times a day, parents are allowed to walk around the school and into our classrooms freely yet we've been told we're "overreacting". We have sick staff members who are continuing to come to work as they don't have any sick leave left and are unable to get by using unpaid leave as we've been instructed. We have a right to be scared and sending us an email once a week saying thanks for the hard work isn't making us feel anything but angry and unappreciated. Parents have told us they aren't worried about the virus but just don't want to be stuck at home with their children for 14 days. WE ARE NOT BABYSITTERS. Please keep your children home!

 Why the flying duck are we spending billions when we only need about $40 million to give everyone a mask, and enforce a mandatory mask law? Are all the world governments this obtuse? The US is spending over a trillion dollars because of the shitstorm corona has caused, when we could've all at the start of the outbreak handed out masks en masse to infected states.

And we'd rather spend several billion in bailouts for the lockdown instead of a few million to get the masks, even pay people to deliver them door to door, not just have them collected. 

For $40 million give or take. What happened to the Spanish flu governance? When Australia had mandatory mask laws? Are we all pansies that can't stand the thought of putting on a piece of cloth so others don't die? We could've avoided lockdown altogether if we stopped airborne transmissions (primary method of transmission by the way, the worlds governments are actually braindead). Social distancing and shit are next to useless without masks. I could sneeze once and a quarter of my local woolies would be Chernobyl code red

 Hospitals are going to be completely fucked when most staff are either home sick, or passing it on to patients. I'd say within a week or two. My friend who's a nurse just told me she's sick and was in the **same room with a confirmed case**. The "staff clinic" our hospital set up refuses to test her.  As well, hospitals are telling staff NOT to wear N95 masks.  This is the kind of thing that is causing this to be so bad -  Terrible Government guidelines based on lack of test kits and lack of PPE. None of it is based on science. Hospitals just have to comply.

Other countries had similarly weak response at the start, and it's only when they start implementing extreme infection control measures that new cases start to slow down.  This WILL increase massively very soon because the government is utterly useless. They only allow testing of people from overseas, like WTF it's already confirmed to be spreading within Australia. Buy more fucking test kits and PPE!

 Boss Doesn't Believe in Coronavirus Crisis So. The job I have currently is very doable from home. Obviously being in the office is preferable for my employer under normal conditions, but I mostly just work off my laptop which I can do anywhere.

I stayed home the past few days because I had a cough and wanted to abide by responsible self-quarantine recommendations. But because my job can easily be done from home 99% of the time, I requested to continue working from home while we're all trying to flatten the curve.

Unfortunately, I cannot, NOT because I have a job that requires my physical presence, but because my boss just doesn't believe any of this is a big deal. He thinks everyone is overreacting and still thinks the flu is worse.

He thinks the chances of catching it are statistically miniscule, and that China and South Korea and Singapore have already peaked and are recovering, and we will too, and this whole thing will be over by approximately June.

And in the meantime, we should all just go to work like normal. With some extra handwashing and distancing within the office, I guess. So I have to go back tomorrow.

What is especially stupid about this is that while I am in my mid-30s with no underlying health issues, he is in his late 60s, very prone to illness and infection, with a history of heart problems and respiratory problems. The last time he got really sick it knocked him out for more than a year!

It seems completely absurd to keep going to the office when I don't really need to, especially considering my boss is super high-risk. He could also easily work from home but again, just doesn't believe there is anything to worry about.

He thinks he is smarter than all of these doctors and health professionals, and it just infuriates me because I want to do the right thing here and minimise spread as much as possible.

I know not everyone has the ability to work from home - which is why it seems all the more important that the people who can stay home, actually do. The fewer people out and about, the slower it spreads.

I just fear there are a lot of other people like my boss in total denial and they are going to be the reason more people die.

 This subreddit is becoming overly politically divisive and seemingly full of trolls. Don't let this ruin all the great news, stats, analysis and facts being presented here. Don't get me wrong - political discussion is extremely important as we discuss handling of the pandemic, border closures, restrictions etc.

However, this subreddit has taken a turn. 

Almost every thread is now full of people posting propaganda about ANDREWS FANBOYZ, DICTATOR DAN, DHHS IS THE WORST DEPARTMENT IN THE WORLD, SCOMO SUCKS etc.

Every time the PM or mainstream media makes a comment, the subreddit gets flooded with trash takes.

There's also a lot of people posting deliberately inflammatory comments trying to stoke tensions between states. 

I really think this needs to be addressed. This subreddit is too good to be ruined like this - there is so much fantastic information, analaysis and graphs. I personally benefit greatly from it. 

But the genuine propaganda is really starting to get draining and I'm finding myself not wanting to enter this subreddit as much.

 JobKeeper is half-baked Fair enough the purpose is noble and justified. The execution is poor and there are grey areas everywhere - if you think JobKeeper isn't fucked because of this, you're more concerned about your own bottom line and not the bigger picture.

Employees with a sense of entitlement bigger than the stick up their ass are everything wrong with this country.

Honestly, why don't we show some more bloody respect for employers...

 Did Western Australia shut down too early? I am in a regional area of WA, in my LGA there have been 2 cases only, 9 in the whole region, they are presumably in quarantine, that number has not changed for quite a while, we have regional lock downs in place so no new cases can be brought into the region. I feel like our lock down is going to be extended indefinitely, because we wont reach the cases required for herd immunity.   
I definitely feel like approaches relevant in NSW are not necessarily a good idea in WA. What are everyone else thoughts?

 Panic buying defeating social distance It’s concerning that, aside from advice to ‘hire a caterer’, neither state nor federal governments appear to be doing anything to stem the current panic-buying fervour that we’ve seen pretty-much everywhere. Where are the statements that, as a nation of primary producers, we have plenty of food and there’s no need to hoard fresh items? Where are the press conferences in front of supermarket distribution centres showing that they have plenty of stock and that the issue is merely getting this to supermarkets? Where are the reassurances that, even in a lock-down, people will be permitted to visit their local supermarket to stock up, and that no-one will be locked starving in their own home?

The bigger concern with this is that as we see bare supermarket shelves, and as people have to visit four or five supermarkets to find essentials, the virus is more likely to spread. As supermarkets become more crowded, maintaining an appropriate social distance is less possible. Add into this the very real issue of minibuses full of morons driving around to multiple regional supermarkets to strip them of stock. Not only is this unconscionable behaviour in its own right, but there is every likelihood that these actions increases the risk of the spread of disease into new communities. 

Supermarket-imposed purchase limits haven’t really worked. Should the next step be to limit access to supermarkets based on home address postcode? Police presence at supermarkets to enforce limits? Formal rationing? If this isn’t addressed in some way, even the people who are otherwise taking this seriously and being careful are likely to be unwittingly spreading the virus just because they need to feed their families.

 I'm scared lockdown will push me to suicide. Hello mates,

I usually lurk and am not a regular reddit poster, so please bear with me. I know that the current situation is stressful for everyone, but the thought of going into lockdown is making me legitimately anxious about my mental health.

I am a person with pretty severe anxiety, BPD and PTSD who has been going through a pretty rough patch in the last few months. I am usually something of a homebody, so the whole "stay at home" thing for me has, so far, been pretty easy. I rarely go anywhere, I have a job that allowed me to work from home even before this pandemic, and I have a very small social life. That said, I do have one or two close friends that I see maybe once or twice a month, and these visits (we usually hang out at one of our homes, stay up all night and play video games/chat) are something that helps keep my mood stable. Basically, these long time friends are my support network, and they've taken to visiting me at least once a month, just to provide a sense of stability and help me cope with day to day life.

Yesterday, when talking to a coworker of mine about a possible impending hard lockdown, I expressed that I was worried how I would cope with complete isolation, and I was informed that wanting to hang out with my friends was selfish, and that my mental health is not as important as protecting the community.

Now I am feeling legitimately afraid. Being cut off from the people who support me, I'm not sure how I will cope being completely alone and now I am feeling like a terrible human being because I am placing my own needs above those of my fellow Australians.

Am I wrong to feel this way? And what are some ways to keep my mental health in check as we buckle down to weather this thing?

 r/CoronavirusAustralia is looking for additional moderators Hi everyone,

This community has grown to over 1k members and it is a good time to get more moderators on board.

If you're interested please send a modmail with some information about yourself and why you think you'd be good to be a mod here.

I won't be able to accept all applications, but even if you won't make it now, I'll keep you in mind for the future.

Currently the sub requires very little moderation, it is, relatively speaking, a very small subreddit. However, it is very active, with a large proportion of users online at any time, hoping to get information and updates on the situation at hand. Therefore I'm seeking users who are able to maintain a mostly hands-off approach to help strike a balance between openness of information / expression and civility and usability of the sub, if that makes sense. The ability to hold back your personal views or politics is pretty important too. If you're willing to post news links and updates that's a bonus (not required though).

Thank you for reading and your interest!

 Elimination strategy still an option: Sutton A national “elimination” strategy for COVID-19 is not off the table - especially if cases continue to rise in New South Wales, says Victoria’s Chief Health Officer.

Speaking on ABC Radio Melbourne’s Drive program, Professor Brett Sutton said the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) had done “some really detailed thinking” about elimination, but that it was up to politicians to make the call.

“It's certainly for politicians to consider because it has profound implications for tourism, for travel and for how you manage locking your country down, because elimination requires that you don't have any virus introduced through any mechanism,” he said.

Professor Sutton said an elimination strategy would entail even harder locked-down borders, all but for the most essential travel.

“So that's for Home Affairs, border security and our tourism and education industries to particularly consider the economic and social implications”.Asked if he believed there was any appetite for a suppression strategy, Professor Sutton said he did not think it was “out of the question”.

“Especially if we see significant transmission that occurs now in New South Wales - I absolutely hope it doesn't - but if we see this kind of see-sawing of having to manage really substantial outbreaks we’ll all reflect on the fact that it's going to be really, really hard to sustain this seesawing [with], as you know, pretty damaging economically, socially, psychologically shut downs and if there is an alternative that is less harmful,” he said.

“Because it's all bad, in the grand scheme of things, but if we can find the least harmful pathway and elimination might be that one and we can do it then I hope it's there on the radar for everyone”.

 Deaths due to lockdowns I'm starting to think that these lockdowns aren't such a great idea. 

What about the deaths by cancer that will occur due to the reallocation of funding and facilities?

What about the excess number of people who will die from other diseases, because funding for the treatment of those diseases will decrease as the economy tanks?

What about the future lives that will be lost due to the fact that scientific advancement will be halted as the result of a failing economy and the ensuing lack of funding? Solutions to problems that might have saved thousands of lives will now not be discovered, or implemented, because there will be less scientific research going on in general.

What about the 130 million extra people in the third world who are going die of starvation now due to famines caused by lockdowns (source: 

What about the fact that the loss the meaning and hope in people's lives will push them to political extremes, as in pre-WW2 Germany?

What about the fact that recession leads to depression, which can lead to war (in which case millions of young people may die)?

It's starting to seem like a really horrible idea. And if this is the case, we're forfeiting our liberty only to see more people die anyway.

 Who is actually being tested in Australia? Positive test results within Australia seem low compared with many other countries, but it seems that stats about confirmed cases are only really meaningful with the context of how many people are being tested here.  


Is it all people arriving from countries thought to be high risk? All people arriving from those countries and showing symptoms? All people showing symptoms, regardless of whether they've travelled or not? And once a case is established, how widely are tests done around that person? Just people they live with? People they've spent some time with? All people they've come into contact with?

 Why have people "relaxed" so much? Since restrictions have been eased (outside of Vic), many people I know are going around hugging and shaking hands as though the virus does not exist. These are the same people who were extremely cautious during the lockdown phase and often criticized the gov. for not doing enough to contain the spread. It's almost as though a switch has been flicked in people's heads.

I don't buy the "people are idiots" argument anymore, as the people I'm referring to are generally sensible people.  What on earth is going on? I feel like we're entering a dangerous new phase.

 My housemate wants to return to work at a primary school &amp; also a childcare centre. I feel hugely concerned about contracting COVID (we all are, but I'm asthmatic &amp; have had severe pneumonia in the past) I'm really not sure what to do... my other housemate is fine with her returning to work, and isn't going to 'socially distance' from her in our home, so I feel like my options are to self-isolate in my bedroom... or don't live in my home? I feel its important to note that my housemate is currently not struggling to pay rent etc. and has financial support outside of these workplaces.

I'm trying to be calm and measured, but unsure if there is a way for me to feel safe while she is working in what I consider to be 2 fairly high-risk environments.

It looks like in places (eg Hokkaido) where they reopened schools, they had a spike in infections and had to close them again... not sure why Aus is going to be different, but my housemates are being 'optimistic' about this so I'm not sure how to get through to them.
