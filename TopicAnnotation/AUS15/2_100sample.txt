 Why not make a “testing day” for everyone in Melbourne and Mitchell Shire? Like Election Day, where voting is mandatory, why can’t we have a COVID testing day, where getting tested for COVID-19 is mandatory if you live in Melbourne or Mitchell shire? We can have testing centres via drive-thru, schools, church halls, community centres, halls, clinics, mobile testing, hospitals etc?

&amp;#x200B;

Why not make testing day the 1st August 2020, and everyone residing in Melbourne and Mitchell Shire will have to get tested for COVID-19 despite whatever that have done before, whether they have received a negative or positive result, or already isolating/quarantining.

And of course, very heavy fines for refusing?

 Papua New Guinea records 55 new cases 

- 55 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in PNG, bringing the total to 287

- The single highest recorded in a day, 18 from the National Capital District and 37 from Western Province.

- Over 11,920 persons have been tested for COVID-19
287 have returned positive including 78 persons who have fully recovered and 209 active cases.

Cases | District
--:|:--
206 | National Capital District

Notes: 

- We note the discrepancy in the totals and will update when clarified.
- Developments in Papua New Guinea and other close neighbors (eg. NZ, Fiji) are deemed relevant to CoronavirusDownunder due to the extensive connections, travel and supply routes and large numbers of Australians living in PNG and visa versa.  Increasing spread in our immediate neighbors will inevitably impact Australia, so when there are substantial developments in neighboring regions we will post regular updates.

 Call to free prisoners to prevent jail outbreak. More than 370 lawyers, academics and other legal experts have signed a letter calling for the early release of elderly, young and minor offenders due to the risk of an “uncontrollable” coronavirus outbreak in Australian prisons  

More than 370 lawyers, academics and other legal experts have signed a letter calling for the early release of elderly, young and minor offenders due to the risk of an “uncontrollable” coronavirus outbreak in Australian prisons and youth detention centres.

The open letter to state and territory governments calls for urgent reforms to protect the prison population, warning it is a matter of time before an outbreak in jails that would flow on to the general population.

It was co-ordinated by Professor Thalia Anthony from the University of Technology Sydney and Professor Lorana Bartels from The Australian National University.

“We the undersigned are seeking your immediate action to reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19 in the Australian criminal justice system, especially prisons and youth detention centres,” the letter states.

“We know that COVID-19 spreads quickly in closed spaces and prisons are commonly epicentres for infectious diseases.

“This is particularly a concern where there is overcrowding, with most Australian prisons operating at over 100 per cent of their design capacity.

“The World Health Organisation (WHO) has identified overcrowding as a structural problem that contributes to the spread of infections in prisons.”

 

The letter warns that many incarcerated people also have chronic conditions, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and asthma, making them vulnerable to more severe forms of COVID-19

“Research on other diseases, such as tuberculosis (TB) and hepatitis, shows rates of infection among incarcerated populations are up to 100 times higher than outside of prisons. “It is only a matter of time before COVID-19 breaks out in our prisons and youth detention centres. This will then have a substantial flow-on effect to the community, including community health services.

“People are continually churning in and out of prisons and then being released to their communities. Significantly, 77 per cent of people entering and 33 per cent of people in prison are unsentenced and 30 per cent of sentenced prisoners are expected to serve less than 12 months.

“Failing to deal with COVID-19 in the criminal justice system will also have a disproportionate effect on vulnerable populations over-represented in prisons, namely Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples; people from low socio-economic backgrounds; people experiencing homelessness; and people with disabilities.”

International measures had included Iran’s release of 85,000 prisoners, Ireland’s proposal to release prisoners with less than 12 months to serve and the proposed release of high-risk inmates from Rikers Island and elsewhere in the US and Britain.

The letter calls for Australian governments to urgently:

● Ensure prisoners are informed on the status of COVID-19 and their rights;

● Support bail and non-custodial penalties for all defendants who do not present a very high risk that cannot be managed in the community (for example, through electronic monitoring), noting that stringent restrictions on daily movement are likely in any event;

● Legislate to require bail and sentencing courts to consider the risk that the pandemic will present to the prisoner and their community upon release, with a view to promoting community-based options;

● Facilitate remote supervision of bail and community corrections;

● Provide additional support to victims, noting the likely increased risk of family violence for those in home quarantine conditions.

 The Victorian models are overly pessimistic - UPDATE A quick update on [the model that I recently submitted]( As predicted, Victorians in lock down ARE doing the right thing and exceeding government modelling expectations. 

It appears that my model is performing well. It slightly over-estimated the reduction in the infections. However it is well within reasonable bounds. [I predicted that there would be 267 diagnoses, but there were actually 296 diagnoses]( (once duplicates, false positives and other re-classifications occur). To be only 10% out is a pretty good estimate. 

By comparison, the government model [expects there to be an average of 63 cases per day over the trailing 14 day period on September 17th]( (3rd-17th), however 3rd-14th already has an average of only 49 cases per day, and over-estimate of 29% and those predictions will get worse. Government modelling is yet again overly pessimistic about the efficacy of the lockdown. You can read their model results here: [

Time is the key for this difference in predictions. There is a delay between exposure and testing, and this is hard to capture in models. It means the models incorrectly predict a longer time needed to approach zero infections. I also predicted this same effect in April, arguing for lockdowns to be maintained to see us to near-zero cases. You can read that paper [here](

The good news is that the good thing that I predicted has come true. Keep up the good work Victoria, we're thinking of you and want you out of lockdown soon!

**Mt Roskill Evangelical Fellowship Cluster**

This new sub-cluster has come about as a result of a contact of a case having close contact with other people.

As far as we can tell they were unaware they had been infected and were incubating and spreading the virus at the time.

By 8am today, labs had registered new tests for 64% of the congregation (213 of the 332 people).

There are 101 close contacts associated with this sub-cluster.

**St Dominics**

The school deep clean at St Dominic’s has been completed and testing of all staff and students is well underway.

Many members of the school community have been tested since they were informed of the case on Tuesday afternoon.

Staff and students have been provided with access to two dedicated testing centres not open to the general public. This means they can be tested without long waits and the results can be processed as quickly as possible – tests from these sites are prioritised at laboratories.

**Misinformation**

Repeated deliberate spreading of misinformation is threatening to block our path to Level 1.

We are seeing coordinated campaigning, designed to confuse and sow doubt, everyone has the right to their own views, but everyone also has a right to be safe.

So please think twice before sharing or passing on something you cant verify.

We can all play our part in drowning out misinformation by sharing the right information.

 Some perspective for all these pro-lockdowners On July 30th, Victoria reported 723 cases. 

NSW, with a bigger population, had fewer cases than that since July 30th, *in total*. 

Yet NSW never went into lockdown. Businesses stayed open. Schools stayed open. People weren't put on a curfew. Families weren't kept apart. 

What NSW did was to mass test, tightly manage its hotel quarantine, and *very rapidly* trace and isolate the contacts of identified cases and inform the community. It is what every *competent* government does to manage Covid-19. 

Sure, such behind-the-scenes contact tracing work is boring. It does not let a politician wag their finger at people for doing the wrong thing. It does not allow them the power trip to put millions of adults practically into house arrest. But it is what keeps the streets open, communities functioning and families together. 

Now, as we finally move forward, remember to look back and see what we suffered - yet which noone else in Australia had to suffer. Not because they are naturally immune to Covid or anything. Only because their government bothered to do the "boring" stuff, rather than just empty chest thumping at a presser. 

And do not let people who think lockdowns are the only way to manage Covid ever make you forget this. Their choices prevented you from living these past few months normally, like everyone else in Australia did.

 Mystery Cases Data So if you go to the DHHS PowerBI dashboard, you can click on each day in the graph and it shows the updated split of acquisition. AFAIK there's no other source of this data, and they only report the daily aggregate additions to unknown transmission, which doesn't give much info on the trend of community transmission over time. So I wrote a scraper to get the data myself! Unlike the data reported on Covid Live, this data actually links the community transmission cases back to the day they were diagnosed.  


This chart shows the proportion of cases on each day which have been classed as Unknown Source. Because there's still large numbers of cases under investigation, I also plotted the proportion of new cases which are either unknown or under investigation. This essentially gives an "upper bound" on the unknown source cases. As you can see, the vast majority of cases have been classified up until about 8-9 days ago, where the backlog of cases under investigation is still large.  


Community transmission is definitely trending downward as a proportion of new cases, but it seems it might have stabilized at around 20-25% in late July. Hopefully Stage 4 drives this down more.  


I'll be updating this data each day and if there's interest, I'll share here again!

 Why are they ONLY asking Health and Aged care workers to not work? So the government is telling Health and Aged care workers not to go to work for 14 days if they have recently returned from Italy or South Korea.

What am I missing? This makes no sense to me!! So... the other travellers can go around as they please, spreading it to others - including Health and Aged care workers!

What sort of containment plan is that?

 Are we rationing screening in Australia?  I work as a nurse in Australia in one of the major metropolitan hospitals which is supposed to be opening up a Covid-19 screening clinic. I work in a ward with a suspected case and they are not doing an extended PCR screening to confirm whether it's coronavirus because "it's expensive" as per the head nurse... The patient has tested negative for flu but continues to have flu like symptoms. So, it seems like we're rationing screening.

 8 additional cases in NSW bringing NSW total to 56 An additional eight cases of COVID-19 have been diagnosed as at 7am today bringing the total number of confirmed cases in NSW to 55.

These figures refer to people who are in NSW and have been investigated for or have been diagnosed with novel coronavirus (COVID -19).

The new cases include:

- A woman in her 20s , a known contact of a previously confirmed case at Ryde Hospital
- a woman in her 40s who recently returned from South Korea
- a male in his 20s, a Victorian resident who recently returned from Hong Kong. He is included in the Victorian case count.

NSW Health is also following up three other cases; a woman in her 30s, a male in his 70s and a woman in her 40s to identify the source of their infection and trace their close contacts.

- A woman in her 80s who transferred from Dorothy Henderson Lodge Aged Care Facility to Ryde Hospital.

- A woman in her 40s who is related to a deceased resident from Dorothy Henderson Lodge Aged Care Facility.

Following confirmation of three cases at St Patrick’s Marist College, Dundas and Willoughby Girls High School, NSW Health is contacting close contacts of the three children to advise them to self-isolate and seek medical advice if they become unwell.

NSW Health is continuing to find and respond to cases as they are diagnosed to slow any spread of COVID-19 in the community.

The NT case is also being included in the NSW count as he is a Sydney resident.

 NSW Health: Public health alert - new venues 28 October 2020

NSW Health is alerting the public that a confirmed case of COVID-19, who will be included in tomorrow’s numbers, has attended venues in Sydney’s south-west and east.

Anyone who attended the following venues for at least an hour at these times is considered a close contact and must get tested immediately and isolate for a full 14 days from exposure regardless of the result:

* Flip Out Prestons Indoor Trampoline Park, Unit B/238 Hoxton Park Road, Prestons on Sunday 25 October 2020, between 12pm – 1.50pm
* Jasmins Lebanese Restaurant, 375 Macquarie Street, Liverpool, on Sunday 25 October 2020, between 2pm – 3.30pm

Anyone who attended the following venues is considered a casual contact and must monitor for symptoms and get tested immediately if they develop. After testing, they must remain in isolation until a negative test result is received:

* Westfield Bondi Junction, 500 Oxford Street, Bondi Junction, Saturday 24 October 2020, between 1.30pm – 4.30pm 
* Watsup Brothers kebab shop, 149 Eldridge Road, Condell Park, on Saturday 24 October 2020, between 5.30pm – 6pm 
* Ali Baba Charcoal Chicken, 2 Civic Road, Auburn, on Monday 26 October 2020, between 1pm – 1.20pm Carnes Hill
* Marketplace, Kurrajong Road, Carnes Hill, on Tuesday 27 October 2020, between 3.30pm – 4.30pm,/li&gt;

Testing numbers have dropped recently, which is a concern. NSW Health is appealing to the community to come forward for testing right away if you have even the mildest of symptoms like a runny nose or scratchy throat, cough, fever or other symptoms that could be COVID-19.

There are over 300 COVID-19 testing locations across NSW. To find your nearest clinic visit [COVID-19 testing clinics​](

 Rural communities and agriculture are suffering from hard border closures. &gt;[abc.net.au/news/2020-08-19/pinnaroo-murrayville-community-to-struggle-under-restrictions/12570152?fbclid=IwAR0Jk9-Dxd1T3v4q2s1y3fShkIZTdtAYE\_NCQuwMCB-oacHeZi42asgHV28](  
&gt;  
&gt;The border closure with SA will leave Pinnaroo without GP, physiotherapy, podiatry, skin cancer, diabetes and mental health services.

**Moreover, from ABC South East SA:**

&gt;The loss of Western Victorian nursing staff at the Naracoorte Hospital from tonight is expected to impact after-hours emergency theatre services, including obstetrics.  
&gt;  
&gt;Kincraig Medical Clinic's doctor Jeff Taylor said tighter border restrictions meant some nurses and a radiographer will no longer be able to cross from their homes in Western Victoria for work at Naracoorte.  
&gt;  
&gt;“These nurses and radiographers provide an essential service during working hours and also after-hours on the emergency roster, and without them it puts a huge strain on the remaining members of our on-call team,” Dr Taylor said..  
&gt;  
&gt;He says staff are currently performing extra shifts for the Naracoorte COVID-19 clinic.  
&gt;  
&gt;“With taking two of our theatre nurses off the roster, we go from seven down to five,” Dr Taylor said.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Now you can only ask those members of staff - we need three on call each night - they can only be on call for so long before they get exhausted.   
&gt;  
&gt;“If they're not able to be on the roster, then we're not able to provide after-hours emergency theatre services.”  
&gt;  
&gt;He said this would impact on after-hours obstetric services, and women in labour would be transferred to the Mount Gambier Hospital.  
&gt;  
&gt;He said the consequences of the border closure on the hospital were “quite disheartening”.
