 Australian Defense Force ramping up virus support  The government is ramping up the use of Defence personnel to help manage the national coronavirus crisis.

ADF teams will support state and territory health authorities with contact tracing of positive COVID-19 cases, with the first deploying to NSW on Sunday to assist overwhelmed officials.

ADF reconnaissance, planning and support teams have also been embedded in the Victorian, Queensland, Northern Territory and Western Australian state coordination centres, with additional teams ready to assist remaining states and territories.

Defence Minister Linda Reynolds said the teams would support the overall strength and resilience of the Australian health system as it came under unprecedented pressure.

“These ADF teams will provide logistics, transport, health and general planning assistance as the workload of civilian medical teams continues to increase as more Australians are diagnosed with, or affected by, COVID-19,” Senator Reynolds said.

“Defence continues to follow the advice of Australian health authorities when prioritising its support arrangements.”

Scott Morrison said on Sunday the ADF could also support supermarkets with grocery deliveries.

“All of those options are available in what’s called the national coordinating mechanism. That’s where the Department of Home Affairs is working with the food suppliers, with the supermarkets,” he told the ABC.

“It’s important that we provide that support and we’re there to help and the defence forces are turning up now just like they were during the bushfires. But it’s a very different need.”

 Why accessing your super to cushion blow of coronavirus might not be the best idea  

We live in extraordinary times and that calls for extraordinary measures. The stakes are high and the costs will be even higher.

Given the nature and scale of this unprecedented COVID-19 crisis, it seems churlish to nit-pick any of the significant measures aimed at "cushioning the blow" of the enormous economic impacts we face.

But that does not mean that any decisions that we could ultimately regret should go unchallenged.

The move to grant early access to superannuation balances of up to $10,000 this financial year, and the same again next, for those in financial stress sits uneasily with me, although I recognise that my views — like the landscape before us — could alter radically in coming months

Indeed, I have consistently argued against early access to super as a means of helping first home buyers into the market, as some were suggesting just a couple of years ago.

The amount — $10,000 — does not sound like that much, especially if it will help you through a crisis. But this is where thinking is flawed.

## Everyone's super has taken a battering

It will be the younger among us, along with those already on low incomes, who would be most expected to access their super in the year or two ahead, as they are far less likely to have access to other savings.

For a person who is say, 35, who loses their job in the coming weeks, that $10,000 today will be worth just over $65,000 when they eventually retire in another 35 years.

And that's based on the average 5.5 per cent return of conservative funds for the past 15 years — including the period of the global financial crisis.

In a higher-risk-higher-return portfolio rate, where we'd expect most younger people to be, that figure is closer to $130,000 (such is the beauty of compound interest).

Given recent sharp falls in equity and other asset markets — with more likely on the way before this is over — everyone's super balance, whether young or old, wealthy or not, has already taken a battering in recent weeks. We can hardly afford to compromise these further.

 A sudden, unplanned increase in fund redemptions when financial markets are already fragile will also likely have the effect of adding further downward pressure on the value of balances. However, the decision to allow reduced drawdowns by retirees — halved from 4 per cent to 2 per cen — is sensible and could ameliorate in part some of the negative effects. 

## The government is responsible for the economy's health

We cannot and should not condemn a significant part of a generation and income demographic to an unnecessary retirement on struggle street.

Even if we put the maths to the side, we are told to expect the next six months at least to be tough. Will $10,000 make enough of an impact now to be worth that sacrifice of future comfort?

Some might argue "yes, every little bit helps". In fact, this could be taken as a good example of what economists call "lifetime income smoothing", when we use savings or borrowing to pay for those large (and sometimes unforeseen) life events — a wedding, university education, or illness.

But our super system has been carefully crafted with the specific aim of improving our economic circumstances in our increasingly long retirements and that requires preserving those payments.

However, even putting these arguments about the future cost of such a decision, I would argue that the main reason not to proceed on this path is because it is abrogating responsibility from the Federal Government.

Even in the conservative UK under Boris Johnston, there is a recognition that doing "whatever it takes" to support the health system and the economy is the responsibility of government.

People will play a crucial role in this crisis, to be sure. But they should not be asked to sacrifice some of their future retirements. Not yet.

 Gumtree bans toilet paper, hand sanitiser listings  

Online marketplace Gumtree will ban all listings for toilet paper, hand sanitiser and other sought-after goods - which have been advertised for sale at heavily marked-up prices.

A day after Home Affairs minister Peter Dutton vowed to go after hoarders buying up goods to sell overseas or on the “black market”, Gumtree announced the temporary ban and a change of its policies. 

“As a community marketplace, demonstrating respect and sensitivity to our users is of huge importance to us,” Gumtree said in a statement.

“To curb pricing practices that run counter to the community-minded spirit of Gumtree, from Friday 20 March, Gumtree will temporarily ban listings for health care masks, including N95/N100 and surgical masks, hand sanitiser/gel, disinfecting wipes and toilet paper.

“Gumtree operates a report and take down process and we encourage users to use the ‘Report Ad’ function to flag any concerning ads that breach our policies, terms of use, or believed to be unlawful.”

 Casual employees infected or quarantined over the coronavirus will be able to immediately access welfare payments (but won't be granted special paid leave)  

Casual employees infected or quarantined over the coronavirus will be able to immediately access welfare payments but won't be granted special paid leave.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced on Thursday that the government would waive waiting periods for casuals to access existing sickness payments under the [welfare system]( to compensate them for lack of work from the coronavirus. 

The sickness [subsidy]( rebadged as the job seeker payment, is a Newstart level payment and will still be asset tested.

The prime minister did not respond to unions' demands for the government to grant two-weeks' paid leave for casuals and contractors, who do not otherwise have access to paid sick leave, during the period of the virus.

"People who are casual employees that wouldn't be able to go to work or because they have to self-isolate or, indeed, have the virus, they would be able to access that payment," Mr Morrison told reporters. 

"The normal assets test rules apply to those as they do to all these payments, but the waiting period will be waived to enable them to access that payment and that will provide that support. Many other countries don't have that in the system."

Australian Council of Trade Unions secretary Sally McManus slammed the proposal as not enough to stop exposed employees from showing up to work.

"Scott Morrison's proposal for casuals workers to access $40/day allowance fails the test to remove the financial penalty for workers to self-isolate," she said.

"This means many people will work. We must do everything to contain the virus to slave lives"

She said "two weeks paid special leave for all workers who may need it during this crisis is vital".

The government also announced it will pay half the wages of 117,000 apprentices and trainees, or up to $7000 a quarter, for a nine month period, backdated to January, to ensure they don't lose their job due to the coronavirus. The subsidy will cover electricians, plumbers, chefs, and childcare and aged care trainees.

Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry director of employment and training, Jenny Lambert, said the apprenticeship subsidy had been a "top priority" for employers.

"Some trades rely on apprentices to get licenced trades people," she said. "If that stopped then the pipeline could really impact future growth."

The apprentice subsidy is expected to be worth around $1.3 billion across 2019-20 and 2020-21 and is open to employers of all sizes, as well as group training organisations that re-engage an eligible out-of-trade apprentice or trainee.

The broad eligibility is designed to encourage larger businesses to pick up employees who have had to be let go by smaller businesses due to the strain on the economy.

Australian Industry Group chief executive Innes Willox also welcomed the announcement of a service to find new employers for displaced apprentices.

"The sooner an apprentice returns to work and skills training the better the outcomes for all involved. The national Apprentice Employment Network is ideally placed to deliver this service."

 An analogy that I've been working on re: tinfoilers vs the disaffected I was called out recently for calling people who are protesting the lockdown measures "tinfoilers". It wasn't exactly what I meant but that's how it was interpreted so I've been looking for a good way to describe it. This is what I've come up with.

&amp;#x200B;

Think of most of us as barrels, and our frustrations as gunpowder. Normal use of gunpowder is to take a portion of it, load it into the cannon, arm it (in this analogy with facts) aim it at an issue and fire for effect. This achieves some catharsis, some of those feeling are gone and we go on about our lives, hopefully the issue has been resolved.

At the moment however, our barrels are full. They're leaking gunpowder everywhere and we're not being given the opportunity to load those cannons and address the issues. 

Now, along come the actual tinfoilers. The kids who were never told "no" growing up, grew into adults with no boundaries. They love to sit at their keyboards and flick metaphorical matches out randomly just to see what happens. Maybe their match is homeopathy. Maybe it's 5G causes COVID. Maybe it's chiropracty, cupping or TCM. 

Pre-COVID, their match might have landed in a barrel, but with little powder in it, the damage is limited. They convince a parent to use pseudo-medicine and a child dies. The support gay conversion and screw up one or two lives. They convince a cancer patient that crystals will save them, and shave off a few months of their life, or potentially prevent remission. 

Now, however, they want us to congregate. To pack together, with our full barrels and lids off, so that they can flick their matches and wait for the bang. And maybe some of us have damp powder, so we don't go bang ourselves. We take it home and the smouldering core sets off a family member instead. Or several of them.

&amp;#x200B;

How do we stop this? Say no to these people. Be the parent they needed. Set healthy boundaries and enforce them and if necessary, cut them off.  Use some of your powder to take aim at the right targets: hysteria mongers, pseudoscience  quacks, narcissists and their ilk.

 Woolworths expects all customers to wear a mask or a face covering from Thursday **Woolworths expects all customers to wear a mask or a face covering from Thursday**

*By Dominic Powell*

Supermarket giant Woolworths has backflipped on its decision to allow customers who aren’t wearing masks to shop in its stores, announcing today it now expects all customers to wear a mask or a face covering from Thursday onwards.

The new rules will only apply to Melbourne and Mitchell Shire residents.

A spokesperson for Woolworths said the decision had been made in conjunction with the Supermarket Taskforce, meaning other major supermarkets such as Coles, Aldi and IGA will likely adopt a similar approach.

Woolworths staff will also be required to wear masks, which the supermarket is providing to its employees.

Earlier this week Woolworths had said it would permit non-masked customers to shop in its stores due to there being a "range of personal circumstances where masks aren’t recommended".

Woolworths now advises customers who cannot wear masks for any reason to use the retailer’s online delivery services or community pick-up option.

Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said the new rules weren't too much to ask of residents living in affected areas.

"For the safety of their staff, for the safety of other customers, and to keep stores open, so that there's no issue about supplies of food or no greater issues than we might otherwise expect, you need to wear a mask if you're going to the supermarket," he said.

"And you may well be turned away if you turn up at your Coles or Woolies or IGA if you don't have a mask on."

"It is not too much to ask people to wear a mask in order that they don't find themselves in hospital or contribute to somebody else [ending] up in hospital.

 Government to pay workers' wages for coronavirus  

The federal government is planning to pay a generous share of wages for closed and hobbled businesses that retain their employees during the coronavirus recession.

The payments, being worked on by Treasury, will be similar to wage subsidies of 75 per cent to 80 per cent introduced by Canada, Denmark, New Zealand and the United Kingdom in response to the virus shutting down large parts of the economy.

Sources told *The Australian Financial Review* on Saturday that Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Treasurer Josh Frydenberg were finalising government-funded wage payments, which are set to be capped at middle income earner levels.

The emergency wage payments are expected to be announced in the next few days.

 More than 1 million people are [expected to become jobless]( due to governments shutting down business activity in response to the coronavirus and enforcing strict social distancing rules. 

 

More than 1 million people are [expected to become jobless]( due to governments shutting down business activity in response to the coronavirus and enforcing strict social distancing rules.

Economists are forecasting the unemployment rate to soar to between 10 per cent and 15 per cent due to mass job axings across retail, travel, hospitality, entertainment, sport and leisure.

Asked about the prospect of stronger wage support for businesses, Finance Minister Mathias Cormann said the government was working to "significantly expand" income support through business.

"We are going to provide the best possible support that we sensibly can to support business to support Australians who are deeply impacted by this crisis," Senator Cormann told the ABC Insiders program on Sunday.

"We are looking very hard on further expanding the level of income support through businesses to enable more businesses to stay in hibernation or to survive through this difficult period ahead \[and\] for a strong bounce back on the other side."

Senator Cormman said it would be done in an "Australian way" through the existing tax and transfer system so payments could be delivered quickly.

He said it would "not be responsible" to adopt an entirely new system like the UK wage subsidy model, because it would be too slow to set up and inject money into businesses.

The wage subsidies would typically be paid if a struggling employer keeps staff on the employment books and plans to give them work after the virus crisis passes.

Senator Cormann said that would be the "intention" of the extra support for employers.

[Labor and economists have called for the government to pay large wage subsidies]( to help businesses cling on to workers and underwrite some of the private sector's $300 billion annual wage and salary bill.

The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry [has been lobbying for an 80 per cent wage subsidy]( based on a similar system to the UK, capped at average full time earnings of about $1600 a week.

Mr Morrison has said many businesses [will need to go into "hibernation"]( for around six months. He has warned that banks, landlords, energy companies, governments and employees will need to make financial sacrifices so affected businesses can emerge unencumbered by large debts after the crisis passes.

[Retailer Myer announced on Friday night]( it will close its stores from Monday and stand down 10,000 store and support centre staff, taking retail job losses from the [COVID-19 crisis]( to more than 40,000.

Myer's decision mirrors similar moves by Solomon Lew's Premier Investments, Country Road Group, [foot wear retailer Accent Group, jewellery chains Michael Hill and Lovisa, fashion retailers Mosaic Brands]( City Chic and PAS Group, outdoor leisure retailer Kathmandu, homewares retailer Adairs and autoparts retailer Bapcor.

Canada on the weekend announced a 75 per cent wage subsidy for small and medium businesses, up from an initial 10 per cent, to encourage firms to keep workers on the payroll.

New Zealand is providing wage subsidies to employers of $NZ585.80 per week for full-time workers and $NZ350 for part-time workers.

Kiwi businesses are being asked to pay their employees 80 per cent of their pre-virus income.

If employers can't afford this, they are being asked to pass on the subsidy in full to their workers.

British Prime Minister [Boris Johnson, who reported he was infected with the virus on Friday night, has pledged to pay 80 per cent of people's wages]( to firms that keep paying workers.

The UK scheme is capped at £2500 ($4900) per worker each month.

Mr Morrison had previously ruled out adopting Mr Johnson's UK scheme, saying during the week that Treasury was not advising it and that it would require a whole new system to be built.

Instead the government so far has used the existing tax and transfer system.

As part of the government's economic rescue packages announced earlier this month, it doubled the weekly welfare payment for the jobless to $550.

Mr Morrison also pledged tax credits to small businesses, worth on average about 20 per cent of their wage costs.

The payments were not contingent on firms retaining workers.

The government is [providing between $20,000 and $100,000 to small businesses with annual turnover under $50 million and not-for-profit employers.](

The employers will receive a payment equal to 100 per cent of the PAYG withholding tax paid to the Australian Taxation Office on behalf of workers, up from the 50 per cent initially slated.

The soon-to-be-announced wage subsidies will be more generous and be better linked to retaining staff.

 FINALLY! A digital relief package for businesses taking a hit from COVID-19 &amp;#x200B;



With an expected 1 Million to be unemployed in the coming months we have decided to give back by helping affected Australians get their businesses online. We've dedicated a team to support this cause we believe in.

We're all facing some challenging times right now.

But I don't have it as bad as others… so I want to give back.

Facebook is a depressing place for me to visit right now. I have thousands of friends on Facebook who are full time musicians (or were full time musicians).

Right now, their gigs are being cancelled, they have no income or way to support their families. I've got friends now who are selling their instruments online - and if you are a musician you would understand often your instrument is like a family member. It is heartbreaking.

Musicians are not the only ones who this is happening to. The worst-affected industries have been tourism, hospitality and airlines - and it doesn't stop there.

The total number of unemployed Australians could rise above one million in the coming weeks and months. (source)

I am one of the lucky ones whose income will not be greatly affected… at least not yet.

So I started looking at how I can help.

Many businesses have little or no cash to spare at this time, but getting online could save their business or at least extend their runway.

For example, I spoke to a restaurant owner who mentioned "If I can just take orders online then maybe I'll be ok.". Minutes later I spoke to a market stall tarot reader who queried "Do you think I can take bookings online and do tarot readings over skype?".

It occurred to me that we can help businesses with a new website and an online presence that might help them weather the storm.

With everyone confined to their homes and the hours spent browsing online is set to skyrocket… this is an opportunity for them to launch something they are passionate about, or to give their business a digital presence.

So, we have dedicated a small team who are now solely creating websites, for free, to Australians who have been affected. This is how we want to give back.

But that is not really a good reason, after all some states are planning to open their borders to other states that have a handle on covid in their state. This sounds like the start of a TA, SA, WA, NT &amp; QlD travel bubble.

But why the all-or-nothing approach to New Zealand? What reasons are there that NZ shouldn't join this bubble and that it needs to wait until Australia has a single bubble?

The only reason I could think of is Trans-Tasman travellers enter mixing with potential covid infected returnees from overseas and how they could intermixing with each other at international terminals. 

But you just deal with that by not allowing trans Tasman flights from airports dealing with returnees, like not allowing Brisbane to Auckland but allowing Gold Coast to Queenstown. Other safe international airports could be Townsville, Cairns, Sunshine Coast, Dunedin Wellington (plus places with abandoned international terminals such as Hobart, Hamilton (NZ), Rotorua, Palmerston North).

 Summary of today's National Cabinet Following today’s National Cabinet meeting it was agreed that everyone agreed in May to the detailed and specific three phase plan of reopening Australia, including ‘all interstate travel’ to be allowed in ‘phase three’.  


As agreed, each state started each phase at different times, and each phase had variations for each state.

  
During ‘phase three’, it was unanimously agreed that the states will de-restrict the borders. Or announce when they will de-restrict the borders. At any point during phase three. Or before, or after, depending on the state.

  
So everyone was in total unity to act as a team, and do their own thing in their own way. The plan agreed to in May makes it very clear exactly what will be happening and when, providing Australian families and businesses certainty that there will be certainty at some point in the future when certainty can be announced. (subject to change and High Court decisions).  


The PM said "Speaking on behalf of all the states and the federal government, but also only for myself personally, together, we'll continue to work in isolation from one another, accepting that outbreaks will occur, striving for elimination, except when we’re not, and continuing to restrict while re-opening and suppressing. I've been perfectly consistent on this - why do the media and average joes keep misunderstanding the clear and simple message?"  


The Premiers were heard complaining of being "bullied into letting people exercise their constitutional right to travel into their state from plague overrun areas like Ballarat and Dubbo". And "how dare the Federal Government continue to prevent full fee paying international students from returning to universities from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. But I repeat myself".  


In other news, China continues to prove how good a friend they are to Australia by providing direct assistance to elected MPs, relieving them of the work of developing their own opinions.

 Covid-19 restrictions has made it difficult for some of us to pay honor to those who passed away.. Hello everyone.. In these tough times.. it's noticeable that some of us whose families or friends that had unfortunately passed away bcs of the horrible COVID-19 virus, to be having trouble in paying their honor to their beloved late ones.. Funerals are restricted, travelling is limited, we have to undergo quarantines, etc..

Unfortunately where death toll is on it's heights, proper ceremonial is on it's lowest.. It's difficult times for them..

Everybody's life is worthy of remembering.. I don't know how helpful this could be, but I created an online memorial creator website that could enable them to at least pay honor to their beloved late ones by creating a beautiful special online memorial.. I thought creating an online memorial might help them as a slight substitute to paying honor in funerals to their beloved late ones..

If you don't mind me sharing, fyi, the website name is www.murial.life . In it people could upload photos, and invite families/friends to share their thoughts of the one who passed away, in a special beautifully designed dedicated website page.. It's an online memorial that might function like a special life page/mini biography.. 

[Murial Online Memorials](www.murial.life)
Because I hope it could be valuable to those in need, I made this website to be completely free to use.. Hope this could be a blessing to someone.. Just wanting to let you know with it.. My heart goes out to you all..

As a Queenslander I just wanted to say how sorry I am for the hardships you all, especially in Melbourne, are facing.

If anyone needs a pen friend to vent to, for example, I’m totally up for it. I know there seems to be the sentiment sometimes that the rest of the country is laughing at you in some way. Speaking for myself and everyone here I’ve discussed this with, we feel nothing but compassion for you. 

Anyone know of any initiatives or have any suggestions for what we in the rest of the country can be doing to support our Victorian siblings?

 Australian Story story A short Australian Story story

Recently an ABC Australian Story cameraman's direct relative came back from overseas. It is now known that relative is infected with COVID-19 and lives with the Cameraman.

Before infection was disclosed:

That Cameraman had been filming footage in close quarters, eg recently with one of my direct elderly relatives for upcoming Australian Story content. 

That relative met with me.

In the days that followed I already had the normal close contact with my family including school aged children.

Those school aged children are due to return to school tomorrow.

To date I have been very careful with hygiene and precautions, and no symptoms so far. I guess I had fairly low risk of transfer, but the question arises - at what point do I/we need to self isolate.

I can see how this is going to spread quickly.

 COVID19 is the catalyst for a planned 'WORLD JUBILEE'  I have done a lot of research and I am Now able to tell you how much thy are stealing and why. 

**Remember it's not personal theft, those doing this do not want to steal your money and put it in their bank accounts, they want to bankrupt you and the whole world, and its all planned!**

Over the years the world has saved enough excess money (stored away in Disaster and Emergency Funds) so if lets say a 'PANDEMIC' happens and it was a worldwide disaster, we all just get paid out, just like when bush fires come around and the government pays so we dont loose financially. 

Only it's a scam, as **there is no pandemic** and yet we all loose our jobs and more, **get paid out** **with** **our countries Disaster and Emergency Funds**  (while governments worldwide steal that money and pay Trillions to their friends and associates and those countries, agencies and authorities who supported their fraud.)

**So they are paying us, and all their mates off with our money**, then guess what, there is nothing but debt for all, no disaster funds left any whwere in the world, and what happens when the next **REAL** **disaster happens**, there will be **no money** and the world will barely be standing on two feet from the financial destruction to all our personal saving which would be enough just to fix their underpaid mortgage or rent or loans, and I bet the tax rate will be like the 80's with 10%-24% interest. With the average citizen now penniless, with no backup funds, and all of us heavily blacklisted by not paying bills, rent, rates etc. As we focus on food and toilet paper. 

Yet all the big companies are all lining up with hands out, the politicians all get praised for saving us from the pandemic, as the robbed all our saving all the insurance money all the wealth of our homes, our businesses, our countries GDP, everything is bad, and we have now no backstops.

 NSW Gov: $10 million grants program to assist women to get back into the workforce 16 November 2020

# Women across the state will have access to grants of up to $5000 through the NSW Government’s new $10 million Return to Work program, as part of the 2020-21 NSW Budget.

Premier Gladys Berejiklian said the program would provide women with financial assistance and targeted support including mentoring, advice and training to help them return to the workforce.

&gt;**“These grants will help women whose employment has been affected by COVID-19 to overcome some of the obstacles in returning to the workforce,” Ms Berejiklian said.**  
&gt;  
&gt;“I encourage women from all walks of life to apply for these grants and use this springboard to jump back into their former career or even start a new one.” 

Treasurer Dominic Perrottet said helping more women get back to work will not only provide a financial lifeline for them and their families, it will also boost the economy.

&gt;**“We know that many part-time or casual positions and female-dominated industries were severely impacted by COVID-19, so we are looking to empower as many women as possible to be able to get back into paid employment,” Mr Perrottet said.** 

It is estimated that women make up 53 per cent of directly affected industries and 65 per cent of secondary industries impacted by the pandemic. These include accommodation and food services, retail, arts, and professional services.   

**Minister for Women Bronnie Taylor said the grants are available to all women who have been out of work for at least one month.**

&gt;“There are so many costs involved in starting up again, so it is great that women looking to return to work will be able to use these grants towards things like training and education, office supplies, or whatever it is they need to get back into a job,” Mrs Taylor said.  
&gt;  
&gt;“The money can also be used for childcare, including before and after school care and transport, which will really help mothers overcome some of the biggest barriers to getting back into work.”

Eligible recipients will be given a Return to Work Coordinator to develop a plan, which will set out the resources that will assist them getting back in the workforce. **They must be a resident of NSW and plan to start paid work within six months.**

The Return to Work Program aligns with the NSW Women’s Strategy, which sets the NSW Government’s priorities for supporting women and girls, especially following times of crisis.

 Victoria: Australia's failure. World success story Have noticed some prominent people praising Australia's response to our second wave.

For example, Kristian Anderson (one of the world's top virologists) writes:

&gt;**Australia once again shows us how it's done. Very impressive.**



The Twitter discussion among other virologists and followers is an interesting read.

Bill Gates also calls out Australia as an example of a model response (in contrast to the US response):

&gt;"We did a very poor job, and you could of see that in the numbers if you compare the Asian countries like South Korea and Australia."



So just wanted to bring some perspective. The point is to not trivialise the lives that have been lost, or the jobs and livelihoods that have been interrupted. Or to deny that we made mistakes and could not have done better. But let's take some encouragement. While Victoria's response may have been the worst in Australia, it's still among the best in the world.

 CORONAVIRUS UPDATE PLEASE READ AND COMMENT, ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE POLITICAL EXPERIENCE. The PM announced a major development and I don’t understand why it is been overlooked… I can’t find anyone talking about it in the news or in social media. 

A Human Biosecurity Emergency has been declared which gives the government a whole new set of powers. 

Please read the following and go through the legislation I’ve cited. It won’t change what’s about to happen, but I think people should have hard facts and not have to rely on rumours or news outlets. 

I have learned all I can on my own and I hope a discussion will shed light on what the future holds for us. 

1. On Wednesday March 18th Scott Morrison announced that the National Security Committee (NSC) has declared a “human biosecurity emergency” in accordance with the *Biosecurity Act 2015*. (1) 

2. The NSC is “the peak decision-making body for national security…matters in the Australian Government. It is a committee of the Cabinet of Australia though **decisions of the NSC do not require the endorsement of the Cabinet itself.”** (2)

3. The *Biosecurity Act 2015* “is about managing diseases…that may cause harm to (human health)” and can be found in full on this website: [

4. Chapter 8, Part 2 of the act relates to human biosecurity emergencies. Section 476 specifies that the Health Minister may extend the emergency period for as long as they are satisfied it is necessary (see SECT 476(1) and 476(3)). Basically the Health Minister is solely in charge here. He does not require Cabinet or Parliament approval at this stage. 

5 As you’re about to discover, he can issue any requirements that he is “satisfied” are necessary to “protect human health”. Here are the relevant sections….

**BIOSECURITY ACT 2015 (NO. 61, 2015) - SECT 477** 

**Health Minister may determine emergency requirements during human biosecurity emergency period**

During a human biosecurity emergency period, the Health Minister may determine any requirement that he or she is satisfied is necessary to prevent or control the entry of the disease into Australian or the spread of disease in Australia or to prevent the spread to another country. The Legislative Instruments Act 2003 **does not apply** to the determination. These requirements may include but are not limited to restrictions or preventions of movement of people and goods or evacuations. Any decisions remain in place until the emergency period has ended. A person who fails to comply with a requirement may commit an offence. 

**6** **SECT 478**

**Health Minister may give directions during human biosecurity emergency period**

The minister may give any direction, to any person, that he believes necessary to prevent or control the spread of disease, including (but not limited to) directing people to close or prevent access to a premises. Refusal to comply is an offence. 

7 Failure to comply with requirements under sections 477 or 478 can result in 5 years prison or a $50,000 fine. In the real world it might not come to all that, but you can definitely be arrested and charged. 

8 When you put the three relevant sections together, it appears that the Health Minister can order almost unrestricted requirements of the Australian people as long as the emergency is declared, and the emergency can be extended as many times as the Health Minister decides. 

9 Other issues outlined in the Act include 

\- Powers to enter, search and take samples from premises. 

\- Requirements to provide body samples

\- Requirements to provide information 

\- Powers to “accompany” children and “incapable” people without *first* notifying the parents or caregivers 

\- Powers to seize or destroy goods

\- Requirements for people to receive a vaccine, treatment or medication

\- Forced isolation

&amp;#x200B;

I did summarise the information in the ACT as sections of acts can be long and difficult to read due their formatting. I want everyone to be able to understand and contribute. If you follow the link at the end of this paragraph you will find copy of the act that is easy to navigate, is well divided, and has a clickable contents page. [

If any of this is inaccurate, comment and I will EDIT the post to correct it. I know spreading false information is part of the problem.

 Minister for Health: Our thanks to the staff of the National Incident Centre after a year of continuous operation # Our thanks to the staff of the National Incident Centre after a year of continuous operation

*8th November 2020*

**The Hon Greg Hunt MP**  
Minister for Health

\--

For the first time in its history, Australia’s National Incident Centre has been activated continuously for more than one year to respond to unprecedented health emergencies.

For the first time in its history, Australia’s National Incident Centre (NIC) has been activated continuously for more than one year, working across Government to respond to unprecedented health emergencies faced by Australia and the world.

The NIC was activated in November 2019 in response to a measles outbreak in Samoa, and continued to act during the 2019–20 bushfires, the Whakaari Island volcano eruption and, most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic.

From December 2019 and into January 2020, the NIC was concurrently managing three different situations, also for the first time ever.

I want to thank all of the extraordinarily talented, dedicated and hardworking staff of the National Incident Centre over the past year. Led by the Department of Health, the staff have been drawn from across Government, including the ADF.

Their work around the clock allowed Australia to maintain an air bridge for critical and scarce global supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) and test kits at a time of international shortage. The NIC has literally been the Operations Headquarters for Australia’s national response to the pandemic. 

Never has the National Incident Centre been more important, and its worth is shown in the Medical Journal of Australia’s paper, which attributes the saving of 16,000 lives to the comprehensive and early nature of Australia’s response. 

The staff of the NIC have embodied the concept of real and profound public service. We are fortunate to have had such a well-prepared and well-drilled centre as the NIC in place before the pandemic. We are even more fortunate to have such an extraordinarily capable and dedicated team to help save lives and protect lives across Australia.

As the Department of Health’s emergency operations centre, the NIC coordinates Australia's health emergency response to national and international incidents. It is also the primary means of communication between the World Health Organization and Australia for public health events, including the COVID-19 pandemic.

 A significant accomplishment was distributing millions of masks and other PPE from the National Medical Stockpile in response to the bushfires and COVID-19 to states and territories, aged care facilities, disability service providers and Primary Health Networks.

As part of the COVID-19 response, key staff from a range of agencies across the APS were seconded to help operate the NIC. At its peak, the NIC engaged more than 200 employees, including liaison officers from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Australian Border Force and the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. Surge staff have included epidemiologists and analysts from the Department of Defence, the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment and the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare.

The NIC has also engaged in public information, community awareness and communications. The Australian Government has the strongest commitment to informing the community about the latest health advice and developments. This includes a national campaign, website, fact sheets, media liaison and social media.

The NIC was first formally activated for the SARS outbreak of 2003. It has since been activated for a range of emergencies including the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004, the Bali bombings of 2005, the H1N1 Pandemic in 2009, the Victorian bushfires of 2009, and the Christchurch earthquake of 2011.

I thank the hardworking public servants in the NIC, which will remain activated for as long as this national health emergency demands.

 PSA from Drs who work in the private sector at the Mount Hospital, Perth This message a family member received yesterday. Please heed and share.   



Public service announcement from
Doctors who work in the private sector at the Mount Hospital Perth : ￼



As a group of 10 cardiac anaesthetists working at the Mount, we believe the government isn’t acting as quickly as this situation demands.  


As a combined group we are receiving a great deal of local and international updates. We are reviewing all of this information and performing our own calculations. Collectively we feel the government is acting about two weeks too late with most of their decisions. We want the public to take their own sensible measures now and not wait for delayed government instruction.
The time to go into lockdown isn’t now, but a week ago.


We have been so lucky in Perth to have a two-week window to see what is happening in other states and countries. We must use this advantage to the maximum benefit.  
We are asking you to consider:   
·      ACTING EARLIER THAN YOU THINK IS NECESSARY.   
·      IF THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T CLOSE SCHOOLS TODAY, PLEASE, IF AT ALL POSSIBLE, TAKE YOUR CHILDREN OUT NOW.  
·      DO NOT GO TO RESTAURANTS OR CAFES, ANY GATHERINGS OR MEETINGS, GYM, PILATES, THE HAIRDRESSERS, THE PODIATRIST, THE MASSEUSE, ANY PARTIES OR SMALL GATHERINGS, ETC ETC – THAT MEANS NOTHING EXCEPT THE BAREST ESSENTIALS NECESSARY TO SUSTAIN LIFE, EG FOOD, AND MEDICINES.  
·      STAY AT HOME! YOU ARE A POTENTIAL CARRIER  
·      DO NOT GO TO HOSPITAL FOR ANYTHING OTHER THAN EMERGENCY CARE.  
·      DO NOT UNDERTAKE ELECTIVE SURGERY UNLESS DEEMED ESSENTIAL BY YOUR DOCTORS 
IT is essential everyone does their part. It would be best if you acted NOW. Please protect not only yourself and your family, but also you will be protecting your community as well.

 The Minister for Government Services is now taking back suggestions the Federal Government's MyGov website was hit by a cyber attack.  

The Minister for Government Services is now walking back suggestions the Federal Government's MyGov website was hit by a cyber attack.  
 

Earlier, Stuart Robert said the website, which is the online portal for many Centrelink services, had been hit by a “denial of service” attack.

  
That sort of attack floods a website with users, stopping people accessing it. Mr Robert has now told Question Time the high number of people logging on to the site to claim unemployment benefits mirrored such an attack, triggering internal alarms. He says there was **no evidence of a specific attack today**.

 Are we Australians or not? The Australian Government has the power to stop the rot on border closures. They don’t want to because then they will be accused of causing deaths. But hey, people die every day from car accidents, but they let us drive. Using state boundaries to stop movement is an hamfisted, sledge hammer to a nut solution. People who save the lives of animals, like sheep farmers, are an essential service who must be permitted to visit their farm, especially if they aren’t coming close to any other human. I am not a sheep farmer and I live in a big city. 

I have no problems with appropriate shutdowns, restrictions for hotspots and the like. But don’t give me state border lockdowns. I am, you are, we are Australians. Not a Victorian, not Queenslander, not a Tasmanian. State border closures are no more appropriate than stopping Australians from Wollongong and Port Kembla from interacting. If there is a hotspot in Wollongong, fine, do it, but do it by the data, not by State politics. 

Do the job ScoMo, don’t just let State premiers turn their states into little countries, and destroy a nation.

 NSW Gov: Plans for New Year’s Eve and festive season *19 November 2020*

**The NSW Government has today outlined details for COVID-Safe events ahead of the festive season, including arrangements for New Year’s Eve fireworks.**

Premier Gladys Berejiklian said the changes will give residents a chance to prepare for and embrace end of year activities including outdoor religious gatherings and other outdoor events, including Christmas carols.

&gt;“2020 has been a tough year for everyone and we want people to be able to look forward to the festive season in a COVID-Safe way,” Ms Berejiklian said.

The Premier also announced NSW will bring in 2021 with a seven-minute midnight New Year’s Eve firework display and premium viewing spots reserved only for frontline workers to say thank you for keeping NSW safe throughout this year.

**Unless you have a New Year’s Eve Pass through Service NSW you will not be able to enter designated zones around Circular Quay, North Sydney and the City.**

The vast majority of citizens will not be allowed into the Sydney CBD precinct.

**New Public Health Orders will be drafted to support COVID-Safe New Year’s Eve celebrations including:**

* Premium spots reserved for frontline workers around Mrs Macquarie’s Point, Sydney Opera House, Campbell’s Cove and the Cahill Expressway.
* A special area around Circular Quay and North Sydney will only be accessible to venue patrons, hospitality workers, residents and guests of residents who will be required to carry a special NYE Pass from Service NSW.

**In addition, from Monday, 23 November the following restrictions will be eased:** 

Increased capacity for outdoor religious services:

* Up to 500 people outdoors, provided the audience is seated (with 1 person per 2 square metres if assigned a seat, or 1 person per 4 square metres if seated in an allocated seated area (e.g. where the grass is marked or on picnic rugs).
* Increased capacity for outdoors singing and carols: 
* Up to 30 singers will be permitted outdoors, subject to COVID-safe requirements (the limit of 5 remains for indoor venues). The audience or congregation may participate in the singing, but anyone 12 years or older must wear a mask. 
* Increased capacity for controlled outdoor events (such as concerts) that are ticketed and held in an enclosed or fenced area:
* Up to 3000 people can attend with 1 person per 2 square metres if assigned a seat, or 1 person per 4 square metres if seated in an allocated seated area (e.g. where the grass is marked or on picnic rugs). 

In addition, capacity at funerals will increase to 300 people from 1 December.

Minister for Health Brad Hazzard said meeting up outdoors is the best way to stay COVID-safe this festive season.

&gt;“After an exceptionally challenging year, we want everyone to have the opportunity to celebrate and make the most of summer and get outdoors,” Mr Hazzard said.

Minister for Jobs, Investment, Tourism and Western Sydney Stuart Ayres said the NSW Government recognised that many businesses around Circular Quay relied on NYE customers as one of the biggest nights of the year.

&gt;“New Year’s Eve is the chance for Sydney and NSW to shine on the world stage. Despite being a smaller celebration to normal, this New Years demonstrates that we are open for business and NSW will bring in 2021 with confidence,” said Mr Ayres.

Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant said NSW Health recognises the importance of the festive season and has worked hard to make COVID-Safe celebrations possible including the singing of carols.

&gt;“Everyone needs to continue to be alert to the ongoing risk of transmission and to keep practising physical distancing and good hand hygiene, and most importantly to get tested and isolate if they feel unwell,” Dr Chant said.

 This pandemic has made me just how poor the general maths and science education is in Australian high schools. I have seen an insane amount of people not understanding and or completely misinterpreting simple concepts such as the R number, basic infection control, basic understandings of vaccines and simple year 9 biology (when discussing the virus).

Do you guys agree? 

Is this an issue with our general education system not really teaching people properly or is it more a case of some people being a bit thick in the head?

“I got angry looking for masks, they’re either all sold out, or the  masks that are from overseas are sold at an inflated price,” Tang said,  wearing a mask, at the factory set up close to the border with the  mainland.  

“So I thought, making a mask isn’t that hard, just some fabric sewn together, how about I make my own factory?” 

Tang  and his financial backers paid $150,000 to import a machine from a  factory near Chennai, in India. It makes 100,000 masks per day, and Tan  hopes to have eight machines running by April. 

The masks made in the citizen’s group will be sold exclusively online for HK$1 (13 U.S. cents) a piece.

 JobKeeper is half-baked Fair enough the purpose is noble and justified. The execution is poor and there are grey areas everywhere - if you think JobKeeper isn't fucked because of this, you're more concerned about your own bottom line and not the bigger picture. Many employers are screwed enough as it is and people seem to forget that we need businesses to mitigate this impending recession. Employees with a sense of entitlement bigger than the stick up their ass are everything wrong with this country.

Honestly, why don't we show some more bloody respect for employers...

 All Compensation for Lost Revenue across Australia (South Australia, New South Wales, Queensland) should come out of Victoria State Labor Financial Funds All three of these states were doing well and on track to eradicating the coronavirus cases in their own states. However, this retarded Victoria State government under Daniel Andrews bungled up this entire mess (first by not holding transparent tender procedures, and by not using the ADF) and now other states are paying for this retard's mistakes in form of lost revenue and shutdowns across the state. Daniel Andrews still has the nerve to pretend he is suffering when he cause this whole mess. Australia could have contained this mess by now if it wasn't for him.

Seeing as how every other state (particularly Labor held Western Australia under Mark McGowan and Labor held Queensland under Anastasia Palaszczuk, as well as South Australia, New South Wales and Tasmania) managed to get their quarantine procedures together, we should just make Victoria State Labor foot this loss in economic revenue, those retards who got us into this mess.

 Emergency ventilators I posted this to a comment on China\_Flu but was hoping I might get help here.

My colleagues and I are trying to work on a solution that can be manufactured and used anywhere. Iron lungs were mass produced during the polio epidemic, it's old (150 years: google spirophore) technology but the principles are sound. Advantage of not needing medications, or necessarily even trained medical people to use it.

It's not helpful in someone critically ill without supplemental oxygen, and I wouldn't presume it replaces a PPV ventilator, but it may buy some time for patients who would otherwise die, think someone in a regional town awaiting retrieval.  


We are trying to (re)create a cuirass ventilator. It uses a rigid cuirass shell around the thorax which expands the chest using negative pressure.

The trick is designing it so it can be mass produced by anyone, anywhere. We are experimenting using a vacuum cleaner to create the negative pressure. The main problem is controlling the cycling. Ideally it would have positive pressure on expiration, but this is much more difficult.

If anyone reads this and can advise/help it would be much appreciated. I can manage the medical side, but am not an engineer.

We were looking to make this work locally, but no reason it can't be national.

 Is there a financial plan in place when we lock down?  With an entire shutdown looming and nearly (if not more than) 1/3rd of the country on casual employment with many of those in Hospitality and Retail (the directly effected)

My partner and I are both in the hospo industry on a casual employment basis and live week to week. We have to rent as we can't afford mortgage. So if pubs, restaurants etc are forced to close doors..we're financially ruined and lose everything. And I'm sure we're not alone in this. I'm out of touch with the current measures being put in place by the government to assure stability (if any) so I'm just making this post to find out..what do we do? What happens from here?

Surely our government can't condemn hundreds of thousands of us to financial ruin?

I was under the assumption that if a crisis like this ever came across us that the government would push banks to be a little more lenient with mortgage payments and so fourth which would trickle down to renters and small businesses paying leases on buildings. I also figured they'd scrap/lower late fee's and add grace periods for those who are late for any bill payment.  


Directing all of us to Centrelinks dole payment is a recipe for disaster as the entire system is already under heavy duress. Which can and more than likely will leave thousands of Australians without payment on time or at all.

 Summary of press conference with PM and Treasurer (30/03/2020) **Scott Morrison**

* The health and economic battle is an unprecedented twin threat. This calls for unprecedented action.
* The have applied ourselves in delivering plan, as an economic lifeline for Australian's to make it through the months ahead.
* Many countries may see their economies collapse. But not Australia. Our goal is to protect lives, and livelihoods.
* Previously, 2 support packages with a combined total of $70 billion have been announced. This was added to by a further $15 billion dollars from states and territories.
* It's been about cushioning the blow. Keeping workers in jobs. Keeping businesses in business
* Today we are announcing a further $130 billion over 6 months, to protect an estimated 6 million Australian's who will need that support. 
* We have already boosted the Jobseeker payment for those who have lost their jobs. Today we are introducing a $1500 per fortnight Jobkeeper payment, to prevent people from losing their jobs even when work dries up.
* This plan will see businesess across the countries will share the load with the welfare system.
* All workers will be treated the same, regardless of what they earn. There is not more support for some as there is for others.

**Treasurer Josh Frydenberg**

* We are facing a health crisis and an economic crises. The past two weeks have been tough, but the weeks ahead will be tougher. No matter how great the challenges is, the Government has Australians' backs. 
* We have been focussing on preparing and resourcing our healthcare system. But have not lost sight of cushioning the economic blow. 
* The Government will be supporting bank to provide 6 month reprieve from those unable to make payments.
* We will ensure that tenants have a 6 month moratorium from on evictions for non-payment due to economic distress.
* We are providing cash payments of up to $100,000 to small and medium sized enterprises. 
* At a cost of over $130 billion we will be supporting Australian workers with a $1500 per week Jobkeeper payment.  It will be available to full and part time workers, sole traders, and in the case of casuals to those who have been with their employer for 12 months or more.  
*  From today, employers and sole traders will be able to apply to the Australian Tax Office. The payments will flow from the first week of May and be backdated to today. If employees have been stood down by their employer since March 1, they are still eligible for these payments. To be eligible, their payments will need to have fallen by 30 per cent or more. 
* This wage subsidy scheme is more generous than New Zealand's and broader than the United Kingdom's. 
*  This unprecedented level of support reflects the unprecedented moment that we are in. The announcement today is the means by which Australians can get to the other side of this coronavirus crisis.

**Further clarifications during questions:**

* The scheme applies to New Zealanders on 444 visas. New Zealanders on 444 visas don't get access to the welfare system, but they are getting access to this JobKeeper payment.  
* The new payments will apply to not-for-profits.
* Employers are encouraged to talk to their employer and ask if they are registering for the Jobkeeper program.
* You cannot apply for both Jobseeker and Jobkeeper.  If you were an employee on the books from March 1, you would be eligible for this payment. If you were an employer who was forced to retrench workers, you will put them back on your books and you will be eligible for this payment.
* If you're claiming JobSeeker, the partner pay income test, which was once restricted to an annual wage around $40,000, has now been boosted to just under $80,000.

 WorkSafe can stop a Victorian third wave From [the Strayan](

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The basic systems breakdowns that caused Victoria’s hotel quarantine industrial disaster have not been rectified and have been repeated again in the latest northern suburbs outbreak.  
&gt;  
&gt;As a result, this time, a major part of the blame for the business losses and personal tragedies resulting from the outbreak sits squarely on WorkSafe.  
&gt;  
&gt;Victoria maybe lucky and be able to contain this outbreak but the systems breakdown means there is a grave danger of a third wave.   
&gt;  
&gt;And, as I will explain below, Worksafe’s failure to act is enabling the anarchist movement and professional protesters to start harnessing the protesters.  
&gt;  
&gt;In theory, the Labor politicians outside the inner group could act but they are frozen with fear.  
&gt;  
&gt;WorkSafe has the power to fix the management systems failures by recommending the prosecution of ministers and public servants as is required by the Occupational Health and Safety Act.   
&gt;  
&gt;An alarmed Prime Minister now understands the crisis Victoria faces because its government and public servants have embraced systems that don’t work.  
&gt;  
&gt;In a carefully worded statement partly directed at WorkSafe, Scott Morrison said: “This is a profound disappointment. Victoria’s public health systems are either up to the task of dealing with future outbreaks or they are not.  
&gt;  
&gt;“The decision to keep businesses closed suggests that there is still not sufficient confidence within the government that their systems can support reopening.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Former Labor premier Steve Bracks devised Victoria’s excellent occupational health and safety rules for exactly this situation: a breakdown in systems causing death or substantial community harm.   
&gt;  
&gt;Self-Employed Australia has requested that WorkSafe recommend prosecutions but that petition gives the organisation until December 29 to act. The nation can’t wait that long. Under the Bracks rules WorkSafe has to prosecute people who use dangerous and faulty systems. Any failure to do so is endangering the nation and Victoria as well as causing huge losses. It may trigger of loss if life.  
&gt;  
&gt;Mission failure  
&gt;  
&gt;Victoria abandoned cabinet responsibility in the crisis and set up a unique “mission” system, which completely failed and led to the deaths of hundreds of people.  
&gt;  
&gt;Considerable improvement was later made in contact tracing and testing but the basic flawed systems remain and caused this latest outbreak to become very dangerous.  
&gt;  
&gt;A Somali family with three children became infected. Each member of the family had a case manager and there was also an interpreter. But, as we saw in the hotel quarantine systems breakdown the government employees were not trained to work together and communicate. The interpreter was not used properly.  
&gt;  
&gt;The family actually tried hard and went to the school for advice. But public servants in the education OHS wing didn’t know how to co-ordinate with the case managers: exactly the same systems break down that occurred in the hotels.  
&gt;  
&gt;An infected boy went to school and naturally the outbreak spread in exactly the same way as the hotels. The government puts blame in the Islamic community instead of itself.  
&gt;  
&gt;WorkSafe chief Colin Radford was a press secretary to Steve Bracks and if he feels that his mateship with politicians and public servants prevents him from recommending prosecution then he should stand aside.   
&gt;  
&gt;Yet because of his involvement with the excellent Bracks occupation health and safety legislation he is well placed to do his job. It is not easy to prosecute ministers and senior public servants but Bracks made sure they were covered by the legislation.  
&gt;  
&gt;But unless prosecution action is taken, the Victorian government will not embrace cabinet responsibility like the rest of the nation and in accordance with its disaster plan. Only when prosecutions start will the Victorian government fix its broken systems.  
&gt;  
&gt;The legislation states: “It is an offence under the OHS Act (s23) to fail to ensure that persons other than employees are not exposed to risks to their health and safety arising from the conduct of the employer.”  
&gt;  
&gt;And elsewhere: “If the body corporate commits an OH&amp;S offence and the contravention can be attributed to a failure by any officer of the body corporate to take reasonable care, the officer is also guilty of an offence.”  
&gt;  
&gt;It will not be easy for Bracks to advise Radford but he set the legislation up for exactly this sort of situation.  
&gt;  
&gt;Had there been a major disaster where private enterprise systems broke down prosecution would have been swift so that the accident could not be repeated again and again.  
&gt;  
&gt;Victorians now hope that the latest outbreak can be contained. But there is a new danger. The fury of the small enterprises that have been ravaged by the continued systems breakdown has been harnessed by anarchist and professional protest groups.  
&gt;  
&gt;The next set of protests will be massive and will be professionally organised. And because people will not be wearing masks they will most certainly create a third wave of infection devastating Victoria and the nation.  
&gt;  
&gt;Only one man can stop this happening — Colin Radford.  
&gt;  
&gt;Please Mr Radford do the job that you are required to do. It will not be pleasant but nation and the state of Victoria depends on you.

 Essential services: companies vie for exemptions as industry shuts down  

From steelmakers to arts-and-crafts retailers, dozens of companies across the US are arguing that their operations are essential, raising questions over how to preserve as much economic activity as possible while working to contain the coronavirus.

The companies are trying to make the case that their work is essential for the livelihood of their workers and the public good. Requests from companies to stay open have continued as more of the country and many workers retreat to their homes as the pandemic gains pace.

New York governor Andrew Cuomo on Friday ordered all non-essential businesses in the state to close and said residents should stay home. He said the restrictions would take effect Sunday evening.

Illinois governor J.B. Pritzker issued a similar order for people to stay home starting Saturday.

California, the largest state economy, on Thursday extended a regional lockdown to the state’s entire population of 40 million.

Pennsylvania governor Tom Wolf ordered all “non-life-sustaining” businesses in that state to close, too.

In response to exemption requests from steelmakers, the aerospace and defence industry, food companies, and others, the Trump administration on Thursday identified 16 industries as critical to the national response to the pandemic. The Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency recommended that states maintain “critical” manufacturing operations as well as production of food and agriculture. The agency mentioned sectors including defence, transportation and energy in the shutdown-exemption guidelines.

The orders in California and some other states exempt defence companies, but some executives said some of their smaller suppliers were being affected because local officials weren’t following federal guidance. Defence companies have also called on the Pentagon to relax contractual requirements that, for example, halt funding if a factory has to close for a period because of local travel restrictions.

Thomas Gibson, president of the American Iron and Steel Institute, a trade group, welcomed the federal designation for metal makers. “Now, it is important that the states follow this federal lead,” he said.

The Pennsylvania order excluded companies including United States Steel and other metal manufacturers with plants that are difficult to quickly idle. The Pennsylvania Manufacturers’ Association on Friday urged the governor to widen those exemptions.

“This is going to badly disrupt all of our production,” said David N. Taylor, the association’s president. Even some manufacturers allowed to stay open, the association said, faced a shortage of supplies from companies ordered to close.

The National Association of Manufacturers earlier this week asked governors and mayors to designate every US manufacturer as “essential infrastructure”.

“Nothing happens without manufacturing, so you want to make sure we’re not shutting down our ability to recover,” Jay Timmons, the association’s chief executive, said.

Dukal’s warehouse in Riverside, California, is continuing to unpack and deliver orders of medical equipment despite the statewide order. Dukal, which imports face masks and other protective equipment, said it had told its 15 workers at the warehouse to show a business card if they are stopped by police on their way to or from work.

“The frontline people who are in healthcare have to stay open,” said Dukal president Gerry LoDuca.

Edward Kangeter, chief executive of scrap metal recycler CASS, said Friday that he would continue to operate his Oakland-based collection-and-processing business under the state’s allowance for suppliers to steel and aluminium producers.

“If you don’t have recycling like ours, that would be an environmental catastrophe,” Mr Kangeter said.

Some manufacturing companies have decided to close after the pandemic has reached close to their workforces. Arcimoto, a maker of small electric vehicles, halted production this week in Eugene, Oregon, and temporarily laid off about 80 of its 110 workers after someone in their county tested positive for the virus.

Chief executive Mark Frohnmayer said once the disease was found nearby, the decision to close was easy.

“If you don’t, you are really risking everyone who you are putting into that work environment,” Mr Frohnmayer said.

“Is this truly an essential activity? If it’s not, just pause.”

Newspapers have also pushed to have their operations deemed essential.
