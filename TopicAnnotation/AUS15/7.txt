 How hard would it be for Australia to make n95 masks? I'm concerned that the mask mandate we here in Victoria have been given may be creating a false sense of security and indirectly doing more harm than good. Given how much money is being spent on this crisis, would it not be unreasonable to manufacture n95 masks ourselves?

 How do you ask your boss if you should go into the office? I work in a design agency and it isn't exactly essential. Despite it being an office job, our boss hasn't allowed anyone to work from home. I am only a part timer and the past two weeks have been very quiet.

How should I message my boss asking if I should go in tomorrow?

On one hand, I need money. But I know that I will be somewhat ok as I will be eligible for some of the government benefits and have some savings to tie me over for a few weeks. I am also worried if this carries on for too long (ie over the few weeks) then I will actually be broke if I don't work so I should try and work now while I can.

Is going to work at a graphic design agency a valid excuse if I am asked by police?

 My boss is forcing us to work in yhe office. My boss is forcing us to go into the office even thought our work can be done from home ( i work in sales). I'm scared about loosing my job by refusing to go into the office. But I don't want to risk my health by going in. I am currently on Job Keeper. 

Is there anything I can do about it?

 Super early access So I’ve read that to be eligible to access your super early you must have had your working hours reduced by 20% or more. 

I’ve had to take a 20% pay cut but I’m still working the same hours. Can anyone tell me if that would fall under the above as sufficient criteria to access my super?

 How does government debt work? I have two scenarios :
1) The government borrows money to pay workers. We pay our taxes and the government does what it does with that revenue.
2) the government borrows $60,000,000 less. We pay our taxes and the government does what it does with that revenue.

Am I missing something?

 Is there any help for non-residents? Starting to freak out a little! I have worked as a personal trainer at a gym for 4 years, but as of yesterday I have lost my job for the foreseeable future. As a non-resident pommie, is there any help from the government I can get? Centrelink seems to be strictly for residents. Fortunately my landlord seems to be understanding for now, and I am in the process of talking to the bank to pause my car loan repayments. I am not sure how long my savings will keep me afloat though!

 Can i get $10 grand from my super ? I've been stood down at work and been put on jobkeeper and have not been working.  Would I be eligible to claim money from my super ? Not sure if this meets the criteria.
