 Update on bets I've been asked a few times to post an update on how my bets are coming along. They're coming along very well, thanks! It took me so long to post an update because there are so many.

Anyway, below is an update. I've included a few COVID-related bets I've made off reddit, these are the ones marked \[redacted]\ for who my opponent is.

-----

Resolved bets/agreements:

1. $100 with \[redacted\] in April over "iceberg theory" - whether NYC serology testing
   would show there was a large number of asymptomatic infections and thus that the IFR
   was low and COVID was NBD. I bet against iceberg theory, and my opponent paid up.

2. $20 with \[redacted\] in July over whether Sydney would lock down after being
   re-infected by Melbourne. I bet they would not, and my opponent paid up.

3. $20 with /u/Wildweasel666 over whether VIC will make its original Oct 26 targets.
   [link](
   Declared a draw, since we did not make the mysteries requirement in a 2-day delayed
   14d window, though we did make it in a non-delayed window, and we didn't specify in
   the original bet whether the delayed window would be the basis for the bet.

4. $15 at 2:1 (i.e I get $30 if I win or pay $15 if I lose) with /u/BolamSchmolam on
   whether the 14d average would be ≤ 5 on Oct 26th.
   [link](
   I bet it would be, and /u/BolamSchmolam and I have agreed to settle payment at the
   end of the year when our other two bets have resolved.

5. /u/jamespv87 offered to pay $50 to a charity of my choice if VIC had ≤ 5 cases per
   day 14d average by Oct 26th.
   [link](
   /u/jamespv87 has made a donation to the Against Malaria Foundation and will send me a
   receipt (I originally requested a different charity but agreed to choose one with
   Australian tax-deductible status).


----

Unresolved bets/agreements:

1. $100 with /u/thehungryhippocrite over whether there will be No new local cases for 28
   days and no local active cases at some point before March 1st 2021.
   [link](

2. $20 with \[redacted\] over whether someone in metro Melbourne will be allowed to visit
   family in regional VIC for Christmas.

3. Odds of 1 bottle of wine:1 admission of being wrong with /u/margheria that if
   Australia gets 28 days without local cases and has no active cases, it will have no
   local cases for the subsequent 28 days as well (I am betting that it will).[link](
   

4. $30 with /u/BolamSchmolam that VIC will have no local COVID cases in the last 28 days
   of December.
   [link](
   [link to increasing the stake to
   $30](

5. $10 with /u/GeorgeHackenschmidt that VIC will have no local COVID in the last 28 days
   of December.
   [link](
   
6. $10 at 3:1 (i.e I get $30 if I win, I pay $10 if I lose) with /u/GeorgeHackenschmidt
   over whether Andrews will step down as Premier by March 1st 2021 (I am betting he
   will not).
   [link](

7. A pizza order up to $50 with /u/wiggycj/ that 60% of Australians will be vaccinated
   against COVID by June 30th 2021 (I'm betting they will be).
   [link](

8. A bet for pizza with /u/OMG_Alien over whether there will be 14d with no local cases
   in VIC this year. [link](

9. $20 with /u/EndlessB over whether there will a month with no local cases in VIC prior
   to Jan 7th. [link](

10. $20 with /u/brunz1995 over whether we will get 14d of zero local cases in VIC by Nov
    30th. [link](

11. $20 with /u/BolamSchmolam over there being no local cases in VIC from 17-30 November
    inclusive. [link](

12. A beer from /u/SS_Carpathia (I have not staked anything) if we get 14d of no local
    cases in VIC by Nov 26th. [link](

Yesterday I posted a [press release]( from the NSW Government, as I usually do.  It was about the new $10 million grants program to assist women to get back into the workplace.  To my surprise, some viewed this grant as unfair, and a cause for *gender inequality*.  My mind was blown.

For me, this raises several questions that I’d love to start a civil discussion about:  
1. When you hear the phrase ‘gender equality’ what comes to mind?  
2. Does gender inequality still exist today?  
3. Have you, yourself, experienced, or witnessed someone else experiencing gender inequality?

**Some very funny and relatable answers from that thread include:**
