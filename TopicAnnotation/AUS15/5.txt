 Pro tip on how to not get abused while wearing a mask: wear a cloth or handkerchief over the mask. I have not gotten abused since I started doing this as no one thinks that I am wearing a legitimate medical mask.

 Medical professionals need to set an example and take the lead - wear masks and practice social distancing! Went to a GP this morning in Melbourne. Most staffs including doctors are not wearing masks. Those wearing them are not doing it properly. After that at Chemist Warehouse the same. Only 1-2 wearing masks. Nobody practices social distancing - customers or staffs. Coming from an Asian country where we managed to flatten the curve, this is incredible. Not sure if I should laugh or cry. Those that say masks don’t work, please take a look at China, HK, Singapore, South Korea and tell me what’s in common among them that managed the outbreak much better. Individuals each taking responsibility by wearing masks and keeping their distance. Medical professionals please start to set an example to others!!

 I have many masks and surgical masks. Who should I contact? Hello everyone! 

I'm Chinese. We are a mask factory in China. We really hope our products can help you. We have a large number of disposable masks and surgical masks. I learned from my friends that there is a shortage of masks in many parts of the world.

We now have 200,000 disposable and surgical masks.

Medical surgical mask, bfe &gt; = 95%, conforms to Chinese yy0469-2011 medical mask standard, yy0469-2011 is very similar to FFP2.

But I'm not sure who I should contact. If you need a lot, please contact me. My email address is 2160210880@qq.com

 Nursing Home Staff Not Wearing Masks My mother's nursing home in Sydney is not insisting staff wear masks. Some workers there don't realise you don't need to display symptoms to be infected and contagious. 

Is it impossible to have them legally forced by authorities to wear masks?

The average age of death from COV-19 in Italy is 81 so not wearing masks in a home here seems extremely negligent.
