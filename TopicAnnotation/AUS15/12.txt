 I’ve received two Job Seeker payments this month. On the 27th I will receive my first Job Keeper payment, which will included backdated pay to March 30th. Will I owe Centrelink all or just some of the Job Seeker payments I’ve received so far? 

My Job Seeker payment claim was submitted on the 24th of March and I received my first payment of $574.50 on the 7th of April and another yesterday, the 21st. 

The company I work for (which is currently closed) has had their Job Keeper application approved and I am due to receive my first payment on the 27th of April, which will be a lump sum including back payments from March 30th. 

I’m mainly wondering if I will owe Centrelink the full amount they have paid to me so far, or if I will just owe them a fraction of it. 

I was also wondering if I should report this to them through the “report my income” system on the app, or if this particular situation is too complex for the system and I’m better off talking to a human?

Also, will I need to have my Job Seeker payment cancelled immediately by formally cancelling it with them over the phone, or can I report my Job Keeper payments through the app and this will notify them of my income change so that the Job Seeker payment will terminate itself automatically?

Thanks! :)

 Centrelink Supplementary Payment Hey all, I've lost my job due to the coronavirus &amp; had applied &amp; been accepted for the Centrelink Job Seeker payment. My first payment though is $530 due to be paid on the 9th of April. 

Does anyone know how to access the extra $550 as I had the understanding that it was automatically added to the current payments.
Do I have to select anything in particular with Centrelink or is that just the first payment &amp; then they fortnightly payments after that will be the $1100?

Any help would be much appreciated.

 [NoDumbQuestions] Tax on Jobseeker/Jobkeeper Do you get taxed on the government payments you receive during corona? Or even just in general? 

For example, if you receive 750 a week, does that mean you’ll get taxed for it like normal income? (E.g. 15% for over 18k annual income)

 Has anyone received the initial $750 stimulus payment. My understanding is that if you are already receiving and payment and are eligible to receive this stimulus package there is no further action required however it was documented on the Aus government website that the payment would be made on 31st of March. Just wanted to touch base to see if anyone had received it.

 As suspected, the Job Keeper back-payment will result in a Centrelink debt for those who were on/are on the Job Seeker payment. If you received an initial lump sum Job Keeper payment and had been receiving a Centrelink payment (i.e. Job Seeker) before that, please read this!

Hi all. Just got off the phone to Centrelink as I received my first Job Keeper payment yesterday evening, which was a lump sum back-paid to the 30th of March.

Because I was receiving the Centrelink Job Seeker payment during the period of time I was back-paid to, I will essentially owe Centrelink all of that money back. My debt is being processed now (it has been sent to the debt recovery team to finalise and will be available for me to begin paying off at some point in the near future).

I was informed that everyone in my situation (everyone who was receiving a Centrelink payment and then received an initial lump sum of Job Keeper to cover back-payments) will receive a debt from Centrelink. 

The only difference being is if you simply report your lump sum payment through the app, you won’t receive the debt until a later date as the system will audit you and compare the income reported against information from the ATO at some point down the track.

If you would rather receive your debt sooner than later so you can get it out of the way, you can call Centrelink to report your lump sum Job Keeper payment over the phone.

The Centrelink employee recommended that calling up to report the lump sum would be the best way to go about it as just reporting it through the app could possibly incur fees/interest.

I figured I would be in debt to Centrelink as soon as I heard the Job Keeper payment was to be back-paid, but called Centrelink several times in the past week and was told that I would not be receiving a debt. I doubted this, so kept calling, and was finally able to get a solid answer after receiving my first Job Keeper payment.

 Does anyone know how sub-contracted casual employees will get paid if they have a set roster and they’ve been told they can’t come into work for two weeks? Would like to know how a casual employee of an big business agency that is contracted to send employees to various locations that has a set roster will get paid? 
Will they get paid for the hours that have been set out that they approved to work? 
What will happen?

I doubted this, so kept calling, and was finally able to get a solid answer after receiving my first Job Keeper payment. 

The Centrelink employee advised that everyone who has been receiving Centrelink payments and now has received their first Job Keeper payment from their employer should...

1) Call up Centrelink to report your lump sum Job Keeper back-payment. You won’t be able to accurately report this on the app, which is why simply reporting it through the app may incur fees as it would be misinformation due to the limitations of the app. The back-payment is to the 30th of a March, and it simply won’t be possible to enter this in the app, because you would’ve already reported your earnings for most of March. The reason you must call is that they need to make an adjustments to your previous reported incomes.

2) Stay on your Centrelink payment and just report every Job Keeper from now onwards as income through the app. I chose to not do this, and instead just cancelled my Job Seeker payment. It’s up to you whether or not you’d like to stay in the Centrelink system. If you do decide to stay, you’ll be able to use your health care card as long as you’re still in the system. 

3) Wait to receive a letter that will advise you of your debt and the amount, and then either pay it in full or set up a payment plan with Centrelink. These can be pretty lax, I believe you can even go as low as paying off $10/fortnight. The debt will not be every cent you’ve received from Centrelink since March 30th to whichever day you received your Job Keeper back-payment, but it will be most of it. During that period of time I received $1,149 in Job Seeker payments and my debt to them is $1,011. As fast as I’m aware, the $750 one-time stimulus payment will not incur a debt and is not included in this.

Hope this helps! :)

 Job keeper payment!? Do you have to go to work to receive the job keeper payment? My boss closed down but is considering reopening so we can get the job keeper payment. Can we still get the payment if shes closed??

 I’m on the Job Seeker payment but I am about to start receiving the Job Keeper payment from my employer. Should I cancel my Job Seeker payment, or should I just report my Job Keeper payment as income on the Centrelink app? I’m on the Job Seeker payment but I’m due to start receiving the Job Keeper payments from my employer. Should I cancel my Job Seeker payment, either through the MyGov website or on the phone with Centrelink, or report my new income (the Job Keeper payments) through the Centrelink app, and do nothing more than that?

On one of my previous posts I speculated that people in the same boat as me (were on/are on Job Seeker and have started/are about to start receiving Job Keeper) may end up owing Centrelink money due to the back payment you’ll likely receive in your first Job Keeper payment. Has anyone looked into this further, and found out whether or not we will be in debt to Centrelink due to this backpay?
