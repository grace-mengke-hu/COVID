 What's the reasoning behind Scott Morrison and co constantly referring to ALL forms of social distancing (including shutdowns) that will need to take place for at LEAST 6 months? Can someone please please explain to me why a 6-month lockdown of society in stage 3 is necessary???? That's all they keep sprouting is "any form of social distancing will need to be applied for 6 months, that includes any form of Shutdown" Scott Morrison

No country in the world has gone on lockdown for +6 months and would be stupid to do it. The virus is incredibly bad, but if they pull a 6+ month lockdown you'll get more domestic violence, more suicide, possibly crime relating to arson or breaking into closed stores. Then there's also other issues relating to mental health and then obviously the economy and it's a significant hit.

Yes the virus is bad, but any country needing to go on a six-month lockdown would create a whole range of problems bigger than the impact of this virus. 2 weeks up to 2 months I can understand, but 6 months? Can anyone provide some extent to why the government is thinking this? 

I know we are behind a few countries, but China took nearly 2 months to reopen some provinces, US reckon they're reopening non-essential trade within a month. I don't see where this data is coming from to suggest we need to have a 6-month society lockdown. Surely people are worried about this??? From what I'm reading most of the general public online would be okay with a six-month lockdown of society. I can understand if we've had 1000+ deaths, but we haven't. We've had under 10 deaths, and only about 20 people have required serious treatment. 2000+ in mild/no symptom condition and only 11 in serious condition. Yet, our government is bringing in these measures every 2nd day, completely grilling the public and not even waiting 2 weeks (when results will show if they're working). Yes, we will see increases in deaths etc, but wouldn't announce a 6-Month lockdown creates fear and panic? We've already seen supermarket panic buying, imagine a 6- month society lockdown. Is it fear-mongering or what? Because, he keeps referring to it, and most likely he will let this happen.

 High Risk Young Aussies - Should we start trying to self-isolate? Coming from a family of several high risk Aussies (autoimmune disorders - immune systems suppressed in response), including myself, I'm starting to worry quite a bit that a spread through the family could hurt us badly.

Seeing as the government seems to be dangerously inept, should we be trying to take leave from our own commitments?

i.e. I'm expected to attend tutorials in the main building of my university at the end of this week, walking through some packed areas. I can afford not to attend, however it will increase my workload through undesirable group placement with other no-shows, and using one of two allowed attendance weekly assessment misses (ie they take the top 8 of 10 tute scores).

One family member works in a school, they are older, have a very weakened immune system, but are still expected to show up and interact with over a hundred kids per day.

 A childcare centre in Sydney’s north-west, where a cluster of coronavirus cases have been confirmed in recent days, has ramped up its screening measures by checking the temperature of anyone who enters, and banning entry to anyone with a temperature over 37.8 degrees   [ 

A childcare centre in Sydney’s north-west, where a cluster of coronavirus cases have been confirmed in recent days, has ramped up its screening measures.

Staff at Kids Planet Academy are checking the temperatures of everyone who enters the facility and banning entry of anyone with a temperature over 37.8 degrees.

The centre’s director, Alex Guan, said the measure which began on Monday was a necessary precaution.

“There have been incidents very close to us. Our parents have concerns as well. By putting out this procedure we want to ensure our centre is protected, particularly our children. We want to take the top level of caution.” he told The Australian.

Mr Guan, who is also a parent of children at the centre, said the facility’s procedures were likely to be the strictest in the region.

“I’m pretty worried, especially now that the schools have been closed.”

The centre is asking any students with symptoms of the virus or a temperature to stay home and get clearance from their doctor.

The Australian Childcare Alliance’s NSW Branch says all childcare centres already have in place strict infectious disease protocols.

 Has anyone had a text like this about their result? Not sure how to interpret it- if it means I need to be re-tested, I quit!

 Thoughts on the quarantine enquiry Whilst I haven't been following it closely enough to know all the details it seems fairly obvious that one of the biggest issues is no one person seems to be in charge. (Same with curfew). 

The State of Emergency provides the Chief Health Officer with additional powers to issue directions to help contain the spread however it was decided he was too busy with public appearances to cover everything and this created a vacuum of responsibility with Andrews believing Mikakos was responsible, Mikakos thinking someone else was and Sutton on the sidelines.

When complex decisions are being in short time frames you can't have this ambiguity which is why we have formal procedures such as the  Public Health and Wellbeing Act, however these procedures weren't followed.

The fact that it was deemed more important for the Chief Health Officer (and Premier) to give press conferences than deal with the management of the infection is to me much more important than finding out who we should blame for using private security or ADF especially when there's very little evidence this decision would have made much difference

 As an Aussie citizen, can I leave to visit my sick cousin (non-Australian) living in another country? Hi all,

My cousin resides in India and he is very sick (non-covid related). The doctors have given him a less than 30% chance of survival.

I know you can only leave for immediate family members (i.e. spouse or de facto partner or kids) and also based on this: 

I may only be able to use the "compassionate" reason.

Has anyone gone through this sort of situation? Were you given an exemption and were you able to come back to the country within 15-25 days?

I know I will have to pay for hotel quarantine etc which I am okay to do.

Thank you for any insights or help!

 Banana bending - Queensland actually sees unemployment fall in June, bucking every other state Queensland, on top of having no new cases for some time, and nice weather, has actually seen unemployment fall May to June, in stark contrast to every other state.

Knock on wood and all that, and it may be half luck, but AP must be a shoe-in at this point.
