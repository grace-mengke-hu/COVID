 A B testing the behavioural science behind understanding diseases With the behavioural scientists taking quite a public lead in this (the UCL lady, Dr mgee or something and Dr Halpern) remembered I listened to this the other day about AB testing and infectious diseases, and how simulations inform a lot of academic understanding in the area - including war craft game play! Anyway if you're interested:

The figures for care home are for those who died in hospital before june 12th 2020 and their death was  registered by June 20th. So its possible that more numbers may be added at a future date. I will update if figures are updated and timeline extended. 

There were 4810 who died with primary residence the care home and were registered by these dates. They make up 15.5% of all hospital covid-19 related deaths over this time and they make up 24.8% of care home residents who died with virus over this timeline

 Received home tests this morning, only to find they're useless. I've been feeling pretty sick since friday evening. So following the latest advice, I ordered a home test kit for myself (I can't get to a test centre) and also 1 for my daughter as it said that everyone in my household needed to be tested even if they are asymptomatic.

The tests arrived this morning, delivered by Amazon, but there was no instructions and no Royal Mail sticker/barcode so no way to register it online or send it back to them. Both tests had the same problem. I called the Coronavirus hotline and was told that due to there being no return label, the tests were considered null and void.

They are sending me another test within the next 48 hours, but the rules have since changed and my daughter can no longer have a test as she is not showing symptoms.

The following quote is taken from an article I found [HERE](

&gt; In the case of the UK’s home-testing programme, as of June 3 – the most  recent date the health department has provided figures for – only 62% of  the kits were returned to labs. The department told Reuters it was  consulting with leading behavioural science experts to help improve  return rates.  

This makes me wonder how many tests have been sent out to people with the same problem as both of mine. What use are behavioural science experts when we can't send the tests back to them?

Here is what I got in my kit:
