 Self isolated with symptoms - need advice Sorry if not the place to post but with no idea who to contact or if there’s anything I can do was hoping someone might have an idea here.

I started showing symptoms yesterday, immediately self isolated and now just staying at home.

At the weekend I saw my 87 year old gran and my 84 year old grandad, who has serious asthma, bronchiectasis and I think COPD.

Is there anything I can do, can I get tested to confirm or rule out that I have covid to see if I could have given them it? Can they be tested? I know everything is so stretched but I have to try and do something as I’m so worried that if I have it I’ve given it to them. 

Any advice would be super appreciated

 Someone fucking spat in my face... What's the incubation period and when would be the earliest that a test could detect infection? Current stats for Barry (Wales) would be helpful I think I'm still in shock to be honest but whilst driving today some absolute knuckle dragging bellend pulled out of a sideroad on me. I stopped in time to avoid a collision and held my upturned hands up as if to say 'what the fuck was that'. That seemed enough to trigger him into getting out of his car and start shouting shit through my open window before spitting at me as I started to drive off. Most of it seemed to hit the B pillar but I still felt spray on my arm &amp; forehead and upon chasing a police car down nearby to report it, I found splatters on my sunglasses too. 

I'm obviously going to get tested but I don't know when it would first become detectable with or without symptoms. Also knowing the infection rate in Barry would give me some insight into how at risk I could be.

 My doctors are now pre-screening patients via survey Just had this text from my local doctors surgery:

*Due to concerns of Coronavirus and under guidance of Public Health England, we are screening patients before they come in to the practice via the link below.*

This linked to a survey:
Have you been out of the country in the last 14 days?

Have you had contact with a confirmed case - included being coughed on by them, how would you know if someone you were fighting for loo roll last weekend had an infectious cough?

Do you have symptoms?

Thought this was a good idea but not sure how they plan to involve the massive percentage of their elderly patients who won’t be able to access this.
