 Wife's friend has coronavirus. Friend's sister wants to visit with kids to catch it My wife's friend has symptoms of coronavirus.

Is there anything I should do e.g. call non emergency police number?

 Am I being unreasonable? We have accumulated a home gym during lockdown. My brother now wants to invite his friend over to use the weights. They attend group gatherings together at the local park (since the new relaxations), and I am not ok with this, despite protestations of ‘I’ll clean everything’! as he fails to do so in all other areas. The friend is nice, other family members seem very relaxed, but I am still not convinced; I think this will lead to a false perception that things are back to normal, which is (in my opinion) a big problem. I think a relaxation of attitudes such as this will lead us to a second wave. 

Brother is a nice guy, but pretty spoilt, 19, and usually high. Does not reassure me of his eye for detail.

Tell me your thoughts.

 Will the COVID vaccine in the UK be a DNA-altering vaccine or a normal vaccine?

 Furlough Scheme and Restaurants Reopening Hi everyone, I have a question regarding the furlough scheme and how hospitality employee pay packets should now look if their establishments have reopened.

I work in a really busy restaurant as a hostess since October 2019 but as I also study and I took time off around Christmas, my hours were really inconsistent (i.e. one week it would be 25 hours, the next 8 hours - particularly in the lead up to lockdown). I therefore did not question the amount I received for furlough even though it was a really small amount. 

My issue, however, is this: we reopened on Saturday 4th July but for the next 2-3 weeks the owners have said we are being kept on furlough pay. I am also being asked to do around 26 hours per week which is waaaaaay above the average used to calculate my furlough (80% of roughly between 11 to 12 hours). I wanted to know whether, after reopening, employers had to asap come off the furlough scheme and pay their workers in line with normal pay? Even if this is the case, I think this is really unfair to ask that I do this many hours for less than £100.

Wanted to hear your thoughts on this - thank you!

 How are your schools handling home learning? Our school is asking for suggestions for improving Home Learning during Coronavirus, and I wondered what other people's schools are doing.

My child is in Year 1. The school gives us a weekly home learning timetable with lots of activities, links to online learning resource pages, which is supposed to take up half of every weekday. But it's all one way. They don't mark the work or talk to the kids on Zoom. I find the lack of feedback a problem. I don't know what constitutes good handwriting for that age or whether I should be pushing harder in maths.

I worry because I don't think my mother wants enough and they definitely don't get enough nutrients. I wanted to take some cooked meals over alone with fruit and veg, and house necessities.

 Dutch Government joins the cowardly British Government - "Herd Immunity" I don't have a new article, I'll find one soon but suffice it to say that in announcement by Dutch PM one hour ago, he is giving up on defeating the virus to extremely low, manageable with surveillance levels like China, Korea and several other countries are doing.

Instead, just like the British government, he wants to keep it away from the vulnerable and let it infect everyone else to give herd immunity. Of course, instead of spending money on vaccines this will only cost the blood of a couple hundred thousand people probably.

Outrageous. I look forward to seeing the 14 day quarantine controls between these coward countries (and whoever else wants to join them) and Asia.

 For those that can, should we be keeping our kids out of school? To be clear, I'm not talking about Police, Doctors, Nurses, etc?

I'm referring to parents or carers that are otherwise healthy and in non-critical jobs and are able to work from home.

It would be very easy to phone the school on Monday and say that our kids have "developed a cough".

I can think of several pros (some of which may be over-reacting), but I can't think of many cons (other than the inconvenience and potential boredom if the parents have to work whilst the kids are in the house).

 Independent SAGE committee - politically biased? I hope I don't get my head ripped off straight away here.

I am a parent agonising as whether it is safe to send my child to school in June.  I don't know a lot about politics but know that nearly everyone with something to say about COVID has vested interests somewhere or other.

The government's SAGE committee says it's safe.  I understand that they are appointed by the government and therefore may be biased towards the governments aims of opening the country back up again.

But what about the Independent SAGE committee?  Their scientific backgrounds seem good, but have they been selected based on any political leaning, that could influence their assessments?

Thanks for any insight.

 12 week isolation and schools Can anyone help give me direction with this.

I want to say firstly. This really isn’t as simple as just taking my kids out of school, that kind of action cannot be taken lightly, even in these extreme circumstances.

So I am 35, single parent to 3 kids aged 5, 7 and 9. My eldest has a diagnosis of autism and an eating disorder called ARFID. My youngest is currently seeing a wealth of professionals for assessment. They believe she has autism and ADHD, but this isn’t formally diagnosed yet. Their school is incredible and for my 2 with extra needs, routine is VITAL.

I am high risk. I would be high risk with just regular asthma but I have a rare and severe style of asthma called type 1 brittle asthma. It’s volatile and difficult to control. I do also have a weak immune system and am on immunosuppressant meds. So yeah, I really truly am high risk.

Yesterday they announced that from this weekend people who are high risk will be asked to self isolate for 12 weeks. This is explained as vital because if people like me do not take all measures to prevent infection, we are the people who will cripple the NHS. It’s not just about how I feel about my own risk and health but on the impact my illness will have on the situation in the U.K.

There is zero point in me self isolating if my kids are continuing to bring home 3 separate classes worth of germs home from school every day. 

I can only assume right now that this self isolation has to include my kids as well but I am not comfortable at all taking such severe action for THEM without some concrete guidance that actually officially says that THIS is what parents in my situation HAVE to do. 12 weeks is huge for them. To be out of school, out of routine, isolated from friends, isolated from activities etc etc. 

Now, I know that in time schools will close anyway but that doesn’t help me NOW. 

Has anyone seen anything official yet that covers this issue? Does anyone know who I can call and ask it to? I spoke to both head teachers this morning who were sympathetic but didn’t even realise that this 12 week covered such a big group of people and how many parents will be in my predicament right now. They know no more than I do.

I just need someone official to say that YES, kids will have to be out of school for 12 weeks if the parent is self isolating.

Please help

 Disappointed with friends. I dropped a few subtle hints on Facebook weeks ago and did not go 'John the Baptist'. All my comments were ignored.

These idiots cannot wait to spread it around. I am disappointed in them. Although a Pandemic has not happened since 1918 you would think that with social media sense would prevail. Its all memes and jokes. People are mocked for preparing now people are mocked for panic buying. 

I know its a denial stage but these are people who I thought would be sensible and clear headed and see this thing as serious. One of my friends has a father who is a doctor.

Personally I have plenty of food and toilet rolls. I have prepared for the lock-downs should they happen. Its not like there is a pandemic every 5 years its a once in a 100 years event.

Perhaps the Italian lock-down will wake them  up a bit. I doubt it.

 Doubts over Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine Doubts are mounting over the data that Oxford/AstraZeneca put out, how they have presented it, and the quality of the trial considering that it was an error that led to some trial participants getting half a dose first time round. 

The small patriotic part in me wants to defend the OX/AZ vaccine and tell the critics to stuff it, but actually, the more I look at it objectively, the criticism seems quite valid and fair. Imagine if the dosage had been double what it should have been, for example? It’s not very professional. 

That said, it appears that it was a very fortunate mistake to make, but what with OX/AZ admitting that they don’t know why half a dose followed by a full dose seems to be best practise for this vaccine, then surely this needs to be investigated and tested further before submitting it for approval? I haven’t heard of any further tests planned (based on the half dose/full 2nd dose) - surely they will start conducting further trials around this? 

I feel sorry for the incredibly hardworking team at Oxford - they must be pretty gutted that confidence in their vaccine has been undermined by the pharmaceutical partner they picked, although at the same time probably pleased to have stumbled across this result. That said, I think they’ve also been a little naive in how they’ve presented the data.

My concern is that we will lose confidence in what appears to be a very good vaccine, that it will get lost in the noise, and therefore it won’t win the regulators approval, and therefore it won’t be available on the market. 

Here’s hoping they can demonstrate that the 1/2 dose followed by a full dose isn’t just a statistical anomaly and that the vaccine does indeed make it to the market - not just for the UK but for developing nations as well, who need this vaccine to be a success.

 I still don’t know how vulnerable I am I never got a doctors call or a letter or anything for ages. It took me ringing up the doctors over and over and then having to explain to them why I am vulnerable. I’ve got a genetic condition that causes air sacs to grow on my lungs, if they pop they can collapse (which happened when I was 22) I’ve had 2 operations to stick my lungs to my chest so they can’t collapse again. But the thing is I’ve got 100% lung capacity and I have no problem breathing. I feel the same as I did before the operation. I am a fit and healthy 26 year old. I’m just so confused about how vulnerable I am? My doctors have been useless, like shouldn’t they be telling me and not me telling them? I’ve had no texts from the government or my doctors I just feel left in the cold. 

My brother and dad are also on the list. My brother got sent home by the doctor but again questioned him on why he thought he was vulnerable. Which to me made no sense since he sent him home. He on the other hand has not had the operations. But I see this as a greater risk than me as his could collapse if the air sacs were to pop. My dad is the worst. He’s had parts of his lungs removed so he doesn’t have as much capacity only 50%. So am I even vulnerable or not as vulnerable? It seems to be you either are vulnerable or your not.

Just wondering if anyone else is in a similar situation and what they're doing, or just general advice is welcome.

 UK govt could do this right now, to make sure every person in the UK can get food today, not 2 - 3 - 5 weeks time. I have just finishing watching sky news at 7pm. In that news report, it painted a frightening picture of what is happening in southern Italy right now. 

It shows scenes of desperate parents begging police for food for their children. It then showed further scenes of looming organized looting &amp; threats of violence &amp; chaos over the supply of food.

WE DON'T WANT THAT HERE, WE NEED THE GOVT TO ACT

Here is my idea. Remember the text message that the govt sent out the other day, that every single mobile phone in the country got.
Well the govt could send another text out again to every single mobile phone, but this time the message could have a bar code, that would be valued at say £50.00 redeemable at all supermarkets, for food &amp; food alone, no alcohol, no tobacco etc. 

The retailers scan the bar code, deducting the amount spent, etc.

Then this following week the govt send another barcode, and so on, etc...

To give some background, I will have one son starting Y7 and other son in Y8
It’s bad enough that my youngest is going to be going up without any transition in place. Both sons have health conditions, so have some requirements. These aren’t massive in the sense they can’t be implemented. But I had issues with my eldest being allowed to go to the toilet and sometimes needing time to get up and stretch.

Both my sons would be attending school on a school bus. So how would they keep pupils separate? They all crowd together at the bus stop. 
They all the queue up at end of day.
Buses are quite often packed.

School itself has around 1600 students. Not sure if those numbers include the 6th form they have.

 Thoughts on this situation? A friend on FB recently had a test due to having symptoms. She took her kids out of school immediately, informed the school why and informed when negative result was returned. She no longer had symptoms either.
The school requested proof of her result to be sent electronically.
She refused, stating that she would rather show them in person. She has previously sent things electronically that have been lost. She also stated she did not feel comfortable with school having NHS number and DOB and not knowing where/how long info would be stored. She also added that gov guidelines state it is not a legal requirement to provide proof.
The school therefore refused to allow children back, but were saying the absence would be unauthorised.
