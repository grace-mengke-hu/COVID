 What's the situation in the preston area? There's been two confirmed cases in south ribble, very near where I live. I've heard whispers that there's more, but the official news is 2. 

It's been a pretty awful flu season so far, i've already had flu and 2 colds so far, so I considered it very unlikely i'd get another one this year, but I seem to be getting another.

It's very mild, but i've been a little short of breath and headachy.

It's almost certainly NOT coronavirus, but should I stay home for a bit anyway? In part so my friends/classmates don't freak out as everyones been... (over?)reacting and they said if there's any suspicions they will close classes. I really, REALLY don't want that to happen, we have major end of year projects due in the next few weeks.

ANyone know if there's any truth to the rumours of coronavirus being in preston?

 I work in a care home in East London, shouldn't government advice be all staff should be wearing masks?! Also can't get delivery slots.. Im a caretaker at quite a large care home and I shudder to think that at some point if not already one of the 60 staff has brought this in. It will go through the home like wild fire they are all so vulnerable most of them in bed. No government advice to wear masks yet?. Fair enough they want to save the supply of masks by telling general public its not necessary to wear them but in a care home surely we should be at the very least. We are cleaning non stop and have had no visitor policy for nearly two weeks now but how can we know we are not infected?. We are taking temps of all staff and residents twice a day but this is not an indicator of if you are harbouring the virus. The other major issue we are having is only two Tesco deliveries are booked till next week and cannot get anymore slots after that on top of this we cannot order more than two or three items and are again tarred with the same brush as the general public in this respect. we need to be top of the list for Tesco delivery slots and have the 3 item only rule lifted otherwise its trips to Tesco for us and risk of getting infected and passing it on.... Sorry for the long moaning post but I cannot understand the government neglecting to help the most vulnerable or to give the most basic advice to wear masks in care homes.

 I have to rant. I'm so down about it all :( I must admit I'm pretty riled up by this Coronavirus government shambles/ shitshow.

I doubt any political party would of handled the situation well, no one is trained for this. 

I'm not a fan of Boris Johnson personally. 

Having to just sit back and watch it happen/unfold, so the past few days: 

**Cummings and the other MPs who broke the rules.** 

It's our 'civic duty' apparently to us this Track and Trace. I'd say it's the governments duty to lead by example. Why should we all continue to make sacrifices, when you won't sacrifice your puppet master. 

As well as Sir Keir Starmer who says he'd of sacked Cummings, but you haven't got rid of you two elected MP's - Stephen Kinnock and Tahir Ali who also broke the rules...

Johnson has caused a dangerous backlash and undermined the public health message which has now resulted in even more people floating the rules, so don't we shouldn't be surprised if the cases creep back up again right? 

**Track and Trace -** 

I'm personally very skeptical on this track and trace app, clearly it's the way forward to get us out of this but there are still a lot of unanswered questions. 

People cannot afford to be ill or self isolate (and repeatedly) and I'm talking track and trace here. Being paid sick pay £95 a week for low income people and families, people aren't going to survive. I know furlough can't last forever, some companies can't afford to pay out of their own pocket. 

Who's paying for peoples mortgage bills after a 3rd 14 day isolation period.... after they've already used their 3 month mortgage break...

Someones sick at work, all self isolate until you get a negative test... go back to work, someone else gets sick, repeat and repeat.. seriously.

The political elite have no clue about the real world or lives of the working people.

My points being and if anyone can enlighten me (I'd be really grateful) 

**Bluetooth? connecting to everyones phones you come in contact with right?** 

1) Your phone - what if your not allowed your phone on you/ near you while working/serving customers? Say you work in the Retail/ Hospitality sector. You can't stay 2 metres away from staff and customers in certain circumstances. 

2) Production - again the same not allowed your phone on or near you say Food Production. So that means everyone in your business has to self isolate if one person is sick for 14 days - affecting your business, delivery drivers... etc. 

3) Are we going to be put on sick pay if we're told to self isolate? What is it £95 a week... how are low income people/families going to survive on that? 

4) After the 14 days you all return to work, go about your working life a week later.. say another staff member falls ill who you've been in contact with again - because they got it off some family member or whatever so do we all have to self isolate again? Get tested again, and Repeat &amp; Repeat...

5) Schools - if one kid gets ill does that mean the whole school or class isolates, as well as the families... Also Not many young kids have phones to be tracked on or be allowed to have them on them. 

Sounds like a pickle to me...

Any thoughts?

Sorry for rambling! Thanks for reading though!

 By trying to save the elderly, we render many fo their lives no longer worth living. This whole lockdown, and the public's zealous support of it, is built on a seemingly compassionate need to save the old and vulnerable, which to a degree I understand. However, we may well end up ruining more lives than we save. 

The pandemic of loneliness amongst the elderly and its profound effects on mental health is extremely well documented, and what is this whole situation doing if not making it worse? 

They are projected to be legally bound to self isolation until we find a vaccine, which likely won't be readily available until next year at least. What are many of the elderly going to do until then? At least many of us younger people live with our families, whether that's with our parents or a family we started ourselves, but for most of the elderly this simply isn't the case. They live alone, and much of their joy comes from seeing extended family and friends. That is what makes life worth living, and they are now completely deprived of it for the foreseeable future. Considering many don't know how long they have left to live, this seems like a terrifying proposition.

So you're end up caught in this position where people feel virtuous and self righteous about "saving lives", when in reality, it's their dogmatic support of the lockdown which will end up condemning many people's final days to loneliness and misery. 
Yes, you may well save lives, but at what cost? In the process, you void many others of any meaning or joy. 

And what sort of life is that?

 We can't relax the lockdown There is no way that we can relax this lockdown, not now anyway. What we need is a stricter quarantine - something akin to the Italian or Spanish model, for the foreseeable future.


At present, the inept Tory government is mishandling every single aspect of this pretend lockdown. There is no doubt that the numbers are being fiddled with to push their agenda of money over people.


Their failures with furlough, with PPE, with the lockdown enforcement, all of these have bloodied Boris' hands. The inquiry after this whole thing ends in a few years will be monumental, and a chance for the sane people of this nation to take back control of the country. 


We need to give the police more powers, especially right now. A lot of non-essential travel is happening at the minute and all of our progress is going down the drain. There needs to be a media push for using the 101 police hotline as well to maintain the lockdown. The law needs to be clear - fines are not enough. 


This pandemic has an incredibly high mortality rate, far higher than any government would tell you, this will wipe out the peoples of Europe like the Black Death, if not worse. All the actual science (not the government's shoddy nudge programme) points to this. 


Everyone needs to stay inside, stay safe, only go out for the bare minimum. Go out in your garden with your household, but no more. People shouldn't be complaining! You get paid to stay at home, there's nothing wrong with that. If you are so selfish that you can't care for your fellow human beings then I've nothing else to say.

 Vets, pets and social distancing. Few days ago, our old dog needed emergency dental work, suspected broken molar and she was in pain and distress This was our experience: 

**Vet 1 (our independent vet):**

Free telephone consultation. Operation and general anesthesia could only be done once social distancing relaxed (in 3-4 weeks hopefully). Pain relief would be offered in the meantime. 

**Vet 2:** (we wanted a second opinion with our local **Practice chain, 3 branches**) 

£25 for the telephone consultation. He agreed to assess her. He came out of the surgery wearing full PPE and with full Perspex face protector. He took our terrified dog into the surgery from the car-park, the handover was like a secret drug deal. We had to wait in our car for the phone call and assessment. 4 minutes later, he called and said she would not open her mouth for him but he guessed there was no infection and booked in an operation in 6 days (earliest free time slot) even though he hadn’t even seen or assessed the problem. Cost estimate £450 to £650 depending on the (unknown) complexity. He then returned our dog in the car-park with pain relief medication.

**Vet 3:** (we wanted a third opinion with **Franchised chain** which we had never used before)

Receptionist told us to come in right away, but only one of us would be allowed into the waiting/reception area. I had to sit 2 meters from the vet (business owner), she had no PPE. 15 minute chat like normal humans and she was fussing over our sore girl the whole time. She and a nurse then took her for a 10 minute examination. Confirmed the molar had cracked down the middle and it was infected too, but all the other teeth were in good shape. Another 15 minute chat, given detailed quote (£323) and she was booked in for her operation the next morning. 

**Conclusion:**  

3 vets in the same town all had very different practices on the social distancing rules. If you find yourself in the same position, please don’t settle for the first diagnosis in these strange and stressful times. 

We are so pleased we could find a friendly professional vet with some common sense and were able to help our dog quickly. She is now recovering, minus the broken molar and the 3 roots.

 Booking Concert Tickets Hello all,

I'm considering buying concert tickets as a gift for my mum for Christmas, the concert is due to happen in May (I think it's the 12th but I'll have to check). We've all been very worn down by this year and our mental health has seriously suffered, so this will be a lovely thing to count down to (I was literally going to start a countdown).

I am 90% sure the concert will go ahead as planned, and with the current vaccine timetable of everyone being done by the end of March, I think there's a 50/50 chance that it might be a thing of the past by then. More realistically, I suspect we might still be wearing masks and there could be some social distancing.

I think the worst case scenario of tiers still being in place and everything getting cancelled is incredibly unlikely, but it does worry me. Anyone here want to give their thoughts??

How can this be fair when we’re putting our selves at risk going in everyday, the chances are if a key worker falls ill, they will still attend work as it’s near impossible to be living of SSP for a long amount of time.

 So if anyone at my workplace is sick, I have to sanitise afterwards So yeah, we've set up an isolation room, if anyone reports symptoms they're taking here to have their temp tested, if it comes back high, I'm to go in and sanitise the room afterwards.

I need advice, should I even be doing this job? I've been on sanitation about a month, had no real training for anything like this, I don't think we have the correct PPE. If anyone can offer advice on what to ask for and how to be safe doing this please let me know. I'm on an agency so I feel like I have no levarage to say no without losing my job. 

I also live with a family member who has COPD, asthma, diabetes and high blood pressure, so very high risk. The guilt if I passed this virus to her would be unbearable.

 How would you feel in this situation? Im on mobile and unsure how to create throwaway but will try to be vague but keep important info...

So i work in a very small private cosmetic dental practice and we are still open, business as usual. 

An associate  dentist was on holiday last week and is currently isolating (not confirmed but is struggling to get tested), he is coming back to work in a week but said he does not want to see patients aged 65+ or do any aerosol generating treatments. 

However, the owner (also a dentist), is still seeing patients and doing all treatments and has said we will carry on as normal... and he is aged 55+.

He said if staff want to, they can isolate (will require a sick note  for SSP) or they can go on unpaid leave if they dont feel comfortable working so that option is there.

He feels that the practice is needed and we need to be open for emergencies for patients.. 

im a low level staff but but im seeing all these companies being slated (and rightfully so) for putting their staff at risk  etc.. and i dont know if we fall into that category? its a bit of a grey area as we are clinical but cosmetic treatment is not really essential imo... i feel at the bare minimum we should stop aerosol generating treatment and leave that for dental hospitals? im  not sure if im just getting myself anxious for no reason with everything going on and just trust the owner?.. idk where to stand

I would really appreciate any other opinion really or anything 

Please don't think im trying to get out of working or anything, i genuinely do love my job and working with everyone, just feeling a bit conflicted seeing all this info  round

For example there is some views being expressed about  negative effects of Ibuprofen and not taking anti inflammatorys.

 Coronavirus, HIV and antiviral medicine - It makes sense... If the rumours are true.. I've seen so many posts in regards to Covid-19, from the conspiracies to the facts and all that's in between. 

What I find interesting are three different rumours

1 - The virus is man made and they've taken the "best" bits of the HIV virus and mixed it with something else to make a virus that spreads rapidly.

2 - All over the world doctors have successfully treated Covid19 with antiretroviral drugs, namely Tenofovir, which is a common drug used to suppress the HIV virus.

3 - People are testing positive and falling ill from Covid after being cured or isolated for 14 days. Anyone with HIV will know that they have to take their antiviral medicine every day for the rest of their life or the virus will resurface and turn in to AIDS. 

So, I don't know what I believe but I'm theorising that that virus was created using parts of other viruses, possibly hiv. If you've caught Covid, you can be treated with Tenofovir but it will only supersess the virus, not cure it. Once you stop the 
antiretroviral drugs Covid will return and possibly turn nasty (The same way HIV turns in to AIDS if untreated) 

I'm only theorising based on rumours and news reports - maybe I need some sleep!

 Dominic Cummings/School Theory I’ve been in primary education for many years. I’ve been unable to see any logic or sense in sending the youngest children back to school first. They are the most difficult to maintain distance from and often need close contact to feel safe or comforted. Many will need close contact to help with personal care. Policing playtimes will be very challenging. 

Now that it’s become clear Dominic Cummings has a four year old, it makes more sense. It wouldn’t surprise me at all if he wants his kid back at school and so has dictated national policy around his needs. 

The obvious rebuttal to this is that his kid may be privately educated (and therefore at home until Autumn) but I can’t find any info on this.

 Has anyone here recovered? Has anyone on here contracted Covid-19 and been officially tested / diagnosed with it, of any level of severity whatsoever - AND has subsequently recovered?

If so I’d love to ask you some questions, for example:

- Did you get a second test to confirm the virus has left, or any kind of official “all-clear” to ensure you aren’t returning to work or into the community whilst still infectious.

- Are you experiencing any ongoing symptoms or effects as a result of having had the virus, or from any treatment you may have been given?

- At what stage did they decide to test you? Can you identify what specifically it was that triggered the test?

- Have you any idea of the impact it had on people around you? For example, did it take you out of work for 2 weeks and place your family into financial hardship. Or did it cause your immediate family to also contract the virus?

- While infected did they place any official restrictions on your movements?

- Were you given any advice / guidance / instruction about sharing your experience online?

Thanks very much for your time.

 What is the outside airborne Apologies if this is ott I have a kid and just trying to be cautious. Just sat in my garden for a few minutes and over the fence so about a 25-30 distance in total (low fence) some guy is coughing his lungs out. I’ve got bad hearing so thought it was coming from somewhere else but turned around and saw the guy over the fence. I know it can survive 30 mins or so in the wind but does that depend on direction etc?

 Thoughts on today's numbers. This morning, we were told that we've moved to the "delay" phase.

We also know that the DoH announces the numbers at 2pm saying "as of 9am". So we know that they already know today's numbers.

Would this mean that we've possibly passed the 100 mark?

Predictions and opinions?

 Matt Hancock (health secretary btw) just said the virus spreads mainly when symptoms are present and not to worry about spread if there are no symptoms. I like Matt Hancock and believe he is concerned about this and doing what he can but what I can not believe is what he just said. He claims they are “guided by the science and evidence” when both those things show there are asymptomatic and pre symptomatic spread.

 Sick of everyone Here in the UK 90% of people are just saying "oh it's just flu" etc etc. All my colleagues and people at college are saying they're sick of everyone pretending it's more than just flu. But when you try to open their eyes to it you get outcast. Bullshit

 Getting a test How accurate is the test? 

I guess what I’m asking is if I get tested on a Wednesday after catching it on a Tuesday would it show up? Or does it take a few days for the virus to show?

 Injured hand what to do advice needed So I injured my hand a couple months back. I think my bone in my hand is moved or cracked, I think something is not right in there as it still hasn't healed over 2 months. Ive had my hand strapped up how I would assume they would do it in hospital but it still looks and feels uncomfortable. There isnt any serious pain at all just a slight pulling if I clench my fist my injured hand looks different to the other when fists clenched. I have really bad OCD and I'm starting to worry about it. Im not going to the hospital due to this virus, I couldn't think of anything worse right now it would send my anxiety through the roof and due to my OCD I feel the virus would be swarming through hospitals. I also don't want to use any NHS time right now as I would feel extremely selfish. Any advice? I keep telling myself I can heal my hand but when I check up on it it seems the same as before and then I freak out. It's got to the point im freaking out about it everyday thinking it will heal incorrectly.

 So what is actually going on? Every article I’ve read seems to suggest that the lockdown will end in May. My family seem to think well all be out by Friday and down the pub... 

There are people out and about not social distancing.. Roads are once again heaving. life is apparently getting back to normal?

It seems far too early to even consider easing the lockdown in May. I feel like we haven’t even hit the peak of how much damage this virus could do yet.
