 Opinions about BoJo's handling of the situation? I'm not a fan of his, but I am reasonably happy with how it is being handled.  He is being honest and open, and the measures seem balanced to me.  We want to slow the spread, but we also don't want to ruin everyone's lives in the process.  Thoughts?

 If Covid-19 had struck 30 years ago, would it have been handled differently? Would there have been as many deaths? Had COVID had hit in 1990 instead of 2020 would it have been handled any different? Would as many people have died? How would the economy have handled it without the capability for home working, online shopping, etc.

 Boris Johnson has a unique opportunity to make an open and honest statement, which will save more lives. It could be along the lines of....

"...and lastly, I nearly died from Covid-19 due to my poor diet. Yes, I am overweight. This was a wake-up call for me and I will eat less processed food. I urge you to do the same if your diet is poor. EAT REAL FOOD. PROTECT THE NHS. SAVE YOURSELF.”

 Eat out to help out - What are your predictions - Orderly behaviour or bedlam and people engaging in fist fights over chicken nuggets? It could go either way - How do you think this 'Eat out to Help out Thing' will pan out?

I am of the opinion that roads will be gridlocked from Monday, cues will form and people will be throthing at the mouth and fighting to get buckets of chicken for 50% of the usual retail price. It will not be pretty people, batten down the hatches and 'bug-out' whilst you still can.

Re-emerge on Thursday-Sunday when the scheme isn't operational, but still 'stay alert' as the occasional brainless fast food addict high on sugary snacks might still be throthing at the mouth and demanding 50% off their order.

 After WW1 and WW2, Germany had to pay reparations to cover the damage caused. Should China be held accountable for this emergency? The Treaty of Versailles (signed in 1919) and the 1921 London Schedule of **Payments** required **Germany** to **pay** 132 billion gold marks (US$33 billion) in **reparations** to cover civilian damage caused during the war. This figure was divided into three categories of bonds: A, B, and C

**World War II** In February of 1945, the Allies estimated that **Germany would owe** about $20 billion. By winter of 1945, total reparations were estimated at over $300 billion. 

This still left Germany with debts it had incurred in order to finance the reparations, and these were revised by the Agreement on German External Debts in 1953. After another pause pending the reunification of Germany, the last installment of these debt repayments was paid on **3 October 2010**

 Pedestrian social distancing rules I go for a walk everyday in London so I am an “avid” pedestrian myself but so many others seem completely oblivious to social distancing. Right now the guidelines are to keep 2 metres apart. Even when we change to 1 metre, we still need to keep as far apart as possible where possible. Pavement in London is usually about 2 metres wide (some narrower), so social distancing is generally doable. 

-If you are walking down the pavement, you need to stick to one side of the pavement at all times. 
-If someone comes toward you, then both passerby’s should get as far to either side of the pavement as possible (walk on the curb, or get as close to the fence or shrubs as possible). 
-If you are on the street side on a narrower path and can walk in the road then you need to do that.  
-If you are not comfortable with walking in the road then you need to stick to the inner side of the pavement. 
-If you are walking in a group of 2+ you need to be in single file, not hogging the entire width of the pavement. If you must hog the width, then walk quickly. 
-if you must stop while walking, pull off to the side and be strategic about where you are stopping. If you stop in the middle of pavement you are claiming ownership of that entire section of pavement (extremely selfish). 
- Cyclists need to be aware of how close they get to pedestrians. Realise this can be tricky though. 

Social distancing has made me realise how truly careless the majority of us are. People just walk down the middle of a pavement with zero remorse for pushing someone to the road when there is ample room on the pavement for two if they just moved over. I am pregnant so I’m obviously more on edge than some, but it’s SO frustrating. 

People were adhering to most of the “rules” I listed above back in April, but seem to have stopped since then.

 Covid-19, Stagflation and TEOTWAWKI Where is this whole situation is leading, and what comes after? What is going to be the role of this pandemic in the grand sweep of human  history?

It is going to be at least two years before the pandemic itself dies  down, whether than is due to the availability of a vaccine, or because  three quarters of the global population has been exposed to the virus.  But by then, our current economic system will be broken beyond repair.

I am now reasonably confident in predicting that we are heading for Stagflation on Steroids. So do these people:

[

What is stagflation?

[

&gt;Stagflation  is a combination of stagnant economic growth, high unemployment, and  high inflation. It's an unnatural situation because inflation is not  supposed to occur in a weak economy. In a normal market economy, slow  growth prevents inflation. As a result, consumer demand drops enough to  keep prices from rising. Stagflation can only occur if government  policies disrupt normal market functioning.

Current conditions are not just ripe for stagflation, but for the most  extreme form of stagflation imaginable. We have a combination an economy  that is not just weak, but has largely been shut down, and open-ended money-printing on a scale that dwarfs everything that happened in the  wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Government polices aren't just  "disrupting normal market functioning." The "normal market" has  vanished. Government policies are all that is left.

Stagflation was supposed to be consigned to the history books:

&gt;Why Stagflation (Probably) Won't Reoccur  
&gt;  
&gt;In 2011, people became concerned about stagflation again. They worried  that the Fed's expansive monetary policies, used to rescue the economy  from the 2008 financial crisis, would cause inflation.  
&gt;  
&gt;At the same time, Congress approved an expansive fiscal policy. It  included the economic stimulus package and record levels of deficit  spending. Meanwhile, the economy was only growing 1% to 2%. People  warned of the risk of stagflation if inflation worsened and the economy  didn't improve.  
&gt;  
&gt;This massive increase in global liquidity prevented deflation, a far  greater risk. The Fed won't allow inflation to go beyond its inflation  target of 2% for the core inflation rate. If inflation rose above that  target, the Fed would reverse course and institute constrictive monetary  policy.  
&gt;  
&gt;The unusual conditions that created stagflation in the 1970s are  unlikely to reoccur. First, the Fed no longer practices stop-go monetary  policies. Instead, it commits to a consistent direction. Second, the  removal of the dollar from the gold standard was a once-in-a-lifetime  event. Third, the wage-price controls that constrained supply wouldn't  even be considered today.

Firstly, saying the Fed is committed to a consistent direction has  become rather silly, because there's nowhere further for it to go. It  has already dropped interest rates to zero and committed to infinite  money-printing. The only other thing it can do is go back in the other  direction, unless we're talking negative interest rates (which brings  its own fatal problems).

Secondly, while it is true that the dollar can only be removed from the gold standard once, it is also true that gold now stands as the benchmark against which all fiat currencies - the entire monetary system  - is measured. And that means stagflation could still bring that system down, because the price of gold and silver will go to the moon.

Thirdly, it is very premature to talk about what wouldn't even be  considered today. The person who wrote those words last year did not  imagine the crisis the world finds itself in right now.

I think stagflation is now guaranteed, and I also think that this year, due to a massive drop in global dimming, we are going to see a big lurch in global warming. So we're going to be faced with the stark reality of both ecological and economic collapse, concurrently.

What happens after stagflation sets in?

My guess is *stagflation all the way down* and techno-industrial civilisation begins its first big leg down towards collapse. Stagflation becomes the new normal, because it will be impossible to fix. The only way to stop the inflation would be to hike interest rates to 20% and stop printing money, but that will lead to the sort of hardship that triggers revolutions. The monetary system won't actually collapse, but all forms of storing value which are tied to the fiat money system will start losing value with respect to those that don't. In other words, things like precious metals, property/land and fine art will be continually inflating in price (at maybe 10% or 20% a  year), while everything else, including cash and government debt, will be losing real value at a similar rate.

This presumably leads to revolutions, wars, starvation and/or die-off. The end of the world as we know it.

Is there a way to avoid an apocalyptic outcome?

Well, there's eco-socialism. If we want to try to save something  resembling civilisation as we understand it, then an  ecologically-sustainable form of socialism will be the only game in town.

Personally I doubt it will happen, because the general population is too stupid to understand why it is needed and unwilling to revolt to the extent needed to make it happen.

 Can people please realise the economy and our lives are interlinked? The economy is our lives. Nearly everything we do is linked to the economy in some way. There is a reason why people in countries with stronger economies have higher life expectancies. It isn't just about rich people getting richer.

If the economy tanks then most will suffer. There won't be enough to fund essential services and thousands could be pushed into poverty which shortens life expectancy in itself.

This isn't about economy vs lives, it's economy = lives. People shouldn't be called selfish murderers just because they're worried about the long-term effects this shutdown could have on everyone.

 Why People Aren’t Listening People are waiting for facts. Hard facts before they listen or they act. 
The problem is those facts will come in the shape of an overwhelmed system and people dead and dying.

In this environment with corona, you CANT only go by facts. It HAS to be feelings and presumptions too. 
It HAS to be. 
Facts are too slow so you have to use an element of common sense, gut feeling and caution.
