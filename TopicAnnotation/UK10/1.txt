 Priority Groups population breakdown? Is there a page that breaks down the UK population by the 11 JCVI vaccine priority groups?

If they think they will have four million doses by the end of the year, how deep into the groups does that get? Group 2? 3?

 Where can I get a decent mask? I’ve been looking over Amazon and I can’t make sense from all the scams. Some look like regular dust masks, others don’t even have actual filters.

 Schools open during proposed next lockdown As a teacher I wonder what others think about this.  

Here are my concerns

1) schools are not Covid secure,  30 plus kids in a classroom without masks just can’t be ok.  They are frequently touching each other.  There is no social distancing.  I feel very unsafe as a teacher,  we have no protection.

Solution.  15 To a class max,  maybe 1 week on, one week off to facilitate this

2) staffing is low,  so we are buying in cover the whole time,  and everyone knows a cover teacher is not a specialist. 

3) we are having to teach classes with up to a third
Of the Kids missing,  so Schools are not teaching everyone.  The idea that online work can be set alongside what is already taught in the classroom is not possible with the low staffing levels.  Possible solution is to have some online only classes where the resources and time
Can be put into setting them up and running them.

4) exams are still muted To go
Ahead so there is extra pressure on teachers for more face to face interaction with student on weekends and evening,  cancel the exams
To reduce this burden and interaction.

5) some qualifications, btec haven’t even released what the plan for this year is yet.

6) schools are currently wasting their time on open evenings, performance management,  inset when all we should be doing is trying to get students the best experience we should.

 This is what is worrying about schools opening (repost from main coronavirus sub). I’ve already seen this happening last few weeks with parents sending sick kids to nursery etc. Or getting a test and it’s negative so sending sick kid with symptoms right back to childcare setting.

 Independent private school charging full term fee? We just received a letter from my daughter’s school asking us to pay the full term fees as normal. They are not even giving any help online! They stressed on the letter that a fee reduction or delay would be “impossible” at the time. We really thought this was a joke! How very unsympathetic of the school. What are your thoughts?

 Should my friend be self isolating? So ‘friend A’ is the person in question, and essentially was insistent that he was able to come to the pub with a group of us.

Friend A hugged a person and spent 5 minutes in contact with someone who had coronavirus. ‘Friend B’ was also living with the person who had coronavirus.  Friend A and Friend B then took a 4 hour car journey together. Friend B is now self isolating for two weeks as suggested. He had a test which came back negative but is continuing to self isolate. 

Friend A also had a test (from his doctor parent) which came back negative. He is insistent he absolutely cannot have the virus and does not need to self isolate. 

Long story short, we decided we would not feel comfortable with him being at the pub, particularly as social distancing is not always fully possible (which is already a risk).

Is our response fair, or is he correct in not being at any greater risk than any of the rest of us. I hope this is relatively clear.     

Thank you.
