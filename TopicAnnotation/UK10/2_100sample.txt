 As of next week I would have been eligible for a higher minimum wage due to by birthday, however I have been furloughed. Am I still eligible for it? I hit the next age bracket up next week and it means that I am eligible for about 50% more than what I am being paid currently. Can I claim that? Or is my furlough pay set at what I was being paid at the point of being laid off?

 Furlough and new car. I'm been furloughed since the 24th March and at present have no info as to when I will return to work.

In Feb. My car was written off by a third party as I was sat at the back of stationary traffic on a motorway he failed to stop and ploughed into the back of me.

I was given a hire car while I waited for his insurance company to pay me out which the did last month but I kept the car as it was my only mode of transport and was unable to purchase another until the lockdown was lifted.

A week before the lockdown started I went and put a deposit a 2nd hand 2016 reg car from a local dealers but was unable to collect it because of the lockdown.

The local dealer are now open and are wanting me to collect the car this week but they have said i need to re sign the finance agreement as they was all cancelled when we went into lockdown.

With the uncertainty atm around work I'm reluctant to commit to the new car but the hire car company also want me to return the hire car.

Am I within my rights to keep the hire car ? 

I know I dont have to commit and re sign the finance agreement but then would I lose my deposit and they would no longer gold the car for me or if they have the deposit would they be obliged to keep it until I'm ready?

 Could isolation/quarantine put employers in breach of employees employment contracts ? Suppose I have a role which I cannot perform from home. I get a call from track and trace telling me to isolate. I have no symptoms, I feel fine. I call work and inform them I have been instructed to isolate/quarantine so what would they like me to do ? I tell them I am totally happy to come in to work if they want, or stay at home if they prefer. They order me to stay at home, and suddenly I have no pay, just SSP, or whatever the covid arrangements are. In this (very plausible) scenario, why are my my employers not in breach of my employment contract ? I did not feel sick, I was happy to come in to work and honor my contract, but I was instructed not to. What then would be the legal basis for my employment contract to be overridden ?

 Not been paid for work carried out in February and March due to covid-19 fears from my employer and he’s being shady about pay Not been paid for work carried out in February and March due to a covid -19 fears and my employer is being shady about pay

Employer refused to pay me in March for work I did in February and March due to Covid-19 they said they would pay me in the end of April once they knew what was happening.

just had a call with them today and they said they would not be paying me my full pay as they don’t want me to take the money and find a new job as they have had a girl do this before and it hurt them financially. 

They spoke with a solicitor and belive that if they owe me money I would be stuck and  have to stay and work for them in order to get the rest of my pay.it’s been nearly three months without a pay check and I’ve waited till today to be told that they are not giving me full pay, they won’t tell me how much pay they are going to give me either so it’s a mystery if I’ll get 75% of my pay or 25% 

Incase it matters it is a new job and I’m technically working as self employed under them and since it’s a new self employment job I can’t apply for the self employed benefit scheme for covid-19 as I have no self employed paycheck to send off to receive the benefits. 

Is this legal and what can I do, I’m really desperate for pay and I’ve been spending the little money I do have  under the believe that I would be getting a normal paycheck when I get paid.  I don’t get much money anyway and it all goes towards bills with little left at the end of the month.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

 Coronavirus, loneliness and younger people Current circumstances have brought into sharp focus the issue of loneliness in younger people - a study by the Mental Health Foundation found that whilst one in four adults in the UK have felt lonely because of Covid-19, young people aged 18 to 24 identified with this the most, with 44% saying they had experienced loneliness in current circumstances. If you fall within that age bracket and might like to talk to me for a feature piece I am doing,  please reply to my inbox? Any help greatly appreciated.

 Regarding the job retention scheme (80% wages paid) Hey.

I’m seeing a lot of people not properly understanding this and spreading misinformation. So I’ll highlight the key points that seem to be being overlooked.

You’re not just automatically entitled to 80% of your wages. 

You don’t apply for it, your employer does - at their discretion.

Your employer will only get the grant if they furlough you instead of laying you off or making you redundant. Furlough essentially means putting you on standby and promising to rehire you when the business opens again. 

To be able to rehire you again in the future, the company must be able to survive long enough to do so. There are cheap loans and rate cuts to help them achieve this. If the company owner doesn’t want to take on debt, and doesn’t have the cash to survive during months of not trading, it may be in their best interest to liquidate the company instead, and that’s their choice. No company = no grant.

If you’ve lost your job in the past weeks, the back pay is irrelevant if the company has already been liquidated. No company = no grant.

Unless the business is confident that it will reopen and be instantly bustling with trade again, then they might not be able to rehire everyone so will have to pick who to furlough and who to lay off. Only furloughed employees will receive their wage. But this shouldn’t be an issue with zero hour contracts, since when they reopen they won’t have to give everyone hours if they don’t have enough trade, so they can just furlough all of them.


So basically your employer needs to be able to remain closed with no cash flow for at least 3 months, maybe more, and also be confident that business will pick up when they do reopen to generate enough income to be successful and pay you all again.  

If you’re employer doesn’t want to try weather the storm and take the grant, then you are laid off/redundant and should be applying for universal credit while looking for another employment.

It’s still a great package and will help so many, but it won’t just pay EVERYONE who has lost their job, and it’s completely out if you’re hands as to wether you will get it or not.

I’m not trying to piss on anyone’s bonfire, I just don’t want people thinking they are financially safe only to find they actually aren’t and could have been putting their time to use looking for another job.

 Self Isolating And Sick Pay At my work, if I go off work sick then when I return I must write out holiday forms for the period I have been off sick and is taken out of my holidays as we don’t have sick pay at my work. 
If I am told to self isolate or we go into quarantine, I don’t have many holidays left and when I run out of holidays and I am sick I have to write a holiday form out and tick the box that says I am taking the holiday unpaid and won’t get paid for it.
What should I do? Is there special circumstances where I will still get paid in the even of long term lock down isolation.

 How long do you think the furlough grants will last? Hey guys,

I know Sunak has stated that the availability of the furlough grants has been extended to the end of June. What do you think will happen come the end of the June when they're still needed by employers? Sunak did comment they can be extended if necessary, I guess we will just have to wait and see if that's the case?

 Isolation Parameters Anyone else frustrated by isolation guidance from UK Gov and NHS being limited to 3 symtoms only (fever, persistent new cough, loss of taste/smell).

Just tested positive and didn't have any of these 3 symptoms initially, so I may have put others at risk but not isolating early enough. If other common symptoms such as chills / aches / sore throat / headache / fatigue were included like in other countries then maybe less cases would get through the net. 
So many people I know have had covid without the typical 3 hallmark symptoms, at least in early infection.

 Can you be in a social bubble in England AND an extended household in Wales? I was looking at the rules for forming social bubbles in England and extended households in Wales. In England, two households can join a bubble if at least one of those households has only one single adult. In Wales, two households of any size can join an extended household. You can form these groups cross-border, but it's not entirely clear from the wording of the guidance if you can be in both a social bubble in England and a different extended household in Wales.

The scenario I'm thinking of is family A in England forming a bubble with single adult B in England. So now A and B are treated in England as a single household. Can family A now form an extended household with family C in Wales (assuming single adult B would not be part of this unit). So family A are staying with single adult B while in England and with family C while in Wales, but B and C are not directly interacting).

My gut feel is that this would not be allowed because the extended household in Wales should not form with family A because they are already 2 households due to being in a bubble with B, but I can find anything specific about this in the guidance.

I know family C from Wales can visit family A in England in any case (with distancing), but my feeling is A cannot visit C in Wales.

Thoughts? Am I interpreting the rules correctly?

EDIT: Thanks for comments so far, that's very helpful. I should clarify one statement I made above - the A+B bubble is not a permanent living arrangement, it is two separate houses with A occasionally staying with B while in England, but otherwise living separately.

 UK Government announced that employees under furlough continue to earn holiday entitlement, will this be paid by companies themselves, and incentivize them to issue redundancies? As noted on [this]( page (taken 22nd April 2020):

&gt; Holiday Pay

&gt; Furloughed employees continue to accrue leave as per their employment contract.
The employer and employee can agree to vary holiday entitlement as part of the furlough agreement, however almost all workers are entitled to 5.6 weeks of statutory paid annual leave each year which they cannot go below.

&gt; Employees can take holiday whilst on furlough. Working Time Regulations require holiday pay to be paid at the employee’s normal rate of pay or, where the rate of pay varies, calculated on the basis of the average pay received by the employee in the previous 52 working weeks. Therefore, if a furloughed employee takes holiday, the employer should pay their usual holiday pay in accordance with the Working Time Regulations.

&gt; Employers will be obliged to pay additional amounts over the grant, though will have the flexibility to restrict when leave can be taken if there is a business need. This applies for both the furlough period and the recovery period.

&gt; If an employee usually works bank holidays then the employer can agree that this is included in the grant payment. If the employee usually takes the bank holiday as leave then the employer would either have to top up their usual holiday pay, or give the employee a day of holiday in lieu.

&gt; During this unprecedented time, we are keeping the policy on holiday pay during furlough under review.


How does this work for industries that will be massively affected by the loss of trade? How can pubs, cinemas and other social venues possibly keep staff on payroll even if the government are paying, and still allow employees to earn holiday which will cause even more havoc considering it's full pay, and you might need to have staff cover that shift.

I fear this guidance will only lead to mass lay off's for the worst affected once the numbers are crunched and IF businesses have to pay out of pocket would rather cut their losses.

Depending on how this works (I.E who pays for the holiday and how that works out), I fully expect to lose my job simply as a result that they can't afford to have staff earning holiday and not be making any income.
