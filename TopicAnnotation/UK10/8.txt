 Wash your hands and pubs and clubs should have soap ? 

Is it just me or does anyone else feel like a rat in a lab right now ? On one hand they shut multiple surgeries. On the other hand the best they can do is hold up bits of paper saying wash your hands ?  I can assure you everyone is washing there hands. Mine are squeaky and covered in alcohol gel all day.

 Supermarket concerns, same for anyone else? Just come back from the local ASDA and I notice staff have begun tearing down and pulling up the one way signs and arrows from the end shelves and floors. Thankfully the vast majority are wearing their masks, but social distancing no longer exists within the store.

Cases are rapidly increasing as Boris Johnson warns the public about a potential second wave on the horizon, so I'm really hoping shops and supermarkets aren't relaxing the rules at this crucial point in this pandemic.

 Public Accounts Committee report calls Government's response to Social Care during the Covid 19 pandemic "Slow, inconsistent and negligent” In its report " [Readying the NHS and social care for the COVID-19](  , the Committee of Public Accounts highlighted The Government’s “slow, inconsistent, and at times negligent approach” to social care in the Covid-19 pandemic (which) has exposed the “tragic impact” of  “years of inattention, funding cuts and delayed reforms”, leaving the sector as a “poor relation” that has suffered badly in the pandemic.

 The Committee is demanding from Government a “3-point plan” by September, ahead of the second wave, covering health, the economy &amp; procurement of medical supplies and equipment. 

 Meg Hillier MP, Chair of the Committee, said:

&gt;**“**The failure to provide adequate PPE or testing to the millions of staff and volunteers who risked their lives to help us through the first peak of the crisis is a sad, low moment in our national response. Our care homes were effectively thrown to the wolves, and the virus has ravaged some of them.**"**
