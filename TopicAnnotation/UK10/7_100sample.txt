 Very brief ZOE update 

Hello again,

ZOE app has updated their figure for daily new infections, seems this happens on Thursday‚Äôs, so I will probably update this now on Monday and Thursdays from here on, which will tie in nicely with the ONS update on Fridays so we can compare the two studies.

The estimation of new infections has dropped down from 1626 to 1434 new infections per day.

North West (23-98 new cases per 1 million population) and London (17-67) have the highest rate of daily new cases.

South West (1-27) and East of England (3-36) the lowest.
++++++++++
 Is the 10,000 tests being implemented now? Will the new figures at 2pm show this? 
++++++++++
 New ONS and ZOE infection data: ONS estimate up, ZOE estimate down Both the ONS and ZOE/Kings College have updated their estimates around infections today.

ONS have [revised their 'estimated number of people infected' figure]( upwards from one in 1,700 two weeks ago, to **one in 1,100** in today's release.

However, ZOE/Kings College have [gone the other way]( revising their 'estimated daily infections' figure to **2,341**, down from around 3,900 in the last major update.

As far as I know, this is the first time the direction of travel has been different between these two studies.

Unsure what to take from this but there you go.

\*\*FAQs

Do I Need to Self Isolate?

&gt;If  you have a fever and/or a cough, you and your household need to isolate  for 14 days starting from the time the last person began to show  symptoms. If after 7 days you are still showing symptoms and/or get  worse within that time, dial 111 for further help and advice. Do not go  to your GP or hospital. Dial 999 if you or someone in your household is  seriously ill and/or struggling to breathe.

Do I Have The Coronavirus?

&gt;We  are not doctors and cannot tell you over the internet whether or not  you have the virus. Self isolate, get help if necessary. Refer to the  links above for symptoms but continue to self isolate even if you think  you have a common cold.

Should I be Taking Ibuprofen?

&gt;Current advice from the NHS suggests that [you should avoid ibuprofen for the time being](

Am I in the At Risk Group?

\&gt;Those in the at risk group will soon be contacted by their GP to let them know and to advise them how to proceed. In the meantime, [this link]( provides information of who the governement consider to be at risk.

What is the difference between social distancing and self isolation?

 Infection fatality rate is now at around 5.22%. Infection rate is underestimated by 4 fold. We have no ideia where we are, where're heading, the speed we're going. Won't even comment on the fact there're no official figures for fatalities and recoveries aren't updated since sunday....

 Interested to know peoples opinions on giving your details if you go to pub So on the radio this morning, I was hearing that from this announcement due tomorrow. It is expected that pubs will be opening up again from 4th July.
It was also added that if you enter the pub, you will be expected to give your contact details, in case at a later date, the contact tracers need to contact you.

Assuming this is the case, because we don‚Äôt yet have a track and trace app in place. 

But why would this be the case for just pubs? Why not any other places which will be looking to open up?

I understand some may not have at issue. And I could well be jumping the gun on what is at the moment a rumour.
From my personal opinion, I‚Äôm always hesitant at handing over my details in case it gets into the wrong hands.
++++++++++
 Fatality rate Why is the fatality rate being given as 3.4%
This figure includes all active cases.
The true number should be from closed cases which is 59407 worldwide. 55995 recovered and 3412 deaths. Thats a 6% fatality rate.

++++++++++
 Government strategy to not test most people is leading to vast undereporting of actual figures. We need to track the cases ourselves  
++++++++++
 Unpopular opinion. Infection rates, death rates, and positive testing data is hugely misleading and it makes no sense to make projections and compare ourselves to other counties with them. We have have always been at the point where all data coming out over this is a direct function of whichever country's testing capacity, and their criteria for what counts as a recordable death.

While some countries are only testing the sick, others are testing all that have come into contact. While some counties are reporting all deaths of patients who had covid 19, others are only reporting if you specifically died of it.

It seems like a few countries are peaking right now, or have they just hit their capacity to test?

We've got to a point where numbers aren't comparable anymore and a daily "update and comparison" is worthless.

The graphs and projections are all very nice but don't statistically add anything to the conversation except for spread misinformation.

 ONS COVID-19 Infection Survey data shows a rise in cases 0.24% to 0.27% **tldr**; estimate of current infections rised from 136k to 148k with higher confidence (10k samples)

ONS Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey data shows a rise in cases.

* It is estimated that 0.27% of the population in England tested positive for COVID-19 (95% confidence interval: 0.17% to 0.41%).
* It is estimated 148,000 people in England were currently infected with COVID-19 (95% confidence interval: 94,000 to 222,000).

In previous report (published 10th May) it was:

* It is estimated that 0.24% of the population in England tested positive for COVID-19 (95% confidence interval: 0.14% to 0.40%).
* It is estimated 136,000 people in England were currently infected with COVID-19 (95% confidence interval: 76,000 to 225,000).

data source: [

 Coronavirus: Almost 30,000 'excess' care homes deaths (BBC report on ONS data) I don't think this has been posted yet: a [BBC news]( story on an [ONS report]( about care home deaths.

Key points:

* Almost 30,000 more care home residents in England and Wales died during the coronavirus outbreak than during the same period in 2019
* While 20,000 mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate, another 10,000 of the excess deaths were registered to other, non-Covid, causes. Previous analysis from the ONS has suggested that many of those "non-Covid" deaths could have involved undiagnosed coronavirus
* Three-quarters of these deaths occurred within the care homes themselves and a quarter were care home residents who died in hospitals

Not mentioned in the story, but a simple calculation to do, is that this means something like **40% of all UK Coronavirus deaths have been care home residents**.

The BBC story also links to another [ONS report]( on Coronavirus in care homes (the "Vivaldi" study). An interesting thing that comes out of that is that care home residents were at higher risk where the home employed a lot of agency staff, and where staff did not receive sick pay. (I am not sure how staff could not receive sick pay; perhaps this refers to people on zero-hours contracts. I couldn't see any more explanation in the report.)

 Question about the timeline While the virus has been around in China for a while now it only started to have a widespread breakout towards the end of January, when it went from having 1,300 confirmed cases to 77,600 cases 30 days later.

However since then the number of new cases has dropped dramatically and there has been a decrease in the number of new cases every day since the 21st of February.

My question is why are we expecting the timeline to be different in the UK and rest of the world? 

We're being told that the peak of the UK outbreak is likely 10-14 weeks away, despite us being in a similar position to where China was at the end of January.

 For those who have been tested so far - was there any issue with your test and results? I have just done the test today - it went well as expected but the swab itself got contaminated with food residue which was left on my tonsils (was advised that we can eat as usual). 

So I am just wondering if this can impact test results in any shape or form? Has anyone had any issues with the results and was asked to repeat the test etc?

 COVID19 positive and negative test results?? Hello!  My partner and I both tested negative for COVID19 (he is a key-worker in the military) and it gave advice to us to stay away from those who are positive and we no longer have to self-isolate for 14 days, etc.

We are both curious as to what the message has been to those testing positive for the COVID19 tests?  We would be curious to see what the text-message or email looks like, if anyone has one handy.  My partner is in and out of his workplace all the time so we are both curious as to what the advice looks like to those who tested positive.

Thanks xx

 Need a sample of an NHS test result email Hi,

Hungary has just introduced two-week quarantine for travellers from the UK. I'm a filmmaker and only came to the UK for a 2-day shoot, and have to go back to Hungary tonight for more shoots. There's no need to go to quarantine if you can show a printed negative NHS test result, but I simply don't have time to visit a test site and wait for the results. I am asking for your help! If you would be so kind as to send me your test result email in a PDF or whatever format (even a screenshot would do) I would be extremely grateful. You can edit your personal details out if you want to. I will add my details in, and it will be accepted at the airport. 

TL;DR: 

Travelling back to Hungary. Can't afford to stay in quarantine there. Don't have time to visit NHS test site. Need sample of negative NHS test result email so I can edit it.

 PSA: Local Support, create FB Groups for your PostCode Prefix All other forms of geographical boundary are too large, eldery and infirm are already turning to facebook for help and support, but being lost or drowned in noise. Additionally people willing to help are navigating large distances needlessly.

The only way to effectively manage this is to create numerous hyperlocal groups

*  M23 Coronavirus Community
*  KY5 Coronavirus Community
*  S2 Coronavirus Community
* TD3 Coronavirus Community

If you can, please consider creating one for your local community, and point people to it from regional groups.

If these become too noisy, they can be further split. Our UK PostCode system is perfect to organize community efforts and responses.

The time to implement this is now, please do not underestimate the speed of magnitude of this tsunami.

Thanks.

 To save a thousand more posts.... No, regardless of X, you can't be tested - not until your condition worsens to the point of hospitalization. The details of X don't matter, the answer is no. If you aren't hospitalized, you cannot and will not be tested. It's not our decision and yes, it sucks, but it's a matter of fact.

Yes, after situation Y or symptom Z, you should probably self-isolate. The details of Y and Z don't matter, the advice is still the same. You should self-isolate if you can, for the safety of both yourself and for your community as a whole.

 The data used for basis of tiering decisions From [Tiering decisions to be made through national command structure](

-----
Decisions on tiers are made by ministers based on public health recommendations informed by the following factors:

* case detection rate (in all age groups and, in particular, among the over 60s)
* how quickly case rates are rising or falling
* positivity in the general population
* pressure on the NHS ‚Äì including current and projected (3 to 4  weeks out) NHS capacity ‚Äì including admissions, general/acute/ICU bed  occupancy, staff absences
* local context and exceptional circumstances such as a local but contained outbreak

If these indicators are not improving, an area may be moved up a tier  and if the trajectory improves, the area may move to a lower tier.
-----

and down at the bottom:

-----
A '[watchlist]( will be published every Thursday detailing the latest data at a regional level, providing the rationale and data behind these decisions.

Looking at the data in that 'watchlist' link, it appears it contains much of the case data used to make the decisions about tiering. I don't know if the NHS data is published anywhere though.
