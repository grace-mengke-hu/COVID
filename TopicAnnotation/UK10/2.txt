 Coronavirus, loneliness and younger people Current circumstances have brought into sharp focus the issue of loneliness in younger people - a study by the Mental Health Foundation found that whilst one in four adults in the UK have felt lonely because of Covid-19, young people aged 18 to 24 identified with this the most, with 44% saying they had experienced loneliness in current circumstances. If you fall within that age bracket and might like to talk to me for a feature piece I am doing,  please reply to my inbox? Any help greatly appreciated.

 Regarding the job retention scheme (80% wages paid) Hey.

I’m seeing a lot of people not properly understanding this and spreading misinformation. So I’ll highlight the key points that seem to be being overlooked.

You’re not just automatically entitled to 80% of your wages. 

You don’t apply for it, your employer does - at their discretion.

Your employer will only get the grant if they furlough you instead of laying you off or making you redundant. Furlough essentially means putting you on standby and promising to rehire you when the business opens again. 

To be able to rehire you again in the future, the company must be able to survive long enough to do so. There are cheap loans and rate cuts to help them achieve this. If the company owner doesn’t want to take on debt, and doesn’t have the cash to survive during months of not trading, it may be in their best interest to liquidate the company instead, and that’s their choice. No company = no grant.

If you’ve lost your job in the past weeks, the back pay is irrelevant if the company has already been liquidated. No company = no grant.

Unless the business is confident that it will reopen and be instantly bustling with trade again, then they might not be able to rehire everyone so will have to pick who to furlough and who to lay off. Only furloughed employees will receive their wage. But this shouldn’t be an issue with zero hour contracts, since when they reopen they won’t have to give everyone hours if they don’t have enough trade, so they can just furlough all of them.


So basically your employer needs to be able to remain closed with no cash flow for at least 3 months, maybe more, and also be confident that business will pick up when they do reopen to generate enough income to be successful and pay you all again.  

If you’re employer doesn’t want to try weather the storm and take the grant, then you are laid off/redundant and should be applying for universal credit while looking for another employment.

It’s still a great package and will help so many, but it won’t just pay EVERYONE who has lost their job, and it’s completely out if you’re hands as to wether you will get it or not.

I’m not trying to piss on anyone’s bonfire, I just don’t want people thinking they are financially safe only to find they actually aren’t and could have been putting their time to use looking for another job.

 Complete loss of taste and smell I lost my sense of taste and smell about a week and a half ago. No cough or high temp but shivers, achy, sore throat, and then suddenly I realised I had no taste and smell. Fully recovered from everything but still do not have any taste and smell. 

Interested to see if many other people have - and I'm talking a complete and utter loss of taste and smell

 Furlough and new car. I'm been furloughed since the 24th March and at present have no info as to when I will return to work.

In Feb. My car was written off by a third party as I was sat at the back of stationary traffic on a motorway he failed to stop and ploughed into the back of me.

I was given a hire car while I waited for his insurance company to pay me out which the did last month but I kept the car as it was my only mode of transport and was unable to purchase another until the lockdown was lifted.

A week before the lockdown started I went and put a deposit a 2nd hand 2016 reg car from a local dealers but was unable to collect it because of the lockdown.

The local dealer are now open and are wanting me to collect the car this week but they have said i need to re sign the finance agreement as they was all cancelled when we went into lockdown.

With the uncertainty atm around work I'm reluctant to commit to the new car but the hire car company also want me to return the hire car.

Am I within my rights to keep the hire car ? 

I know I dont have to commit and re sign the finance agreement but then would I lose my deposit and they would no longer gold the car for me or if they have the deposit would they be obliged to keep it until I'm ready?

 Can you be in a social bubble in England AND an extended household in Wales? I was looking at the rules for forming social bubbles in England and extended households in Wales. In England, two households can join a bubble if at least one of those households has only one single adult. In Wales, two households of any size can join an extended household. You can form these groups cross-border, but it's not entirely clear from the wording of the guidance if you can be in both a social bubble in England and a different extended household in Wales.

The scenario I'm thinking of is family A in England forming a bubble with single adult B in England. So now A and B are treated in England as a single household. Can family A now form an extended household with family C in Wales (assuming single adult B would not be part of this unit). So family A are staying with single adult B while in England and with family C while in Wales, but B and C are not directly interacting).

My gut feel is that this would not be allowed because the extended household in Wales should not form with family A because they are already 2 households due to being in a bubble with B, but I can find anything specific about this in the guidance.

I know family C from Wales can visit family A in England in any case (with distancing), but my feeling is A cannot visit C in Wales.

Thoughts? Am I interpreting the rules correctly?

EDIT: Thanks for comments so far, that's very helpful. I should clarify one statement I made above - the A+B bubble is not a permanent living arrangement, it is two separate houses with A occasionally staying with B while in England, but otherwise living separately.
