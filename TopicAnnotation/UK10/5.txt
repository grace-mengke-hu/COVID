 Why aren't all non-essential services being closed with immediate effect? Obviously, there are vital services that are required to keep the country running. These include, but are not limited to:

Hospitals

Emergency services 

Supermarkets 

Petrol stations 

Delivery drivers

Haulage transport

Waste and bin collections

Although Boris has talked of the need to avoid public gatherings, there is no European-style lockdown at this point and no official policy on non-essential services shutting down, when there really should be

The kind of non-essential services that I am talking about include, but are not limited to:

Gyms and sports facilities 

Pubs and restaurants 

All entertainment venues of any kind

Schools and universities 

None of these have been officially forced to close despite government recommendations to avoid gatherings and to work from home where possible. So why has there been no official line on this?

Boris and the Chancellor today announced that there would be an economic rescue package for those affected, but seem slow on taking drastic measures to actually stop the spread of the virus in its tracks

I really don't understand why they're delaying this at this point - can anyone here shed any light?

 Bad employer ‪I work for a Company that sells car parts. I completely understand delivering parts for key workers to keep their cars on the road. I don’t understand having to deliver unnecessary items such as floor paint, car cleaning equipment, an oil filter For an unnecessary‬ Oil change. Yet my company is allowed to stay open to deliver these items, putting me and my Family at risk. I have to go to work otherwise I won’t get paid a penny. We are busier now than before the lock down because think it’s a prefect time to get their car serviced while they’re off work

 Driving for recreation? As a family with 2 people on the extremely vulnerable list we are not going to be going out in public any time soon, but we have considered going out in the car just for a drive. It would be a nice change of scenery and not require us to come in contact with anyone, especially as we would only drive on country roads as we live in the countryside. I personally think the risk is very low and would be a lift for morale(all be it a small one). But cant decide if this would be against the new rules. Does anyone have any incite as to the legality of it and do people think its a good idea

 What are these 'certain underlying conditions'? BBC is reporting that people over 70 and younger people with 'certain underlying conditions' will be asked to self isolate soon. What are the 'certain underlying conditions'? I assume it's things like lung disease but I would like to see the official guidance.
