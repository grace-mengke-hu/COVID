 Pensioner shopping time How did it go in your area?
At 7am here they were queued for over a mile down the road, by 8am general public admission the shop's 80% empty, no bread, pasta, wipes, toilet rolls, baby milk (pensioners are buying as powdered milk replacements), drinks etc.

I tried to get some things for my gran but as I'm not a vulnerable person i wasn't allowed in as she wasn't with me (87, blind &amp; household)

Do we think they'll continue with the 7-8am timeslot going forward?

 So here‚Äôs some things that have been openly said by government. Food suppliers and NHS. Some facts you may need to know. We are a country of 65m people. In the war we were 25 million. And we were on rations in the war. Countries are all going to be stocking up themselves. So they may not have enough to send to us. Or certainly a limited amount

These are on the cards at the moment. Maybe it won‚Äôt get this bad but this has all been suggested 

Basic food will be focused on to supply. So instead of stuffed peppers with cream cheese, artisan bread with pine nuts and Gorgonzola. It will be flour, eggs, milk powder more likely than milk. Pasta. Rice. Beans. Potatoes. Dried goods and probably soups.  This is part of the emergency plan 

The Army will be called in to a town near you. Yes the army will be guarding Tesco and Lidl. And will shoot dead anyone trying to raid the stores 

Food will be rationed. This could go in four months or a tear. Or it could break down the fabric of society. Literally 

Forced quarantine. Laws are already in place 

Roadblocks and travel restrictions. These are very likely. 

The police will not attend crimes. You get robbed. You sort it out. They will be tied
Up with the virus and food. 

Bodies may have to be cremated or buried in mass graves.  Sorry no service. 

I was in Asda. Saw a women looking for what was left on the pasta aisle. I threw her a smile. She just looked scared. And said. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe this is happening‚Äù expect to feel this and probably say it as well. 

An epidemiologist said that right now was like playing on the beach when we know full well a tsunami is coming.  Yes it may be fine now but we know damn well what‚Äôs about to happen. It‚Äôs probably soon time to run away from it

 How to report pubs not complying with closures and social distancing measures? I went for a walk last night and saw a local pub open filled with people, playing pool and drinking together, absolutely no regard to the fact that we‚Äôre trying to stop the spread.

 What do face visors worn alone do to prevent the spread of Covid-19? I saw the labour leader Sir Kier Starmer yesterday doing a walkaround in some sort of factory wearing just a face visor. Now I'm totally on board with face coverings/masks that closely cover the nose and mouth. I have looked into the research and I am covinced they work and the more people who wear them the better in my view. 

I can also see how a face visor worn in conjuction with a face covering or mask can perhaps add an extra level of supplementary protection to the wearer and those around them. However, along with the labour leader I've seen staff in hairdressers and pubs also wear face visors but no mask. 

Only today I walked past a hairdressers and the customer was sat in the chair having hjer hair done whilst wearing a homemade cotton face covering. Yet the hairdresser who was doing her hair was wearing a face visor but no face covering/mask at all. I'm at a loss as to why so many people are having such a difficult time understanding how to reduce the risk of transmitting this virus.

Or is it me who's wrong? Is a face visor worn alone without a mask likely to make any tangible difference to the spread of Covid-19?

 Prepping. Why you should never publicise it. Some of the news reports now about hoarding etc. are exactly why you should never tell anyone if you stay prepping, or maintain any kind of supply of food etc. at home, in case of things such as this. 

Many of us in here have been telling everyone since early January that this could be a problem. Ample time to add a few bits to each food shop to build a buffer. Don‚Äôt wait for the authorities. Sort you and yours out now. 

Did many of your friends/family/colleagues take note? Unlikely. They are the ones now rushing out to buy everything in bulk along with everyone else, and then complaining when it runs out (for a few days only, probably).

The reason you need a home stash is entirely so you DON‚ÄôT have to get into a supermarket scrum with potentially infected people!

I mean this has been going on for MONTHS now. And some people think NOW is the time to get some hand gel? What kind of life-planning is that?

You put them on when you leave your door, or when you‚Äôre about to get on public transport (PT), and you take them off upon leaving PT and disposing at the nearest bin on the way to your office, or at a bin at your office. Take them off by peeling them at the edge. 

If you have some, then you could rub a bit of hand gel on after removing the gloves too.

 How To Make A Homemade COVID-19 Mask In 2 Minutes #Masks4All 
++++++++++
 The NHS needs face masks. The UK needs mask factories. If Italy and Hong Kong can set them up, why can't we? I keep reading stories about a lack of protective equipment for our frontline NHS staff - e.g. [this Guardian article]( I haven't been able to find any evidence that enough masks (surgical *or* respirator) are being made here in the UK. If that's true, this is a timebomb - we've got to protect our nurses and doctors for as long as this lasts, and we *can't expect to keep buying them from abroad* when every country is dealing with its own outbreak.

[In Italy, a textile manufacturer has switched to making masks](

[People in Hong Kong set up a factory to mass-produce surgical masks]( For more details [here's a video about it]( The man who set up the factory wanted to sell masks for 13 cents each so everyone could afford them - not only healthcare workers.

Surely some of the world‚Äôs richer people, even millionaires, would be able to replicate this in their own countries. In the UK it could literally keep the NHS running, by reducing the numbers of staff who contract the virus themselves.

[Here's one of the studies on the usefulness of surgical masks]( and [here's another]( which concludes that surgical masks can be "highly" effective if used correctly. By the way, this is something that [top epidemiologist Neil Ferguson agrees with]( and he's the lead author of [the Imperial College report]( which has just changed the approach of the UK government.

If masks became plentiful it would also help the public. SE Asia and China have done well to control the spread. Maybe, just maybe, one of the reasons is that masks are more socially accepted in some SE Asian countries than in the rest of the world.

If you like this idea, please share.

 Can someone please explain the logic behind the face mask rules? By the way, I totally agree with the idea of wearing face masks and I‚Äôm not trying to say that I don‚Äôt understand the overall rule. Rather, what I don‚Äôt understand is where you do and don‚Äôt have to wear a mask. I understand that it‚Äôs difficult to wear a mask in a pub or restaurant when you‚Äôre eating or drinking, but needing to wear a mask in a shop but not a cinema, gym or office makes no sense to me. It makes so little sense that it‚Äôs difficult to remember where you should or shouldn‚Äôt wear a mask and it just makes the whole thing feel awkward. I suppose that‚Äôs why so many people are treating it as a joke (which they shouldn‚Äôt be, but I kind of understand why).

 Should i get a reuseable face mask and if so where can i get one? Basically i havent left the house since lockdown started. Not because im scared of the virus, I just havent needed to and barely left the house before all this started anyway.

 But im going to uni in September and they have said that face masks need to be worn in public buildings and so i need to have something by then. My dad bought some thin surgical looking masks (i dont know if they are actually surgical masks but they look like them) but they are washable and so presumably no reuseable.

I know you can get what im assuming are cotton masks? Im guessing these are reuseable. And so im wondering if i should get one of those. Like would it be cheaper in the long run  My only worry is if i would have to wash it every time i wore it.

Thanks, Jono

 Is our society to selfish to beat coronavirus? Seems that the UK is being run by politicians that do not see themselves as part of the society. 

In Singapore, Australisia and the government is concerned about the will of the people and are being open and honest with them. They are having 1 hour + press conferences live with 3-4 members of government. 

In typical fashion, we have a 30 second clip where our leaders follow a script that says we have a great NHS, and have everything undercontrol. 

This virus operates in a completely ruthless and in a very out of control manner. 

I know that in a crisis you will burn yourself out if you are constantly rehearsing scripts and are not being your natural self. 

Matt hancock is burning himself out and won't last alongwith the rest of them. 

If I was in charge I would immediately:

Cancel all flights to Iran, South Korea and Italy,Japan until they show they have no new cases for 2 days (like Hong Kong and Singapore) 

All schools are closed and turn them into field hospitals with oxygen for all beds. (I have a white paper that we need to follow to do that. (this will give capacity for the 250000 beds Scotland needs alone) we need that done now. 

I would immediately process a payment to all citizens of ¬£300 a month for the next 3 month's ( hong kong just did this and gave everyone ¬£1000) to stop panic)

I would be rapidly making a mask factory in every city. Masks do work to slow the spread. Even 5% helps - everyone on this thread needs to start wearing masks now to make it socially acceptable ASAP. 

I would remove all cash in circulation now and ask everyone to go cashless. Only Old people will be excused for now, be will be encouraged to use contact less. 

I would ban mass gatherings this should have been done last week. 

I would temporarily nationalise and take over all UK airlines as they will need them to get supplies across the country as food distributors will have difficulty with distribution in lock down. 

I would immediately be protecting the areas of the country that produces the most food. (So I would immediately be designating that entire area a special care zone to those areas) we only grow 60% of the uks food needs. If that is screwed we will have social unrest.




We are at WAR. 

I've never heard of a society winning a war being reactive. 

We must be proactive. 

Matt Hancock! if your monitoring this post. Imagine coronavirus was a bomb full of a bio weapon that is set to explode in 4 weeks and kill 5 million people.

 How to protect yourself from the crazies? Home defence So I live on the bad side of town next to a pub. I'm a little worried that my na and I are a bit of a target since we are right opposite the pub and people -who we don't know- often tell us about our house. Like, you'll be waiting in line for the till and someone will ask me "do you live there, omg I've seen you before" or on the bus "where's your grandmother, I always see you with her" 

It's a bit freaky especially since a lot of crazy people live around here. In recent days I've heard even more fighting than usual and just now we had a man screaming in the street, holding up traffic, yelling about the coronavirus. 

I've always been a little paranoid about home invasion. I'm a woman who loves true crime, I'm not obsessed or anything it just makes me feel better to have a safety plan incase anything dose happen. However things are different now, the police in this area are pretty shit as it is. They hardly show up when you call them as it is, so I'm not sure what to do if things get worse and some of these crazy people try to break in.

 Where any shielders actually socially distancing from other members of their household? Just seems impossibly hard and a better solution would be for the whole house to shield.

 The 36 Cities and Counties Where Cases are Rising. (Paywall) Telegraph Here's the link.
Unfortunately I did not pay to read. If anyone has I would be interested in knowing.
I feel like this shouldn't really be behind a Paywall, personally.

 People are panic buying because the government is doing NOTHING. Understandably, panic buying is worrying and frustrating and leaves certain at risk members of society unable to supply themselves with essentials. The responsibility needs to be put on the government, not each other, for causing the panic because most of us feel that the people in charge aren't doing anything to control the outbreak. If the government had anything under control there would be less need to panic.

 What is the endgame for lockdown? Anyone else not really understand why we are under lockdown? I mean, I‚Äôm following all the rules I just don‚Äôt really see what it achieves as surely the virus will spread through the population either way?

 COVID &amp; the workplace Posting for my boyfriend who works in a garage.

My boyfriend‚Äôs colleague tested positive on Friday evening for covid and he knows at least one member of staff has received the track and trace alert. This staff member has chosen to delete the app and says he can‚Äôt afford to go on SSP for 2 weeks. 

No one wears masks unless customers are around, however they work on vehicles so this could spread everything massively. The staff room is tiny and has no windows. I was expecting everyone to be isolating.

My gut instinct says everyone should be isolating and to report them if they don‚Äôt but the issue is everyone will know it‚Äôs him and they could make life very difficult for him (I worry he‚Äòd be first to be made redundant). 

I‚Äôm not sure what to do and was wondering if anyone had advice??

 Tier 3 shielding My area is looking like it will be in Tier 3. Looking at the details around that, there is not much difference between now and  tier 3 restrictions except for retail being open...

My partner is CEV and is currently shielding, and it isn't clear what is expected of her once we move from lockdown to Tier 3.

Some articles suggest she should return to work (primary school, reception) as normal whereas others are suggesting more advice to follow

Can anyone help clear this up?

 Asda are prioritising the first hour of shopping on Friday for nhs workers which is the same time they are also prioritising for the elderly and vulnerable, so people who are highly likely to be infected will be in there at the same time as the most vulnerable, isn't this a bad idea?

 Police are happy streets are empty I wonder how many police officers are enjoying exercising their rights over citizens at this time, I see so many smug tweets from departments with pictures of empty high streets and parks, like we should happy that everybody is inside, when in reality this is hell on many people who rely on going outside for health and social reasons. Why can't these departments see that this is a necessary yet despairing measure, not a free ride to roll around the town like the mob. üëç
