 Coworker tested positive and didn’t say anything... what do I do? Three weeks ago, I work at a bar and worked with this coworker 5 days before she tested positive. She tested positive and didn’t say anything to anyone until now. 

I got sick with what I assumed was a flu. No specific Coronavirus symptoms. I have been self isolating to the extreme. My boyfriend who also works with us. Got sick. Another coworker got Pneumonia. 

I’m angry that she didn’t say anything. I spent two weeks totally alone and now am with my family who is extremely Vulnerable to this virus. 

What can be done about this? Should I get tested now??

 Foods to fight covid-19  

If you feed sick do the following:

Try and get tested, and follow all directions of medical personnel.

If they won't test or have no medicine then you will need to understand the theory of the covid-19.

The best known treatment is hydrocloroquine which acts in two ways, first as a zinc ionophore to let zinc which is a proven anti-viral into the cells and second to reduce inflammation and manage immune response. If the first way is the primary active ingredient then there may be some foods that can help fight covid-19

1. Green Tea or if you have it dietary supplement ecgc which is a concentration of one component from green tea. Take the recommended dose. This is a zinc ionophore like hydrocloroquinine so do not exceed the normal high dose limit on the suplement. If you don't have greed tea you can substitute:

Tea: green, white, oolong, and black teas.

Fruits: cranberries, strawberries, blackberries, kiwis, cherries, pears, peaches, apples, and avocados

Nuts: pecans, pistachios, and hazelnuts

2) Take quercetin at the recommended dose, quercetin is a concentrated flavonoid which is again a concentrated food product. This is also a zinc ionophore like hydrocloroquine. If you don't have any quercetin you can substitute:

leafy vegetables,

broccoli,

red onions,

peppers,

apples,

grapes,

black tea,

green tea,

red wine

some fruit juices

3) Take some dietary zinc 30-50 mg. You naturally have zinc in your blood and pee out excess so you can't raise your blood level much and for normal healthy diets dietary zinc isn't needed, but lets be on the safe side. Some people have reactions above 50 mg zinc. If you don't have zinc the following foods are high in zinc:

Shellfish: oysters, crab, lobster

Beef

Poultry

Pork

[Legumes](

[Nuts]( seeds

[Whole grains](

Fortified breakfast cereals

4) Take vitamin D. This produces a 10% immune benefit. Foods high in vitamin D if you can't get a multi vitamin with D:

Foods that provide [vitamin D]( include:

Fatty fish, like tuna, mackerel, and salmon

Foods fortified with vitamin D, like some dairy products, orange juice, soy milk, and cereals

Beef [liver](

Cheese

Egg yolks

Sunlight outside (not through window)

5) Take 1000 mg vitamin C. Vitamin C is good for the immune system but the purpose of this is to keep the ecgc and quercetin from oxidizing and prolong the zinc oxidization effect. If you don't have vitamine C use:

* Broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower.
* Green and red peppers.
* Spinach, cabbage, turnip greens, and other leafy greens.
* Sweet and white potatoes.
* Tomatoes and tomato juice.
* Winter squash.
* Cantaloupe.
* Citrus **fruits** and juices, such as orange and grapefruit.
* Kiwi **fruit**.
* Mango.
* Papaya.
* Pineapple.
* Strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, and cranberries.
* Watermelon.

 I think my Dr. lied about testing be for COVID-19 Does anyone know if the same sample from a flu test can also be used for the COVID-19 test? For the flu test, I was swabbed just inside my nose but I heard that the COVID test is much more painful. Anyone have any insight? When I called up to my city’s health department, they told me they had no record of any test  of mine being sent to them but to continue to wait. About 2 weeks later I get a call from the hospital that tested me that my test was negative when u was told the health department would call me.

I feel as though I have been lied to and everyone is calling me paranoid.

 How to handle the work situation? Someone tested positive at work (a construction site), someone tested positive at my gf's work (an office), one of our neighbors tested positive. We now have scratchy throats. I called in sick today but I dont know what to do beyond that. My company has said nothing other than if you're positive, stay home for 2 weeks. 

But the area I'm in has such limited testing that they're reserving it for only severe cases that require hospitalization. I'm fairly sure me and my gf both have it but there's no way to prove it yet.

 How long after exposure should you get tested? After possible exposure to the coronavirus (ie coming into contact with someone who tested positive), should you wait 3-5 days to get tested so that the antibodies have time to develop, or will it not affect the results?

 Question about my situation... On Sunday my girlfriend got notified that one of her roomates that she went to the beach with tested positive for COVID. She was notified after I’ve kissed her so I decide to quarantine with her (lol). Later that day she gets tested and she tests positive, and I get tested as well and it turns out to be negative(both rapid &amp; 3-5 test). Originally I thought that I had a false negative because of how early i decided to test myself. Fast forward a couple days of me and her quarantining together and I decide to get tested again to see if I’m still negative, and I am. 

I’m now either confused with the testing accuracy or with how Coronavirus spreads because throughout that week I kissed her multiple times and I apparently didn’t contract anything. Does anyone know why?


Disclaimer: if this post was confusing please ask questions because i’ll try my best to clarify

 Question in regards to testing positive and retesting If you test positive for the corona virus, recover ... will you perpetually test positive again for the virus, or will your test move into negative status after your recovery ?

 Is it okay to be around a person that just tested POSITIVE for coronavirus when I’ve had it for almost 10 days ? I was tested positive for COVID-19 around 10 days ago my girlfriend came positive today, I haven’t been around her ever since I tested positive and I wasn’t the person giving it to her, is there a chance that seeing her might slow down my recovery?

 Management withholding positive test result info Before I say anything I just want to make it clear this post is not about knowing WHO the people were that had tested positive. 
I work at a restaurant, I was unaware until yesterday, the 23rd, that two of my coworkers had tested positive for the coronavirus, one on the 12th &amp; the other the 15th. My management, all the way up to our regional manager, were made aware of these positive results immediately, as per the employees own accounts of what occurred. There was no cleaning done, people who had associated closely with those who had tested positive requested time off from management to get tested, &amp; management denied this right. Along with that, it was a whole 7 days before anyone from management reached out to us to inform us of these cases. At this point, most people already knew but not everyone!!! And we should not be finding out this info thru coworkers, which most of us had to! It lead us to chaos &amp; misinformation. 
We have worked a lot of long hard hours thru this pandemic for this company. We are, above all, hurt that this is how they treated us &amp; our safety after all this dedication. 
With all this being said, several of us were wondering if pursuing legal action (filing a lawsuit) or filing complaints would be a possibility. With everything surrounding the coronavirus ever changing &amp; evolving, we are just not sure where to go from here. Any help or advice would be appreciated. Thank you.

 A Microcosm of Stupidity: First Hand Account So I work at a gas station. About a week ago my assistant manager took 4 days off because of flu-like symptoms.  She was not tested for covid-19.  Two days after she returned to work she got a call from the clinic she went to when she first noticed symptoms, now the clinic WANTS to test her for covid-19 but since our state does not have enough tests to test her currently, she can't immediately get testing done.  She filled me in on all of this today as I was getting off my shift, standing less than a foot away from me.

Fine. Tell the store-manager and self-quarantine for 2 weeks or until tests become available.  That's the reasonable response right?  

Wrong.

Our store manager tells her, and this is an exact quote..."Thanks for coming into work and biting the bullet, we really needed your help around the store.  What could you do anyway? There aren't enough tests right now. (Laughs)"  

The assistant manager is 55+, her co-worker for the day is a lady that just got out of the hospital for serious surgery that is 60+, and the store manager who is 50+.  I'm at a loss for how stupid this is.

So the place I work at is now a prime vector for travelers and people buying drinks and snacks and then traveling all over the place.  

Thanks boss.
