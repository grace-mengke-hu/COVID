 Taking Kids out of School Voluntarily: Our Principal's Response Today we informed the principal of our kids elementary school that we were taking out kids out of school due to the State of Emergency in Maryland and NIH's recommendation that we avoid large public gatherings. My wife and I then spoke to the Principal by phone. We explained that because of the lack of testing and and our ability to work from home we want to be part of the solution, rather than contributing to what could be a problem.

We understand that not everyone is a position to remove their kids from school, but by reducing the number of kids in school voluntarily we can help reduce the demands put on teachers and the threat to kids still in school and their families.  

We weren't sure how the school would respond. Would we need to withdrawal our kids and start homeschooling? Turns out they are fully supporting our decision and told us it would not affect our kids standing the classroom. Details still needs to be worked out so our kids stay current. The Board of Education is also in the middle of discussing all possible scenarios. 

We are sharing this conversation for anyone else that's also considering taking their kids out of school or thinks this could help in their local community.

 Dear Leaders, here's how to make a mask rule so that people stop dying, from a former school principal, just sayin... Dear Trump , Pence,  and Governors, In case you actually want  businesses to open and people to stop dying, here's a "primer" on how to make a rule that people care about and follow. If you do this, maybe we can stop watching our fellow citizens melting down at Trader Joes as thousands of our loved ones die needlessly.          

Making a rule that requires everyone to adopt a new behavior, such as wearing a mask, is possible, even in a culture that perceives the rule as an infraction of "their rights". I realize that some of you just don't give a crap about how many people are getting sick. Bust just in case, here you go...  Here's the philosophy, with  school examples:        



1) The rule must be enacted as both a "top-down" and a "grassroots" rule. **School Example:** "all students  at Roosevelt High School  must carry a pass when they travel throughout the school without an adult"                 

 The principal, the head dean, whoever is that top person, must "declare" that it is now a rule. - The teachers and staff must help to enforce it, and the students will have to buy into it. Here's the good news: it will work even if 5% of the community does not comply. This is based on the PBIS (positive behavior intervention supports) model.         

In some organizations, the leader must define the rule as "mandatory" , "legal" , or " critical"  in order to get compliance. If the leader says "encouraged" , you might as well forget the rule. **School Example:**  "Students, it is highly encouraged that you do not use your phone during class instruction."   VS. "Students, it is a mandatory, school-wide rule that you do not use your phone during instruction" . People may question, what is "mandatory" ?  They typically want to hear about the penalty of not following the rule. The good news is that the "penalty" might not need be that harsh, It might just be a big inconvenience.                   **School Example:** "Since we are having trouble following the students-must-carry-a- pass rule, we will have an assembly of all students at 2:00 Friday to review why it is important".                                                      

&amp;#x200B;

2) The leader(s) must give a rationale to everyone, to the people who dislike it the most (students) and to the people who will enforce it (staff). And the rationale must be based in data. School Example: "75% of our school disruptions come from students who leave areas without supervision, here is a graph of the last 500 discipline incidents, notice that 375 of these incidents were students who were traveling within the school without a pass, unsupervised. It is in all of our best interest to have students carry a pass that has been signed by staff."      



3) The leader(s) must be perceived by the community as following the rule themselves: School Example: If the school rule is "no wearing hats inside"  then all adults would have to refrain from wearing hats. ESPECIALLY THE PRINCIPAL .                                                                                                                                               

   4) The adherence, or following of the rule, must be continually be praised and publicly reported, along with the positive results.  School Example:   " This week I checked the hallways, and 90 out of 100 students I asked were carrying a pass. Thank you to all the teachers and students who are making a difference at Roosevelt High School."  This should include all of the other "enforcers" of the rule. "I want to thank Mr. Banks, Ms. Ramirez, and Ms. Chee as our "hallway pass superstars" of the week here at Roosevelt High School."



5) There must be a sense, perceived by all, that a continued disregard of the rule will be addressed. **School Example:** the teacher who continually ignores the rule must have a conversation with the principal, which will likely include a "verbal warning".  



6) Peer Pressure:  Eventually peer pressure must take over the "top-down" pressure. People will feel a sense of order, of fairness, of improvement, because of the collective effort of enacting the new rule. When others blatantly disregard the rule, the community will react with pressure to follow the rule .

 Within a week of reopening, kids at my school got corona. What will happen? So, like the title says, within a week of school reopening there are around 3-4 kids who have already gotten corona and the school has made around 30 kids quarantine.  Basically,  I am wondering if any of you have any insight as to what will happen in the future?  These kids likely spread the corona around the school already, and my guess is there will be more cases soon.  Is the school seriously just going to keep quarantining certain kids and repeat the cycle over and over until the pandemic ends?  I know it’s probably different for every school and varies depending on the area, but do you guys think school in general will last?  It seems very implausible to me.  Any insight will be greatly appreciated!
