 (1) Interactive COVID-19 map showing recent trends per county and (2) downloadable csv files with case and death counts per day for each county starting March 24 As a public service I produce an interactive map that uses COVID-19 data from Johns Hopkins University to tell at a glance whether the number of new cases or deaths in each county is trending up or trending down.  The information for the map is updated each night.

The symbols on the map summarize the recent trends as follows:

* Circle		Prior 14 days
* Triangle	        Prior 7 days
* Green		Good - numbers are trending down
* Red		Bad - numbers are trending up

Click any symbol for the prior 14 day counts for that country.  (A few symbols on the map represent cities.)

Open the map and show data about new cases:

[

The map has a number of overlays that you can turn on/off.  You can display data about recent cases or recent deaths.  The data can be displayed by county, by state or by country.

If you need help using the map, please read the **“Map tips”** (link in upper left corner).

The data that Johns Hopkins is curating is a cumulative count of cases and deaths for all counties in the USA.  You can find that data on their GitHub page at:

[

I wrote code that **converts the Johns Hopkins timeseries \*cumulative\* counts into \*daily\* counts of cases and deaths for all counties**.  These daily counts begin March 24th and are in csv files that anyone can download and import into GIS or spreadsheet software.  I made a PDF with details about (1) the interactive map and (2) these csv files.

 Is there any downside for using Hydroxychloroquine WITH Zinc Sulfate and Azithromycin against Covid-19 So I had a conservative friend trying to defend the use of Hydroxychloroquine WITH Zinc Sulfate and Azithromycin. He told me about an [article]( discussing that a NYU study shows that 450 patients with Covid-19 taking the three combo drug compared to 450 patients with Covid-19 taking Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin without Zinc Sulfate. The study shows that 1.5 people with the triple drug treatment have a better recovery compared to the double drug treatment. Every thing i have seen about Hydroxychloroquine online states that it is bad to be used alone but i do not see a lot of articles stating the reasons why the drug should not be used with Zinc Sulfate and Azithromycin, are there articles out there or tests that show the negative effects of using the triple drug treatment?
