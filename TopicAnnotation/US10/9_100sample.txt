 HealthCare Workers not Covered Under FFCRA. NO PAY HOME OVER A WEEK WITH COVID I work at a substance abuse treatment facility, I recently started there providing therapies to clients, in the middle of the pandemic. I contracted COVID-19. I worked from home for a few days but due to company policy I cannot work while being sick. They informed I would have to request unpaid time off. 

I called the US Department of Labor and healthcare workers are not covered under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act. 

AKA for people with no sick time or not enough sick time we just don’t get paid. This is absolutely ridiculous to exclude the demographic that needs this most. 

I am now home without pay, until further notice.

 Why are Accounting Firms considered essential? WI Since the tax deadline has been pushed back, why do accountants still have to go to work?

My husband is an accountant in WI and because of the upcoming lock-down he was provided a letter today saying he was an accountant and hence, an essential worker. I understand people need their tax refunds, however, he does mostly business taxes so not much of a return.

I'm confused and I can't ask him because he's working at the moment.

Thanks!

Shrek is the one true god, and Shrekhammad is his prophet!  The Coronavirus started in China, an Atheist country which hates the lord Shrek. It then spread quickly all over the world, worse than many other similar viruses. It also has a high mortality rate and has killed many people. This is divine punishment for infidels. Only loyal followers of Shrek will live. Convert now. Faithful servants will survive. Everyone else will not.

 On April 10 the Corona Virus task force showed a model that predicted around 60k deaths by August. 19 days later and we’re about to surpass this. Why is no one talking about this? On April 10 the task force told us the models were now trending downward and only up to 60k deaths by August. 19 days later and 4 months away from August and we’re about to surpass 60k deaths yet almost no one is talking about this. 

Why is this being ignored as more people are starting to push for the economy to open? How is it that Americans seem to be getting lulled into a false sense of security when we’re about to smash the model 4 months early? Anyone else starting to get worried that many Americans are trying to cling to hope by ignoring the truth?

 NATIONAL One Week Shelter-In-Place Order (I.e Quarantine) about to be given within the next week Two verified independent sources, one from the PA Governor’s office, and one from Department of Homeland Security, relay that the National Guard is being ordered to prepare for a 30-day deployment. While initial SIP Order will be for one week, it may be extended for up to 30 days. They are waiting for the announcement until military and National Guard are in place to prevent violent rioting. Families were advised to calmly pack and finalize shopping to prepare for up to a 30-day quarantine.

 Currently In the hospital with a newborn under 24 hrs old... So yesterday I went into labor and stayed home as long as possible. Our hospital had announced the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in isolation in their unit. I almost didn’t make it in time! Literally 10 minutes from entering the L&amp;D wing to baby’s arrival. The nurse staff is being very careful and kind, but I’ve never heard a hospital this quiet. A few other babies cries, but NO ONE talking in the halls, or walking in and out. No family visitors. Today the news announced 14 more patients here in this hospital now in isolation waiting for COVID-19 test results. We went from 1 to 14 in less than 24 hrs (although unconfirmed, I do realize). 


Then about 1 hr ago the nurse came in to check my baby’s vitals. Everything was fine! Doing great. I am not sick. No one in my family is sick (that we know of). And out of nowhere, my baby is running a fever of unknown origin... it may be nothing! Right? It may be a small infection, right? She is sleeping deeply. Right now her lungs are clear, oxygen levels are good I’m choosing to trust she will be fine. But there’s that thought... what if the man with iv and oxygen tubes, riding the elevator before us, what if he is now in isolation for COVID-19? What if within the first couple of hours of life, my new baby breathed it these deadly particles, now racing through her tiny body? 



If you pray, please Pray for my baby. I’m frightened. I want to go home. But I want her to be safe first.

 Mortality rate calculation I've been tracking this pandemic very closely, gathering data, generating non-linear curves, great.  


&amp;#x200B;

I'm having trouble rationalizing the mortality rate calculation, as of 3/30/2020 US is at 143071 total cases, 4856 recovered, 2513 dead leaving 135702 active cases.  


143071 inputs, 7369 outputs, of the outputs 66% are alive and 33% are dead.  


I don't think using a 1.7% mortality rate (2513 Dead/143071 Total Cases) tells the true story. Also, on the 27th the recovered vs dead was opposite, 33% recovered, 66% dead.

 I self reported and got in trouble for it. I was possibly exposed to the virus in a small, closed room.

I am a mid-level practitioner and once I got back to work, I called employee health and asked what to do (I was at a doctors appt during my lunch break and the doctor was sick. He was not wearing a mask and he acknowledged that 2 of his patients had tested positive but he assured me he thought he just had a cold).

Since I work at a hospital, I didnt want to be the one who exposed my coworkers or patients/visitors without telling anyone...so I called employee health (we have no procedure in place yet for this type of occurrence). 

They, rightfully, told me to put an N95 mask on, exit the nearest door, go home, stay home for 2 weeks and then get cleared by a physician to come back to work.

They said dont call your boss (my attending) until you exit the building. I did so and she LOST it. She has even gone so far to call my doctors office and demand him to take a COVID-19 test.

She then told me to keep coming in and just close the door to my work area, "dont talk to anyone," and wear a mask.

I'm so frustrated that I just did what I thought was the right thing, only to be made to feel like what I did was wrong. She even went so far to tell me, "you shouldn't have called them, you call me first."

I'm in an odd position where I'm employed by both the hospital and the doctors group. I have 2 sets of bosses basically but I was considering our patients needs first.

I feel like an asshole and everybody is mad. 

I didnt expose myself...so why do I feel like everyone is blaming me?

This whole thing is so fucked up. Potentially 2 weeks of with no pay and a boss that is VERY angry. 

This....this is why no one self reports. 

And I have no wine. Fml.

 Charter staff told to report to offices despite positive coronavirus tests 

I don't work in one of the impacted offices, but I do work for Charter/Spectrum overall. Since this article was posted, Charter has  updated to allow people 3 additional weeks paid sick time if they contract the Coronavirus or need to care for someone who has. 3 weeks. 

These are all for jobs that can be done remotely. Call centers. Back end operations. Things that all you need to do from home is a laptop, headset, and a VPN, and right now they are still requiring us to come into the office. If we discuss it on social media, we get blasted for violating our external communication policy. 

The final piece from the latest communication from CEO Tom Rutledge reads:

"In parallel, we are developing further plans for increased social distancing, specifically creating more space in some of our Field Operations, Customer Operations, Sales, Enterprise and Reach operating facilities, with the goals of ensuring continuity of critical services and support over what could potentially be many months ahead. More information on this will come out over the next few days.

In addition, without endangering our obligation to provide critical services, we plan to give an option to some employees, who can be productive remote from the office, to work from home for a period of time. We will provide more information on this over the next week."
