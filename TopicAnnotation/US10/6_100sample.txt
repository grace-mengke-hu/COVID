 DAILY UPDATE Coronavirus % growth for APRIL 18 - US confirmed cases and deaths are both starting to trend down Below is a summary of trends from yesterday (as of late EST), for the **USA**, and how it compares to **Global**.

The data is available [in more detail here]( I'm also elaborating on the data in a [nightly vlog]( with some highlighted threads from Reddit.

# Global

Confirmed Cases growth is **üìà**:

* Increasing to **3.56%**
* Increasing by **80,324**
* Total confirmed cases is **2,333,978**

Deaths growth is üìâ:

* Decreasing to **4.5%**
* Increasing by **6,905**
* Total deaths is **160,767**

Death Rate growth is mixed:

* **21.7%** recovery rate (**üìà**)
* **6.4%** WHO CFR (flat)
* **11.8%** incubation rate (üìâ)

# USA

Confirmed Cases growth is üìâ:

* Decreasing to **4.64%**
* Increasing by **32,491**
* Total confirmed cases is **732,197**

Deaths growth is üìâ:

* Decreasing to **5.1%**
* Increasing by **1,891**
* Total deaths is **38,664**

Death Rate growth is mixed:

* **37.4%** recovery rate (üìâ)
* **5.0%** WHO CFR (flat)
* **11.1%** incubation rate (üìâ)

**Disclaimer:** *Please take from this what you choose. I'm also individual country data, although that may still be too small to gather enough meaning from the % growth apart from Iran, Italy, Spain, France, the UK, and the US.*

*I am just breaking down official numbers, and although the official numbers may or may not reflect exactly how many cases remain unreported, I try to remain unopinionated in these reportings and leave the opinions and analysis to the comments.*

 Reporting price gouging to end product ‚Äúshortages‚Äù!! Are eBay and Amazon doing any kind of mass identifying on their end for people who are price gouging important supplies such as toilet paper and artificially creating shortages?

Until more is done, I do see that there is a Report ability for people to report individual posts. I‚Äôd encourage anyone bored at home to report report report to help end the shortage!!!

Example for toilet paper on eBay:
1. Click ‚ÄúReport This Item‚Äù (upper left corner on mobile)
2. Report Category: Prohibited and Restricted Items
3. Reason for Report: Price gouging
4. Detailed Reason: Sanitation Items

Any other ways for consumers to report price gouging?

 US Cases are doubling every 6 days on average I've been mapping this on my tiny hobby site since late January, and now that we're about to start testing for real here in the US it seemed like a good time to start looking at how many days pass before our case counts double. 

I have sources for all cases &amp; dates, so just ask if you have questions beyond what I've posted below.

**Days to Double:**

Summary: Average time between case count doubling in the US is 6 days. Our longest stretch was 16 days, which was when the first batch of Diamond Princess cases were confirmed.

|Cases|Date|Days to double|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|Jan 21|3|
|2|Jan 24|2|

**Assumptions:**

1. I'm including **all persons** in the US (i.e. Diamond Princess transports are included in my numbers)
2. Cases must have **tested** positive. No presumptions. No potential cases.

I'm tracking 66 current cases in the US. This includes:

 Confusion spreads over selection of priority groups for Covid-19 vaccines [deleted]
++++++++++
 Coronavirus death rates? We may never know how many people have contracted this Coronavirus and how many deaths are Coronavirus-related, especially those who have passed without having been tested. However, I share a genuine concern and curiousity regarding the death rates.

The reported death rates of 2%-8% for confirmed cases is a measurement of case fatality: confirmed deaths divided by confirmed cases. However, is this an accurate representation of how fatal the Coronavirus is, given that this metric includes individuals who had tested positive as early as yesterday and have not progressed far yet? For closed cases (recovered, discharged, death), that death rate is much higher at 21% (

Considerations for false-positive, false-negative, and differences in reporting aside, is the true death rate somewhere between these two metrics?

 US coronavirus cases double every 2-3 days I've been watching and recording the daily growth rate of COVID-19 in the US, and what I'm seeing is alarming. At the current rate it's growing, (about 36.5% daily avg) the number of cases doubles every 2-3 days.
What does that mean? 
Well, today (3/23) the US has 43,449 confirmed cases.
In 2 days (3/25), the US will have more cases than Italy.
By this weekend, the US will have more than double the cases of China.
If the growth rate does not slow down, in a month there will be 330 million cases...or 1 case for each person living in the US.

These are my own calculations and are based solely off the average growth of daily cases in the US since 3/5. This isn't to scare anyone, but I hope it helps a people realize just how quickly this is spreading and how important it is we slow the growth rate.

 "Public Health Advisor (Quarantine Program)" Insight? Everyone take a minute to look at this job posting on [USAJobs.gov](

[

I have a few questions with regards to the job posting "Public Health Advisor (Quarantine Program)".  
Under certain circumstances with the emergence of COVID-19 as a worldwide pandemic, is it a coincidence that the CDC posted this job on November 15th, 2019 a few days before the first COVID-19 case was reported in Wuhan? Based on current predictions, the number of COVID-19 cases will be at its greatest death toll around late June and early July. From current trends, the number of peak cases will be late April and early May. Is it a coincidence that the job application closes May 15th, 2020?

Is it a coincidence that there are "many vacancies" in places of large populace hubs in the United States? Places that are perfect for large scale quarantine camps. Places that will presumably exhibit a large amount of cases.

 Which way are things going? 

This map shows recent COVID-19 Trends with arrows that represent each county's recent trend history, and weekly new case counts for U.S. counties. 

The map data is updated weekly.

It shows COVID-19 Trend for the most recent Monday with a colored arrow for each county. The larger the arrow, the longer the county has had this trend.  An up arrow indicates the number of active cases continue upward. A down arrow indicates the number of active cases is going down.

The intent of this map is to give more context than just the current day of new data because daily data for COVID-19 cases is volatile and can be unreliable on the day it is first reported. Weekly summaries in the counts of new cases smooth out this volatility.

Click or tap on a county to see a history of trend changes and a weekly graph of new cases going back to February 1, 2020. 

This map is updated every Tuesday based on data through the previous Sunday.  [See also this version of the map]( for additional perspective.

COVID-19 Trends show how each county is doing and are updated daily. We base the trend assignment on the number of new cases in the past two weeks and the number of active cases per 100,000 people. To learn the details for how trends are assigned, see the [full methodology]( There are five trends:
* Emergent - New cases for the first time or in counties that have had zero new cases for 60 or more days.
* Spreading - Low to moderate rates of new cases each day. Likely controlled by local policies and individuals taking measures such as wearing masks and curtailing unnecessary activities.
* Epidemic - Accelerating and uncontrolled rates of new cases.
* Controlled - Very low rates of new cases.
* End Stage - One or fewer new cases every 5 days in larger populations and fewer in rural areas.

Summary:

The global financial crisis may have caused an additional 500,000 cancer deaths from 2008 to 2010, according to a new study, with patients locked out of treatment because of unemployment and healthcare cuts. The figures were extrapolated from an observed rise in cancer deaths for every percentage increase in unemployment, and every drop in public healthcare spending. "From our analysis we estimate that the economic crisis was associated with over 260,000 excess cancer deaths in the OECD (34-member Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) alone, between 2008-2010,"¬†

 Covid-19, What are the variables?   

Why now the corona virus pandemic?

One can say that it is because of the increase of the movement of people around the world that has helped spread the virus, but the Boeing 737 max crisis has removed hundreds of planes from circulation, making tickets more expensive and with a drop of movement of people.

The billions of Asians are accused with prejudice, of eating alternative foods and poor hygiene to feed themselves, but if we think logically, with the gigantic imports from the Americas to Asia, of animal and vegetable proteins, in reality these feeding trends must be going in the opposite direction.

So what are the variables? What do we have in 2020 that we didn't have in 17, 18 or 19?

Let's look back:

November 2019: Serial deaths alarm a Chinese city

December 2019: The new agent is identified (covid19)

March 2020 (today): We already have 7 thousand + tested deaths and the virus is being detected in practically all countries.

But let's reflect: It was only in December 2019 after the virus was identified that it was possible to create detection tests that are made using part of the virus's own DNA or an antibody from it.

In less than 80 days, test design, scale manufacturing, and distribution to all countries had to take place for the tests kits to be used as they are.

This happened quickly like never before. 

We found the variable.

Pandemics have existed before, air mass transportation has existed before, human-animal interaction has existed before. What we have new is the technology that was able to disseminate the tests more quickly than the virus making it possible for the first time a response, albeit late, but efficient to minimize the loss of human life.

One may ask: But why have so many people never died before?

This is where deception comes in: An British study estimates that in 2017 up to 650,000 people died of respiratory influenza worldwide. It is possible that this corona virus outbreak has already occurred before and has not been detected, accounting for the deaths of common flu/influenza.
++++++++++
 The soonest way out of this mess - widespread antibody testing Antibody testing shows who has it and who had it.

1) Knowing who has it lets them get treated quickly. Also allows contact tracing.

2) Knowing who had it lets them donate blood, to provide the antibodies to treat those who have it. This can be done very quickly and effectively.

Until we have cheap (free) widespread antibodies testing, I believe we will be shut in and playing wackamole with unpredictable outbreaks nationwide.

Unfortunately this will take a national strategy which we apparently can't muster under this administration.

 How testing failures allowed coronavirus to sweep the U.S. The linked [Politico article]( details that there was indeed a test kit ready and widely available prior to the pandemic spread in the US. The Trump administration rejected it. 

**Does anyone have a source detailing who in office made that decision?**

**I'm still looking for real documentation as to** ***why exactly*** **the US did not use the WHO test kit back when we could have avoided all that is coming?**

The article details that no one to date has answered these questions.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to avoid the tinhat flair, so I'll kindly ask my final questions this way:

**Does anyone have documentation on which companies are going to benefit through the production of the US test kits?** 

**Have they made any political contributions in the near recent past?**

&amp;#x200B;

**Quote from the article:**

"On Saturday Jan. 11 ‚Äî a month and a half before the first Covid-19 case not linked to travel was diagnosed in the United States ‚Äî Chinese scientists posted the genome of the mysterious new virus, and within a week virologists in Berlin had produced the first diagnostic test for the disease.

Soon after, researchers in other nations rolled out their own tests, too, sometimes with different genetic targets. By the end of February, the World Health Organization had shipped tests to nearly 60 countries.

The United States was not among them.

Why the United States declined to use the WHO test, even temporarily as a bridge until the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention could produce its own test, remains a perplexing question and the key to the Trump administration‚Äôs failure to provide enough tests to identify the coronavirus infections before they could be passed on..."

 A list of the most common comorbidities in Covid-related deaths and the percentage of the US adult population with each comorbity. For those people arguing (or even thinking) that Americans need to get back to work and lift stay at home orders for the sake of the economy because "only" people with pre-existing comorbidities are dying from Covid, this is a list of the comorbidities at play, along with the percentage of the US adult population with each comorbity. I am using New York's death statistics.

87% of Covid deaths in NY involved people with at least 1 comorbidity.

 Does anyone know if the FDA has been looking into approving the South Korea company‚Äôs testing kits? Every other day it seems we hear something new regarding issues with testing in the US. First the CDC sent botched tests, then there weren‚Äôt enough tests, then private companies got engaged to help but realized they don‚Äôt have the necessary materials to perform the testing. Meanwhile, ahem, we know South Korea has an automated test that works fast and would be so much more efficient. 

Does anyone know if the FDA is looking into approving the South Korea company‚Äôs testing kits? We clearly need backup plans to the backup plan. Every day that goes by without adequate testing sets us back so much and so many lives are at stake.

 World Health Organization - Where is their data coming from? So, I've noticed the numbers in their daily situation reports aren't matching news reports.    


I wanted to find the source of the WHO data, but after an hour of looking all I can find is:  
"Data as reported by national authorities" and   
"WHO COVID-19 Situation Reports present official counts of confirmed COVID-19 cases, thus differences between WHO reports and other sources of COVID-19 data using different inclusion criteria and different data cutoff times are to be expected "  


I've read multiple reports that we have no national tracking on numbers.  

I've seen articles referencing a new york times database and a John Hopkins database.

The CDC says " \* Data include both confirmed and  presumptive positive cases of COVID-19 reported to CDC or tested at CDC  since January 21, 2020, with the exception of testing results for  persons repatriated to the United States from Wuhan, China and Japan.  State and local public health departments are now testing and publicly  reporting their cases. In the event of a discrepancy between CDC cases  and cases reported by state and local public health officials, data  reported by states should be considered the most up to date. "  


So, why is WHO burying where they actually get the data from?  Are they getting it from each of the 50 states?   


Thanks for any insight.

 Good info on how to read pandemic statistics [Worldometers.com]( currently reporting a [5.8% case fatality rate in Wuhan]( Current scientific research places the [case fatality rate at 1.4% in Wuhan.](

At the same time, Worldometers does a fantastic job of discussing the inherent problems that go along with pandemic-related statistics:

*"At present, it is tempting to estimate the case fatality rate by dividing the number of known deaths by the number of confirmed cases. The resulting number, however,* ***does not represent*** ***the true case fatality rate and might be off by orders of magnitude..."***

***A precise estimate of the case fatality rate is therefore impossible at present***\*."\*

*"But* ***while an epidemic is still ongoing***\*, as it is the case with the current novel coronavirus outbreak,\* ***this formula is, at the very least, "na√Øve"*** \*and can be "\****misleading*** *if, at the time of analysis, the outcome is unknown for a non negligible proportion of patients."*

 Calculations Comparing the Worst Recent Flu Season (2017-2018) in the US (since 2003) to the Projected Coronavirus Numbers for the First Year (Infections, Hospitalizations, and Deaths) The 2017-2018 flu season was the most severe on recent record (since 2003). I wanted to see how that would compare to the projected COVID-19 forecasts to understand the scope of the problem we're facing.

Below is a chart that shows the numbers of flu cases, hospitalizations, and deaths for the 2017-2018 flu season (which contains data for an entire year), in addition to the projected forecasts for the first year of the COVID-19 outbreak.

 | **2017-2018 Flu Season** | **COVID-19** (20% infection) | **COVID-19** (60% infection)
:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:
**Cases** | 45,000,000 | 42,000,000 | 126,000,000
**Hospitalizations** | 840,000 | 4,200,000 | 25,200,000
**Deaths** | 61,000 | 420,000 | 1,260,000

The [historical flu numbers]( come from the CDC. The COVID-19 projections come from the Harvard epidemiologist featured in the [the Atlantic article]( who projected 40-70% of **adults** would get COVID-19 within the first year. Marc Lipsitch has now since [projected a lower range of 20-60% adults]( in comments on Twitter. I used 210,000,000 for the number of adults in the US population. I used a 20% rate for COVID-19 hospitalizations and a conservative 1% fatality rate for COVID-19 (the WHO has projected a higher number, but I figure 1% is easy to multiply depending on your particular brand of doom and gloom).

A different - and maybe more meaningful - way to look at the data is to look at equivalent number of cases. So basically, if you have 1500 people get infected, how would things shake out for both illnesses?

 | **2017-2018 Flu Season** | **COVID-19** 
:--------:|:--------:|:---------:
**Cases** | 1500 | 1500 
**Hospitalizations** | 110 | 300
**Deaths** | 2 | 15 

So basically, if 1500 had been infected in 2017-2018 with the flu, 110 would have need hospital treatment and 2 would have died. For COVID-19 in the same area, 300 would need hospital treatment and 15 would likely die.

Unfortunately, that direct comparison likely underestimates the problem. COVID-19 is not projected to only infect 14% of the population. It is projected to infect 20-60% of adults, or 15-45% of the population, which is roughly 1.1 to 3.2 times the number of infected in 2017-2018 flu season. So if we look at it by equivalent location, it might look something like this:

 | **2017-2018 Flu Season** | **COVID-19** (20% infection) | **COVID-19** (60% infection)
:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:
**Cases** | 1500 | 1650 | 4800
**Hospitalizations** | 110 | 330 | 960
**Deaths** | 2 | 17 | 48

So basically, in 2017, if you lived in an area where 1500 people caught the flu (a town of around 11,000 people), 110 would have ended up in the hospital, and 2 would have died. For COVID-19 in the same area, you could expect between 1650-4800 adults catching the disease, between 330-960 adults in the hospital, and between 17-48 deaths. 

Note: These estimates do not factor in COVID-19 infections in children under 18 years of age.

Please let me know if I have made a math error or if new information challenges these numbers. I am more than willing to revise the numbers, add columns, whatever.

 Where are vital statistics for US 2020? There are people who believe that the death rate really hasn't gone up due to covid. They say, "well, maybe deaths in March 2019 were the same as March 2020". They base this fact on how they can't find the total deaths each month in the US for 2019 and 2020. I know a few of them and want to disprove their claims. I want to compare deaths during a time without covid to a time with covid. I tried to search for this data, but also can't find it. The best I can do is find total deaths in Jan, Feb, and March 2019. But I can't find any data after March 2019.

Shouldn't these be available as vital stats? I see media reports that deaths are up, but where are they getting the data to base this on if it isn't posted anywhere to fact check?

 Can we give an experimental vaccine to our health workers if it's safe? I am not a scientist so this is just a thought of mine. Right now a few companies have started phase 1 clinical trials for their COVID-19 vaccine. For example, Moderna has begun their vaccine clinical trials a few weeks ago. As I understood, the phase 1 study is just to make sure the vaccine is safe that there are no side/negative effects on humans. So I think, if a vaccine passed phase 1 study, can we just give it to some people who need it badly, e.g., our health workers (doctors, nurses, clinicians...). These people are the heroes now and they are at very high risk with exposure to COVID-19 patients. Can we give them an additional protection with an experimental vaccine which passed phase 1?

I'm not saying the health workers do not use other protection (PPE) with the experimental vaccine, since the vaccine may not have enough efficacy. But if it does no harm to human's health, it can be a secondary protection for the most important people now. What can we lose?

Personally I would participate in phase 2 clinical trials for any COVID-19 vaccine.
