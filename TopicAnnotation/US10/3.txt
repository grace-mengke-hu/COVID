 Other Florida locals concerned about Ultra music festival in Miami in 3 weeks? Are there fellow Floridians here who are concerned about the amount of people who travel in for Ultra?

It's estimated that 170,000 people were in attendance last year and it's been said that people travel from over 100 different countries for Ultra. This is FL's first major music festival of the season and is a major health concern and asking for more transmission to locals and travelers alike. (Okeechobee Music Festival being a concern as well, but not nearly as mainstream as Ultra). There are events the whole week leading up to Ultra, as well. My plan to to email the officials of Miami. If this concerns you, I suggest you do too!
