 Side Effects We did such a good job, always wearing masks, avoided congregating with people, especially the older folks in the family. No one has gotten sick, so yay fam! 

But tonight I lost someone very dear to me, non-covid related. I spent so much time worrying that I could pass on the virus that I didn't stop to think I was missing their last good days. I regret that so so much. Maybe we can't hug everyone we want to, but make an effort to be present in the lives of those you care about, especially the elderly. You never know how much time is left. #FuckCovid

 Will you still get a stimulus check if you filed your own taxes even if your parent claimed you as a dependent? I’m a 20 yr old college student and have been filing my taxes for 2 years now. I didn’t even know my mom was still claiming me as a dependent until they released the stipulations for the coronavirus stimulus package. Just because I’m listed as a dependent doesn’t mean I’m fully dependent on her. I have a car that I pay for, I pay for my clothes and all other basic living expenses, I even give her extra money to help out when I can. Now I can’t work so I can’t even do the bare minimum to sustain myself. It’s bullshit.

 STIMULUS CHECK QUESTION So i’ve been filing my own taxes for the past 5 years. I’m also a college student but live on my own. On my tax returns, I have marked that someone can claim me as a dependent. I was unaware my parents have not claimed me as a dependent in 2018 or 2019. Will I receive a check? Will they look at my return and see I said someone could claim me or would they see that I was never claimed by anyone else and send me one? Very confused right now.

 I lost both of my parents to Covid -19. PLEASE WEAR MASKS 

My parents were older, both in their 60s. My mother was perfectly healthy ( despite a bit overweight) and my father had hypertension, but other than that he was healthy. After they tested positive their healthy just quickly deteriorated and I didn’t even have time to react they were just gone. This virus is no joke.

 Mattress Firm is Taking Advantage of the Coronavirus to NOT PAY RENT Mattress Firm is my tenant. They have just sent letter to all tenant requesting THREE MONTHS FREE RENT. This is goddamned OUTRAGEOUS!!!

We are only 10 days into this, and they want THREE FUCKING MONTHS FREE!!!! 

If my BANK eats THREE MONTHS of Mortgage payments, maybe. But will they? NO!!

If they simply had a down month or two, they would continue to pay the rent as prescibed in the LEASE. 

They put me throught their bankrupcy hell last year- and got a reduction then - now this. 

All I can say is FU Mattress Firm. 

Pay the rent. Pay the damn rent. YOU GO  get YOUR money from somewhere else. PAY THE FUCKING RENT

 Neighbor has in-window AC unit. Risk factor? In my apartment, my neighbor has an AC unit in their window which is right next to one of my windows. Like, less than 6 feet distance.

Does this post a threat to me and my household if I leave my window open? Or is it safe to have my window open?

 How to cope with a family member who has come into contact with covid? Hello I'm 18 years old and I just woke up to a text this morning from my grandmother saying my grandfather has come into contact with the coronavirus. I always knew it was bound to happen but now that it's become a reality I feel numb and I don't know what to do. My grandfather is diabetic and my grandmother has smoked her whole life. They are the only family I have and I am terrified I might lose them.
 
I usually stay at my boyfriends for a few days though the week and now I can't go back home to see them. My grandmother told me not to come back home and I'm terrified I won't be able to see them again.
  
What makes me the most upset is the day prior a coworker of my grandfather's was joking about how his brothers wife had the virus with two other workers. My grandfather at the time did not know about this and took the possibly infected man home. My grandfather found out this morning from another coworker that the infected man was joking about how his brothers wife had came into contact with it.
 
Am I just over reacting? I don't know how to feel about the whole thing. A part of me wants to sit and cry but I know that won't and can't change anything. How can I cope with this in the most healthy way possible?

 Any idea when the “national emergency”will end? I have cobra decisions to make. My cobra letter says I have 60 days past the end of the national emergency to send in my cobra election form. I’m hoping to have a new job within 2 months, so I’m not going to rush to send it in. If I need to use the coverage I can send it in and will just owe the back premiums. If I don’t need it, then that’s good!  I only have 60 days to decide to enroll in the marketplace coverage which is cheaper. If the national emergency goes until oct 31, would be able to let it ride and pick up coverage for January. (Hopefully I have a new job by then anyway!)

I would only pay for it if I have a serious claim, out of pocket would be cheaper for a dr visit or 2, or 3...

Having an idea of the timing of the emergency would be nice!
