**Disclaimer:** *Please take from this what you choose. I'm also capturing individual country data, although that may still be too small to gather enough meaning from the % growth apart from Germany, Iran, Italy, Spain, France, the UK, and the US.*

*I am just breaking down official numbers, and although the official numbers may or may not reflect exactly how many cases remain unreported, I try to remain unopinionated in these reportings and leave the opinions and analysis to the comments.*
