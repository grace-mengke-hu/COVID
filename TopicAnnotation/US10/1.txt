 Is there a point in continuing to pretend that covid will be contained in the USA? All this about wearing a mask and changing our lives - well if covid is going to infect everyone in the USA anyway then why am I supposed to bother trying to avoid it? The cat is out of the bag right?

 why not wearing masks?   

I don’t really know why not wearing a mask in US?

Reason 1: experts say “if you’re healthy, you don’t need to wear a mask”

But in Taiwan, they contain virus pretty well. 

The only difference between US and Taiwan is wearing masks.

You maybe say Taiwan is island so it’s easy to isolate virus from the outside of their border.

But US is also a BIG ISLAND from china.

You maybe say Taiwan's medical environment is good enough to take care of and manage patients,

But Europe’s is also good enough at the early stage. 

 

Reason 2: shortage of masks

but there are other substitute materials to make homemade masks. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wonder to know what are the reasons of not wearing masks in US?

 Looking for a new protective mask - thoughts on the Honeywell Dual Layer Face Mask? Would this [Honeywell Dual Layer Face Mask]( be better than a standard mask? How does it compare to a N95?

Take steps to help protect yourself and others while remaining comfortable in the Honeywell Dual-Layer Face Cover with replaceable high-quality filters. When used together, the Honeywell Dual-Layer Face Cover and filters block penetration and provide enhanced filtration of aerosol droplets more effectively than common cloth face coverings.

The Honeywell Dual-Layer Face Cover is an innovative fabric face covering design with enhanced functionality. Not all face coverings provide the same level of filtration. 

Filtration Efficiency is the ratio of the amount of bacterial aerosols challenging a mask versus the amount able to penetrate the mask. Bacterial Filtration Efficiency (BFE) and Particulate Filtration Efficiency (PFE) ratios evaluate the ability of a face covering to keep aerosol droplets – caused by others’ talking, coughing, and sneezing – away from the wearer’s mouth and nose, as well as the ability to prevent aerosols from the wearer’s mouth from reaching the environment. Appropriately fitted, the Honeywell Dual Layer Face Cover together with this filter block ≥98% of 0.3-micron-sized particles (BFE) and 0.1-micron-sized particles (PFE).

 Tips for wearing something over your mouth and nose when in public and around people. There's a lot of debate on right now about whether the general public should be wearing masks when out in public and around other people. One main concern against is that there are not enough masks and the masks that are available should go to healthcare workers to get the best utility out of them. I completely believe this but that does not mean that the general public shouldn't find other means to cover their nose and mouth in public. If you can't make your own fancy mask, cut up a t-shirt so that you can tie it around your face (two layers is better than one). Cut some upper and lower ties. If enough people do this, others will think "Hey, I can do that too."

Another concern about the general public wearing masks is that there is potential for mishandling leading to self inoculation. Here are some tips for wearing a mask:
* Continue to follow other CDC guidelines (social distancing, hand washing, etc). Wearing a mask does not give you cart blanche to get into a crowd and party.
* Wash your hands before and after putting the mask on. The best is to put it on at home and leave it on until you get back home. Don't put it on the car or anywhere else when your hands might already be contaminated.
* DO NOT TOUCH THE MASK while you are wearing it. If you need to cough or sneeze, just do it right into the mask (into your arm). Don't remove the mask to use tissue paper. If you need to take it off, have a plastic bag to put it in, put it into your pocket to take home. Wash your hands. If you are coughing a lot, stay home.
* Wash your mask after each use. Consider it contaminated after each use. Only put on clean masks. 
* If you are still going to work, this gets hard since you'll need to eat and drink. I don't know of a good solution other than make yourself several masks for the day. Don't lift up your mask to eat or drink. Don't wear it around your neck. Best to just take it off and put it in a bag to take home to wash.

Here are the potential benefits for those not keeping up with the discussions:
* It decreases the chance of you accidentally touching your nose and mouth when your hands might be contaminated. The mask is a conscious reminder for you not to touch your face.
* If you are an asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic carrier, it can help mitigate spread when you cough, sneeze or talk.
* It acts as a barrier if you happen to be around someone who coughs, sneezes or talks. It may not prevent you from getting infected, but it can decrease the risk.

 The perplexing non-mask wearers... I saw an interview with people in Italy who asked,  “Don’t the Americans care about their health?” The Italians  were referring  to Americans rebelling against wearing masks.  Personally , I do not LIKE wearing masks, but I wear them because science says they keep us safer/healthier.  So, I put on the mask faithfully, especially before I walk into a store.  Yet despite the signs plastered all over stores’ doors and walls, I’m still seeing people with their noses uncovered, with masks flapping under their chins, with masks that make no sense whatsoever (Halloween masks, face shields without masks underneath, and today—not sure what it was, a little tiny square of plastic   half the size of a credit card, suspended in front of someone’s mouth). Of course, the worst is people with no masks at all.  So I ask you—how do you feel about similar situations you’ve encountered, and what if anything do you do about  it?

 Mandatory mask wearing compared to mandatory Speed Limits  

Saying "I have my rights, even though the mandate says "wear a mask", I can't wear a mask" is the equivalent of saying "I have my rights, even though the mandated speed limit says 55 mph, I can drive 90 if I want".

Literally every part of the Mask argument can be correlated with the speed limit argument.

"I can't wear a mask, I have a "health issue" ", is the same as saying "I can't drive at the speed limit, my eyesight is bad, and I can't see the sign." The speeder with bad eyesight would get pulled over and get his driver's license revoked or at the bare minimum receive a ticket because he/she could hurt themself or others. In the same way, the person with the supposed "health condition" would be hurting themself and/or others, and should be fined because of that.

"Masks should be a personal choice, not a government requirement" is the same as saying "How fast you want to go on the road should be a personal choice." Of course most people would say that you shouldn't be able to go 120 mph down the freeway, as you might hurt someone. The same thing applies to masks. People shouldn't be allowed to not wear masks, as they might hurt someone.

"Masks probably don't work anyways, why should I wear them" is the same as saying "Speed limits probably don't work anyways, why should I follow them". In 1973 Congress passed a law that lowered the federal speed limit to 55. In 1995, it got repealed, and since then there has been an extra 12,545 deaths (link: [ ) due to the higher speed limits. If everyone would just wear a mask, there would be less deaths, the same as if everyone just followed the speed limit.

"Only sick people need masks" is the same thing as "Only those who speed a lot need speed limits" . You might be the best social distancer around, but you might cough or sneeze by accident, and there is no telling if you're an asymptomatic carrier of COVID-19, and a mask would prevent or at least hamper transmission of the virus. Same with speeding. You might be distracted at the wheel, and that speedometer might go up to 90 mph cause you leaned in on the acceleration pedal. But just because that was your first speeding violation doesn't give you a right to just opt out of following the rules.

This list could go on and on, but whenever an Anti-masker tries to argue with you about wearing masks, just bring up speed limits and compare masks with that.

Hope I helped someone's argument, or at least gave you a good read.

 Let's say I buy a bag of chips, I wash my hands, open the bag of chips and start eating... At any point after me opening the bag of chips, could I have gotten the virus from it being on the bag? Should I sanitize my hands *after* opening the bag as well? Even if I just washed them? or is that overkill?

Does soap/sanitizer keep killing bacteria, viruses for a good while after applying?
