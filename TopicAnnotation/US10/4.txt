 Too risky to fly back to college? Hi all, hope everyone is staying safe.

I will be traveling back to school in about a month. I am considering flying versus driving. Do you think flying would be too risky? Flight would be less than 3 hours. On the other hand, driving will take roughly 20 hours. Thanks in advance for the input

 Can someone explain to me about negative pressure in the hospital rooms for COVID patients? Thank you.  My MIL was in hospital for COVID and had to endure the noisy negative pressure.  She survived and is back home, but what does that do?

 HELP: If I take a Covid PCR test 84 hours before my flight, but the results are received 70 hours before my flight, and the results are reported 62 hours before my flight, will I still be accepted for my international flight requirement of “negative test results within 72 hours”? I have a round-trip flight at 10:50PM on Thursday, and my airline requires that I have a COVID-19 negative test result no older than 72 hours before departure. 

Does this mean that my test result needs to be **released** within 72 hours of my flight, or **collected** within 72 hours of my flight? Because the place I’m going to tomorrow, sends the COVID tests the next morning to be tested. 

I currently have an appointment for PCR test tomorrow, and another elsewhere on Tuesday to be safe. Even though the test tomorrow isn’t within 72 hours of my flight, it is still within 3 calendar days (Monday+3 days=Thursday). 

I apologize if it seems confusing how I’m asking it. 

P.S. Flight is from JFK to Dhaka (Bangladesh) with Turkish Airlines.

 Hospitals consider universal do-not-resuscitate orders for coronavirus patients Not a done deal but being discussed in multiple Hospitals.  Seems like each hospital is considering different methods to apply this and when to apply it (or whether to apply it at all) but bottom line they're in a position to see what's coming and the fact that they have to consider it at all should be very disturbing for us.

 Are airports/airplanes safe at this moment or is cancelling your flight the right thing to do? My grandmother has a flight to Oregon from LAX tonight she's been considering cancelling the flight. Should I advise her to stay home?

 You can save a life. Light sniffles?... Stay at home.  
Mild headache?... Stay at home.  
Occasional cough?... Stay at home.  
Scratchy throat?... Stay at home.  
99.6° degree temperature?... Stay at home.  
Feeling so-so?... Stay at home.

To you, it may be a mild cold, but to the person next to you it could be the end of their life.

 Flying or driving from MA to GA? Due to personal / family reasons, I have to go down to GA. I’m debating on flying or driving. I really don’t want to drive 16 hours, but I also want to minimize my chances of catching COVID. 

Would my chances of flying from Boston MA into Jacksonville FL (then driving up to GA) or driving directly to GA be safer? I’m in my young 20s and very healthy but I want to be as responsible as possible (I know most of you will say don’t go then but I don’t have a choice).
