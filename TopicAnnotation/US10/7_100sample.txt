 How long after exposure should you get tested? After possible exposure to the coronavirus (ie coming into contact with someone who tested positive), should you wait 3-5 days to get tested so that the antibodies have time to develop, or will it not affect the results?

 Question in regards to testing positive and retesting If you test positive for the corona virus, recover ... will you perpetually test positive again for the virus, or will your test move into negative status after your recovery ?
++++++++++
 I am almost positive I had the corona virus. I am almost positive I had the corona virus early February of this year. 

I work with kids and they had the flu. All the girls I work with had flu B. I went to the doctor at feeling the worst I’ve ever felt in my life and tested for the flu. However during the illness, I was surprised how hit I was and how the young children I work with were not as impacted. 

I tested negative for both flu A and B. I didn’t have much coughing, but I had horrible throat pain, fever, and couldn’t breath at times. Is there anyway I can test to see if I had it?? I’m in Chicago Illinois! 

Thanks!

 My girlfriend hasn’t been able to taste/smell for 1 month and 2 weeks as of last Thursday. Has anyone else experienced this or know of this from the virus? She cannot get tested as every test site we went to (we live on PA) say since she’s young and not at risk (23yo) they won’t test her, but all sites have said they assume she has it. I think it’s crazy how long this symptom has lasted. I (27yo) developed symptoms around the same time as her but I only had body aches some minor chest discomfort and fatigue.

 strep AND covid-19?? hi i was just at an urgent care yesterday for swollen tonsils, including lots of phlegm. i was tested for strep and covid-19 at the same time. i tested positive for strep, but the nurse said they’re gonna go ahead and run the covid test, but it will come back in a few days. she said they were gonna run it bc i had some symptoms that weren’t usually strep symptoms. would it be possible to have both strep and corona? i’ve googled it and i can’t find anything.

 Does sense of smell return after Coronavirus infection? I started feeling ill in mid March and had moderate symptoms for 2 weeks, including cough, sore throat, sinus pressure, fatigue, aches, and headaches. All those symptoms have gone away except *I still have no sense of smell*. 

Like not even a little bit of smelling, just none. I can’t smell anything! I don’t have any mucus, stuffy nose or sinus symptoms. 

Is my sense of smell ever going to come back?? It’s been weeks without smelling and it’s freaking me out. 

I was not diagnosed with Covid, it’s very difficult to get tested in NY, but I think I had it based on the symptoms.

 Tested positive for antibodies today. My only symptom was loss of smell. I KNEW I had it. I live in Los Angeles and was refused a test by my doctor last month via video appointment. He told me loss of smell wasn’t a symptom and I was refused a test. I told him I had 5 roommates and thought it was important I knew if I was a carrier but nope. Anyways, I couldn’t smell ANYTHING for over a week. It was so weird. Not even Apple cider vinegar right from the bottle!

My sister in another state also tested positive but she actually had flu symptoms along with loss of smell. Her bf just had a headache and Loss of smell. I’m not sure where/when I got it but I’m happy I have the antibodies now. My doctor said he knew I’d test positive as soon as I mentioned the smell thing.

 Is it okay to be around a person that just tested POSITIVE for coronavirus when I’ve had it for almost 10 days ? I was tested positive for COVID-19 around 10 days ago my girlfriend came positive today, I haven’t been around her ever since I tested positive and I wasn’t the person giving it to her, is there a chance that seeing her might slow down my recovery?

 Question about my situation... On Sunday my girlfriend got notified that one of her roomates that she went to the beach with tested positive for COVID. She was notified after I’ve kissed her so I decide to quarantine with her (lol). Later that day she gets tested and she tests positive, and I get tested as well and it turns out to be negative(both rapid &amp; 3-5 test). Originally I thought that I had a false negative because of how early i decided to test myself. Fast forward a couple days of me and her quarantining together and I decide to get tested again to see if I’m still negative, and I am. 

I’m now either confused with the testing accuracy or with how Coronavirus spreads because throughout that week I kissed her multiple times and I apparently didn’t contract anything. Does anyone know why?

 How do you know who tested positive or negative if no one asks or checks? Last month my workplace had two people test positive for covid. Everyone had to get tested including myself. Thankfully I came back negative and I returned to work based upon what HR mandated...

But no one asked for my test results. And I mean NO ONE. When I got my results I called my boss to let him know. I asked him how I should send my results to him via email or text and he said he didn't need them. So I just went back to work like I said along with everyone else except the two who tested positive. They sat out awhile longer. I never received any verification of how my fellow coworkers tested. In fact, no one said anything. When I brought it up to another supervisor in store they simply said that in order to come back to work the employees needed to test negative. 

Fast forward to the past week. Another positive case and we all have to get tested again. I got a call from HR letting me know the same routine and earliest I can return to work etc. But my main concern is this. Think about it. What if a worker got tested, it came back positive, but they were asymptomatic and felt fine? What if they just thought "I feel and look fine. I don't feel sick at all. I will just go back when HR says so." And don't rule out selfishness here. So I ask a question that I pretty much know the answer to: do I have the right to ask for proof of everyone's test results? (I assume not because of pRiVaCy). I don't want to go back to work and one of my coworkers tested positive and puts me and others at risk. What are your thoughts?
++++++++++
 Coronavirus I have a couple questions about this. 

Will we only get tests if we are showing symptoms? 
Someone I know needed to transfer a patient who has coronavirus.  Will they get a test if they said they had close exposure, or only if they have symptoms?

Also, if they do test positive, will they be told to just quarantine, or will they go to the hospital?

 Coworker tested positive and didn’t say anything... what do I do? Three weeks ago, I work at a bar and worked with this coworker 5 days before she tested positive. She tested positive and didn’t say anything to anyone until now. 

I got sick with what I assumed was a flu. No specific Coronavirus symptoms. I have been self isolating to the extreme. My boyfriend who also works with us. Got sick. Another coworker got Pneumonia. 

I’m angry that she didn’t say anything. I spent two weeks totally alone and now am with my family who is extremely Vulnerable to this virus. 

What can be done about this? Should I get tested now??

 From a healthcare worker in Long Island who is back at work after having COVID- what are your symptoms? For those inquiring about the sequence of symptoms:

Symptoms started on Feb 15th. Very sore throat for 4-5 days and aches with mild fever. I was able to work during this time (and spread it to others). It then developed into severe dyspnea with cough and ear pain (otitis media with effusion). I went to urgent care on Feb 19th and was prescribed a steroid, inhaler, Flonase and Claritin. I tested negative for the flu. I was told that I had an “unknown upper respiratory infection.” 
Fast-forward to today; lingering dry cough and mild lethargy. Since I am past the 14 day incubation I am back at work, but three people within my department have now tested positive with the EXACT same sequence of symptoms. My husband also had it. He has a notoriously badass immune system... he presented with headaches and mild cough with nocturnal dyspnea. 
Anyone else in NYC area experienced the same or similar symptoms before/after testing positive?

 3 coworkers called out sick. Just wanted to vent because I don't know what to do.
I work at a small vet clinic. We have had one coworker text us saying they had all the classic symptoms. Got tested yesterday but we wont know the results 3-5 days from now. They were told by the people who tested her to self iosolate for 7 days. Two others called out sick with fever. We are going to be short staffed for awhile. And im just waiting to get sick myself. Im just wondering what my boss will do once a good chunk of us is out. Or if my coworker does test positive. I wish I had proper sick time off or I would've quarantined myself.

 Why do FL, TX, CA have lower mortality rates than NY, NJ, MA did? That's my question. Feel free to hypothesize. My intitial thought was that some evidence showed that initial viral load may impact severity of illness. That matters, perhaps, because when the Northeast was getting hammered it was when almost nobody was trying to avoid it or even knew about it until everyone was sick. Even in more "mask-defiant" places like Florida or Texas, people are still, hypothetically, acting with more distance and caution than typical, therefore decreasing initial viral loads?

My other guess is vitamin D. Lots of data showing it matters. All three of the states I mentioned have more sunshine than the Northeast. 

Anyway. Food for thought and I am interested in what people think.

 It helps to be "someone" if you want a COVID19 test So the number of tests are limited and we are now being told that even if you develop symptoms you should not immediately get tested but rather isolate. We are supposed to be conserving tests and therefore the PPE thats being used when testing. The way I'm seeing things, people of higher "status" are being tested despite this. Ie: actors, althetes, politicians. Just saw Rand Paul has just now tested positive. Ok thats fine, but they also said he was just at the senate gym this morning. If he was well enough to go to the gym I'm assuming he had no symptoms, so why was he tested? Mike Pence and his wife were tested, despite no symptoms, because a whitehouse staffer tested positive. The thing is they admittedly had no contact with that staffer at all. I could go on with examples, but it just seems another example of how this whole situation is being botched.  Thoughts?
++++++++++
 Why isn't test capacity growing in the United States? This slide was shown at the White house briefing, showing how 'good' they are doing at testing. The graph shows total completed tests.. But it appears the number of tests performed per day is roughly the same as two weeks ago. i.e if you graphed tests performed on a given day instead of total tests performed to-date on a given day you'd get a flat graph. Are we still failing at growing test capacity?

 Did anyone else test positive for antibodies? Do you believe you had it  or are you assuming it’s a false positive. I’m in nyc and had minor symptoms in March, my doctor is almost certain it’s a true positive-I lost my taste and smell for weeks. 

I still am kind of in disbelief.
++++++++++
 The “Get Tested” Catch-22 You feel ill. You have cough and fever. You call your doctor to see if you should get tested. Usually you get a run around a few times, “You need to call so and so” then they tell you to call someone else.  Finally you call the right person. You tell them your symptoms then they ask “Have you travelled to a region with the infection or been exposed to someone who TESTED POSITIVE for the infection?”  Of course your answer is “No” so you don’t qualify for testing. 

Because they won’t test just for symptoms, no one comes in contact with anyone who has a positive test and no one gets tested and the circle jerk goes on and on, and there you have it. We have SO few cases that there’s nothing to worry about.

 A Microcosm of Stupidity: First Hand Account So I work at a gas station. About a week ago my assistant manager took 4 days off because of flu-like symptoms.  She was not tested for covid-19.  Two days after she returned to work she got a call from the clinic she went to when she first noticed symptoms, now the clinic WANTS to test her for covid-19 but since our state does not have enough tests to test her currently, she can't immediately get testing done.  She filled me in on all of this today as I was getting off my shift, standing less than a foot away from me.

Fine. Tell the store-manager and self-quarantine for 2 weeks or until tests become available.  That's the reasonable response right?  

Wrong.

Our store manager tells her, and this is an exact quote..."Thanks for coming into work and biting the bullet, we really needed your help around the store.  What could you do anyway? There aren't enough tests right now. (Laughs)"  

The assistant manager is 55+, her co-worker for the day is a lady that just got out of the hospital for serious surgery that is 60+, and the store manager who is 50+.  I'm at a loss for how stupid this is.

So the place I work at is now a prime vector for travelers and people buying drinks and snacks and then traveling all over the place.  

Thanks boss.

 How to handle the work situation? Someone tested positive at work (a construction site), someone tested positive at my gf's work (an office), one of our neighbors tested positive. We now have scratchy throats. I called in sick today but I dont know what to do beyond that. My company has said nothing other than if you're positive, stay home for 2 weeks. 

But the area I'm in has such limited testing that they're reserving it for only severe cases that require hospitalization. I'm fairly sure me and my gf both have it but there's no way to prove it yet.

 Foods to fight covid-19  

If you feed sick do the following:

Try and get tested, and follow all directions of medical personnel.

If they won't test or have no medicine then you will need to understand the theory of the covid-19.

The best known treatment is hydrocloroquine which acts in two ways, first as a zinc ionophore to let zinc which is a proven anti-viral into the cells and second to reduce inflammation and manage immune response. If the first way is the primary active ingredient then there may be some foods that can help fight covid-19

1. Green Tea or if you have it dietary supplement ecgc which is a concentration of one component from green tea. Take the recommended dose. This is a zinc ionophore like hydrocloroquinine so do not exceed the normal high dose limit on the suplement. If you don't have greed tea you can substitute:

Tea: green, white, oolong, and black teas.

Fruits: cranberries, strawberries, blackberries, kiwis, cherries, pears, peaches, apples, and avocados

Nuts: pecans, pistachios, and hazelnuts

2) Take quercetin at the recommended dose, quercetin is a concentrated flavonoid which is again a concentrated food product. This is also a zinc ionophore like hydrocloroquine. If you don't have any quercetin you can substitute:

leafy vegetables,

broccoli,

red onions,

peppers,

apples,

grapes,

black tea,

green tea,

red wine

some fruit juices

3) Take some dietary zinc 30-50 mg. You naturally have zinc in your blood and pee out excess so you can't raise your blood level much and for normal healthy diets dietary zinc isn't needed, but lets be on the safe side. Some people have reactions above 50 mg zinc. If you don't have zinc the following foods are high in zinc:

Shellfish: oysters, crab, lobster

Beef

Poultry

Pork

[Legumes](

[Nuts]( seeds

[Whole grains](

Fortified breakfast cereals

4) Take vitamin D. This produces a 10% immune benefit. Foods high in vitamin D if you can't get a multi vitamin with D:

Foods that provide [vitamin D]( include:

Fatty fish, like tuna, mackerel, and salmon

Foods fortified with vitamin D, like some dairy products, orange juice, soy milk, and cereals

Beef [liver](

Cheese

Egg yolks

Sunlight outside (not through window)

5) Take 1000 mg vitamin C. Vitamin C is good for the immune system but the purpose of this is to keep the ecgc and quercetin from oxidizing and prolong the zinc oxidization effect. If you don't have vitamine C use:

* Broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower.
* Green and red peppers.
* Spinach, cabbage, turnip greens, and other leafy greens.
* Sweet and white potatoes.
* Tomatoes and tomato juice.
* Winter squash.
* Cantaloupe.
* Citrus **fruits** and juices, such as orange and grapefruit.
* Kiwi **fruit**.
* Mango.
* Papaya.
* Pineapple.
* Strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, and cranberries.
* Watermelon.

 My boyfriend and I both woke up today feeling sick, now he tested positive for covid a few hours ago. What now? We both woke up today with weird symptoms, his being a lot worse than mine. He has a headache, slight sore throat, sensitivity to light, weakness, dizziness, fatigue, and low grade fever. All I have is a slight sore throat and a small tickle that occasionally makes me want to cough. He wanted to get tested just in case and it came back positive so we are just assuming I am positive as well since I’m with him every day and we are quarantining together. 

We have let family and friends know and have begun quarantine. What can we do to treat any symptoms? What can we take to help our bodies fight it? If you’ve beaten covid, how did you fight it?

 Management withholding positive test result info Before I say anything I just want to make it clear this post is not about knowing WHO the people were that had tested positive. 
I work at a restaurant, I was unaware until yesterday, the 23rd, that two of my coworkers had tested positive for the coronavirus, one on the 12th &amp; the other the 15th. My management, all the way up to our regional manager, were made aware of these positive results immediately, as per the employees own accounts of what occurred. There was no cleaning done, people who had associated closely with those who had tested positive requested time off from management to get tested, &amp; management denied this right. Along with that, it was a whole 7 days before anyone from management reached out to us to inform us of these cases. At this point, most people already knew but not everyone!!! And we should not be finding out this info thru coworkers, which most of us had to! It lead us to chaos &amp; misinformation. 
We have worked a lot of long hard hours thru this pandemic for this company. We are, above all, hurt that this is how they treated us &amp; our safety after all this dedication. 
With all this being said, several of us were wondering if pursuing legal action (filing a lawsuit) or filing complaints would be a possibility. With everything surrounding the coronavirus ever changing &amp; evolving, we are just not sure where to go from here. Any help or advice would be appreciated. Thank you.

 If only the sickest people are being tested, that too after they test negative for Flu and a myriad of other stuff. If we are actually doing that, why is the positive % around 10%? What do the other people have? Aren't the remaining susceptible to getting the virus in the future? Please excuse my very limited knowledge of epidemics or infectious diseases in general. I am looking for some scientific answers to my questions below - 

1) If we have so many hoops for testing and most of these people who get tested for covid have already been tested negative for the Flu and other stuff, why is the positive % so less? What exactly do these people have?

2) Let's assume they have just the common cold, doesn't this mean that they can get coronavirus in the future? So even if we test 100% of the population once (and have a 10% positive rate) the remaining 90% have the chances of getting it if the 10% are not strictly quarantined?

These might seem like noob questions, but I just need to understand what exactly is happening?

 I think my Dr. lied about testing be for COVID-19 Does anyone know if the same sample from a flu test can also be used for the COVID-19 test? For the flu test, I was swabbed just inside my nose but I heard that the COVID test is much more painful. Anyone have any insight? When I called up to my city’s health department, they told me they had no record of any test  of mine being sent to them but to continue to wait. About 2 weeks later I get a call from the hospital that tested me that my test was negative when u was told the health department would call me.

I feel as though I have been lied to and everyone is calling me paranoid.

 Bergen County, NJ -- Is there a way to tell if I already had COVID-19 in mid-February? My 1.5-year-old daughter and I were very ill in mid-February (14/15th to the end of February). We thought it was bad colds, which were unlike anything I had ever seen or experienced before (it was the sickest I have ever been).

As I'm reading about the symptoms that people with COVID-19 are experiencing, our symptoms were very similar: her -- 104 temperature for 5 days, shortness of breath, severe cough (don't know about sore throat or body aches since she can't tell us); me -- low-grade fever for almost a week, severe cough, body aches, shortness of breath, fatigue, sore throat. We were both tested for flu, RSV and strep -- all of which are negative.  CityMD diagnosed me with bronchitis (I was sick for almost 3 weeks), and my daughter was put on a nebulizer 2-3x/day (steroid and albuterol) which she is still 1x/day on as a precaution for pneumonia. My husband had a sore throat, body aches, and cough for a few days but recovered relatively quickly.

My question - is it possible we had COVID-19, and if we did, is it possible to tell? I obviously don't want to take resources from others who need to be tested now, but just wondering if there was any way to confirm.

 Is it fair that NBA players get easy access to the Coronavirus test while the general public has to meet requirements to get the test? Argument can be made that NBA players are around a lot of people so it is good to know who has the virus to protect others and people known to have been close to people who test positive need to get the test(all Utah Jazz players got test after one player tested positive). True but doesnt this apply to everyone in general?

 It’s not widely known a rash IS a symptom of COVID19 Hello, I thought in the spirit of helping other stay informed, especially those with community outbreak, I would share what I know. 

I am family to one of the Utah couples who were quarantined in the diamond princess off the coast of Japan in Feb, John and Melanie Haering (you may have heard of them from the news). I’ve noticed a few posts from members in areas of known outbreak asking about a rash being a symptom of Covid19. I would like to confirm that while it hasn’t been as widely published, this is in fact a symptom.

John Haering got a rash while aboard the diamond princess near beginning of his flu-like symptoms. The rash was like red sores, no blistering and no pain as he didn’t notice until he looked in the mirror. It was accompanied with a high fever and some nausea, not appetite. Contrary to popular symptoms, John did not have a cough. He later tested positive for the coronavirus and was treated at a Japanese hospital. 

His wife Melanie was taken to the Travis AFB for her quarantine. She confirmed that the CDC there informed them that a rash is one of the symptoms to look for with COVID19 as they were monitoring themselves during their quarantine. 

I am not sure why the rash hasn’t been more widely included in articles released about symptoms to look for, but I would like everyone to be informed as to what they can look for if they are concerned they may have contracted the virus. 

As in John’s case, he did not have typical symptoms of a cough. He did have a rash and high fever and nausea. Pneumonia developed about a week later after the other symptoms had improved. Just because you don’t have a cough or have a less common symptom like a rash it doesn’t not mean you don’t have COVD19. Be informed so that you can get tested when appropriate so you don’t spread it, especially to those who are high risk. 

I hope this was helpful. 

Wishing you all the best.
