 Should everyone be wearing a face mask? At this point isn't it basically socially responsible for everyone to be wearing a face and nose covering of some kind when they are in a public place?

- If you can spread it and you don't know you have it you should have your mouth and nose covered.  

- If you want to lower your chance of contracting it in a public place you should have you mouth, nose, and eyes covered. 

- If you want to avoid touching your face you should have it covered.

So what do you guys think?

 Violent confrontations with people being asked to wear face masks    
In the last few weeks a spate of American stores have made headlines after putting up signs telling customers who wear masks they will be denied entry.   


On Thursday, [Vice reported on]( a Kentucky convenience store that [put up a sign ]( “NO Face Masks allowed in store. Lower your mask or go somewhere else. Stop listening to \[Kentucky governor Andy\] Beshear, he’s a dumbass.”   
People who trying to save life lose their life, because of a culture war. Please just get a mask to save life. If you dont know where to get one just go [here]( for God sake.

 PSA: How to make groceries safe for your family. 1. Choose items that are non-perishable and won't be needed soon. Quarantine these items for 1-2 weeks.
2. Sanitize the outside of all remaining packages that will not allow the sanitizer to Penetrate the packaging.  I use isopropyl alcohol because it evaporates quickly and leaves no residue.  
3. Treat everything else as contaminated. For example, when I want a banana I will peel it carefully and eat the banana without touching anything except the peel. Afterwards I discard the peel and wash my hands. For oranges, I wash them with soap and water. For meat, I cook it and wash my hands after touching the packaging.

 Mask wearing needs to be all or nothing, otherwise we are wasting them I see that a lot of people are starting to wear masks, but I can’t help but feel they are wasting them, hear me out:

Masks (non n95 as I see most people are wearing) are very effective for not spreading if you are a carrier (asymptomatic included) but they do not prevent you from getting exposed if someone infected coughs on/near you.

If everyone wears masks then we can stop the spread, but as most people cannot buy any due to supply issue this isn’t possible.

So now we have this situation where people wearing masks are still getting exposed to the virus due to infected people not having masks. 

At this point would it be more effective for people that currently have masks to hold off wearing it until the production catches up? Otherwise we will be stuck in this cycle where masks are getting disposed while productions are trying to catch up. 

At that point everyone can wear masks and we stop the spread way more effectively.

Obviously this is never going to happen but with the amount of people not wearing masks, your best bet is not going outside as your mask won’t save you at all.

 CA - From a Bay Area RN... Many hospitals, including mine, are actually starting to ask for cloth mask donation due to significant mask shortages. This is largely due to the CDC's recommendation to "use homemade masks (e.g., bandana, scarf) for care of patients with COVID-19" in the event of a no-masks-available situation. (I suspect it is also the cheapest among their other recommendations). I've found that studies aren't very encouraging. I find it hard to rest when not at work so, to feel productive, I made this post to share on social media. I hope that people at least find it helpful in terms of information, patterns, etc. Or maybe someone far more creative than me comes up with a brilliant idea.

SHORT:

Please make cloth masks for hospitals. Maybe it is helpful, maybe it’s not, but it’s what the CDC is encouraging as our “last resort option” and it may be all we have.

Pattern One (focus on medium and large sizes for adults): [

Pattern Two: [

Pattern Four (Use Mask 2): [

LONG:

Healthcare in the United States is critically short in Personal Protective Equipment, shortened to PPE because healthcare adores acronyms. Our most important piece of PPE are masks, which are also in the shortest of supplies. Ideally N95 masks which filter out droplet AND airborne particles when fitted properly on the facial hair free face, but also surgical masks which help filter out droplet particles only. The Center for Disease Control or CDC (another acronym for you!) originally recommended that all healthcare workers wear N95s or equivalent equipment when taking care of patients positive for or being ruled out for COVID-19. This recommendation was downgraded to surgical masks largely due to critical shortage of N95s in the United States. At the bottom this recommendation included the use of “bandannas or scarves” in the absence of any other masks. Unfortunately, it is very likely that hospital systems throughout the United States will have to listen to this recommendation. That is how low supplies are.

Honestly, according to my millennial-level proficiency in [Google]( research, not only do bandannas make us look like Wild West bank robbers but they also provide very little protection. As do scarves. Unfortunately, actual studies on cloth masks in general aren’t overly positive either.

At worst cloth masks may do more harm than good. One large study states: “Moisture retention, reuse of cloth masks and poor filtration may result in increased risk of infection” in comparison to surgical masks. Results show a staggering difference: "Penetration of cloth masks by \[infectious\] particles was almost 97% and medical masks 44%." The recommendation from this study is that cloth masks should not be used at all.

Reference: [

At best, cloth masks may offer some protection. The majority of other smaller studies state that cloth masks offer limited protection (a better than nothing approach) and should only be used in “last resort situations”

Hospital systems all across the country are coming very close to these “last resort” situations or are already there. It feels desperate. And desperate times apparently call for desperate DIY options. Our CDC is even recommending such options and I expect that more hospitals will be asking for donations.So this is why I’m making this guide because we – healthcare workers as well as those working at grocery stores, loading docks, in your local police depart, etc. - need all the creative, crafty assistance we can get.

DIY Hospital Face Mask

According to Cambridge University DIY Hospital Face Masks come down to two components: Filtration and breathability. In order of most effective to worse: Vacuum cleaner bags, dish towels/tea towels, pillow cases, and t-shirts are the best fabrics to use filtration. Most fabrics were harder to breath through than a surgical mask in varying percentages, and double layers made that worse. The conclusion was that pillow cases, especially antimicrobial ones; and 100% cotton t-shirts were the best materials to mae face masks out of due to an acceptable combination of filtration and breathability.

Reference: [

Another recommendation comes from Owensboro Health in Kentucky/Indiana , which states:

“1. Recommended fabric for the outer portion of the mask includes heaver, non-stretch fabric such as denim, duck cloth, canvas, twill, or other tight woven fabric.

2. Recommended fabric for the inner lining and filter pocket can be other cotton, cotton-blend non-stretch fabric. It can be thinner and softer, but again recommended minimal or non-stretch.3. Must be laundered in HOT water prior to sewing to prevent future shrinkage.”

As far as patterns go, my preference is for a more fitted and protective fit. These three sources appear to be the most easy to follow.

However, if your sewing skill (like mine) is limited, don’t hesitate to turn to the “tried and true” rectangular shape. I'm going to turn to Deaconess Hospital on this one.

I can’t even begin to express my thanks for any who go our of their way to create and donate these DIY Face Masks. I know this is asking a lot in terms of time, money, and materials.

Thank you in advance for all that you are giving your healthcare workers.

Sincerely,Your friendly neighborhood nurse.

P.S. My DIY dream is a moisture resistant cloth masks made from two layers that form a pocket where a vacuum cleaner bag piece could be inserted-and-removed for extra filtration. You deserve a DIY gold award if you make this happen.

 Even if a N-95 is not fitted and facial hair impacts the fit , wouldn’t you still get a better protection than wearing a cloth mask? One of the talking points about N-95 masks is that they need to be fitted and don’t work if you have facial hair. Is it really all or nothing ?

Why is this framed as an all or nothing issue ? Isn’t there some improved benefit for the general population to wear N-95 masks compared to regular cloth masks ? 


Maybe N-50 but still better than nothing.

 ~Just Some Lifestyle Tips ~  

&amp;#x200B;

I’m the type of guy that licks his dollar bills as I count them out for transactions. And I tug at the bills as I remove them from the stack. I’m going to stop doing that! **Start using credit card exclusively.**

When I fill-up my car with gas I first take some towels from the outside service rack. The place where you get the squeegee to clean your windows. I use those towels to interact with the pump computer and I **use those towels to grab the gas pump handle.** LPT - Grab some extra towels &amp; keep them in your car.

**Use those gas station towels when you open public doors** &amp; then discard them. 

Those paper towels also come in handy when in the grocery store. **Use a towel when you first grab a cart.** Most grocery stores now provide sanitary wipes that you then can use after you chose a cart.

When you’re going through apples and pears &amp; such, try not to touch too many of them. **Look for pre-packaged vegetables.**

**Stop going out to eat.** Except the drive-through fast food.

**Stop going to the bar.** Fuckin pig sty.

**QUIT THE GYM NOW.** If you have automatic withdrawal for your monthly gym membership, try to obtain the cancellation phone number yourself and the name of the company in case they mess with your account.

If you’re like me you are addicted to the sauna. Although the heat in the sauna kills most germs it's still good to take some precautions. Fill-up a used water bottle with tap water &amp; take that into the sauna. Spray the boards where you are going to sit in case some guy’s nutsack or asshole was directly on the wood. Use the same water in your bottle to spray on the hot rocks. **Don’t use the public  ladle!** I sauna about four times a week and the Asian dudes are ALWAYS forcing themselves to cough &amp; snort &amp; hack. Alway been kind-of gross. DON’T SIT DIRECTLY ACROSS from them. Sit next to them. Why take a chance.

**Stop going to church.** The entire Sunday service is like a recruiting video for the COVID-19. Worship through the TV or computer monitor.

When you sneeze or cough don’t bury your face into your elbow. Sneeze openly. **Let the spray out into the air.** By covering your cough or sneeze you are actually driving the germs/virus into your clothing. In that way you may re-infect yourself at a later date. Plus you are bringing spores home which may infect your loved ones.

I know these tips may not ever be necessary but just by practicing them you become more aware of yourself &amp; your interaction with the world.

Let’s all **STAY SAFE.**

 The perplexing non-mask wearers... I saw an interview with people in Italy who asked,  “Don’t the Americans care about their health?” The Italians  were referring  to Americans rebelling against wearing masks.  Personally , I do not LIKE wearing masks, but I wear them because science says they keep us safer/healthier.  So, I put on the mask faithfully, especially before I walk into a store.  Yet despite the signs plastered all over stores’ doors and walls, I’m still seeing people with their noses uncovered, with masks flapping under their chins, with masks that make no sense whatsoever (Halloween masks, face shields without masks underneath, and today—not sure what it was, a little tiny square of plastic   half the size of a credit card, suspended in front of someone’s mouth). Of course, the worst is people with no masks at all.  So I ask you—how do you feel about similar situations you’ve encountered, and what if anything do you do about  it?

 Do we need to wear masks inside an apartment building? I live in a New York City apartment building. The rule is that if you go outside then you need to wear a mask. But if I stay inside the building to collect my mail/packages or go to the basement to do laundry or take the trash to the garbage room, do I still need to wear a face mask?

I rarely bump into anyone. And if they are waiting for the elevator I would let them go first and I’ll take the next empty elevator. While waiting for the elevator, I would wait at a distance away from the other person.

What are your thoughts? Should I wear a mask?

 Can you chew gum so that you are "eating" and thus don't have to technically wear a mask since eating and drinking count as exceptions? What if you just chew gum or walk around with a CamelBak so that you're constantly eating or drinking, are masks enforceable there?

They are getting too Nazi about this at my gym. Clearly, the rules state if you're 6 feet away from others, the mask isn't required or if you're eating or drinking. Being told to wear a mask when you're running 10 mph on an incline seems more dangerous. It is easy to wear a mask if you don't break a sweat during your "workout."

 Wear a damn mask.      My dad always says that rules/laws are for the people who break them. 

     The director of the CDC claims we could have this virus under control in weeks in America if the people simply followed their guidelines. This means wearing a mask, but apparently for anti-maskers nothing that simple can be practiced.

     I’m tired of the “I’m in a free country so I’m not wearing a mask” BS. Yes, you are in a free country, and you do have the right to not wear one, however, be ready for the repercussions. Just like YES, you are in a free country, you can kill/shoplift/deal drugs if you so choose. But guess what, now you have to deal with the consequences of your actions. It’s how breaking the law in a free country works. 

     If a store has a policy where they require their staff and customers to wear masks, wear a damn mask. They have always had the right to have these policies in place refuse service to anyone no questions asked. They could require you to wear a hula skirt and a straw hat if they fucking wanted to and you would have to comply. 

     I am not a ‘sheep’ for wearing a mask. You think this virus is a hoax? Cool, your belief, but my belief is that it is very real so I’m wearing a mask, don’t preach to me and try to take it off my face. Some hoax really, considering the entire planet is in on this ‘prank’. 

     The reason this virus is still rampant in America is because of people like this. Americans are all about ME ME ME and do not give a fuck about anyone else, even in a PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. These people need to get their heads out of their own asses and realize that pandemics are a real thing. And that the consequences of their own actions are a real thing. 

   Wear a damn mask.

 Looking for a new protective mask - thoughts on the Honeywell Dual Layer Face Mask? Would this [Honeywell Dual Layer Face Mask]( be better than a standard mask? How does it compare to a N95?

Take steps to help protect yourself and others while remaining comfortable in the Honeywell Dual-Layer Face Cover with replaceable high-quality filters. When used together, the Honeywell Dual-Layer Face Cover and filters block penetration and provide enhanced filtration of aerosol droplets more effectively than common cloth face coverings.

The Honeywell Dual-Layer Face Cover is an innovative fabric face covering design with enhanced functionality. Not all face coverings provide the same level of filtration. 

Filtration Efficiency is the ratio of the amount of bacterial aerosols challenging a mask versus the amount able to penetrate the mask. Bacterial Filtration Efficiency (BFE) and Particulate Filtration Efficiency (PFE) ratios evaluate the ability of a face covering to keep aerosol droplets – caused by others’ talking, coughing, and sneezing – away from the wearer’s mouth and nose, as well as the ability to prevent aerosols from the wearer’s mouth from reaching the environment. Appropriately fitted, the Honeywell Dual Layer Face Cover together with this filter block ≥98% of 0.3-micron-sized particles (BFE) and 0.1-micron-sized particles (PFE).

 Open Letter to Governor Doug Ducey (R-Arizona) - Please share/send/distribute - Sent 6/15/2020 Governor Ducey,

I find it unacceptable that your answer is that business must continue and that we need to learn to live alongside Covid.  

I find it unacceptable that you are not mandating masks.  I find it unacceptable that you're not even supporting masks.

We need to ***require*** masks in all public areas.  We need to pump the brakes on any further reopening until you have met CDC reopening requirements, which, incidentally, we HAVE NOT.  The last thing we need is our fellow Arizonans out and about, breathing in each others' air-conditioned recirculated air, not wearing masks.  Asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic spread of this virus has been shown as a source of community transmission.  This is true whether you find it politically convenient or not.

Masks should be worn by all first responders, all medical staff, and all government employees, including you.  You should be leading by example.  I want you to use your platform to normalize the wearing of masks in public and mandate it.  You should do everything in your limited power to limit spread and save lives.  We need to be wearing masks.  The data is clear.  I demand that this policy be enacted.  I don't care if it's politically undesirable to the GOP base.  It's necessary.  

We are not allowed to smoke in public spaces or airplanes.  We are not allowed to drink and drive.  We're not allowed to enter businesses without shirts or shoes.  

We must 100% commit to wearing masks in public spaces.  Sometimes, personal freedoms must be temporarily or permanently compromised for the collective health of a society.  This is necessary.

You will eventually reach this conclusion when thousands of lives have been lost.  It will be too late.  It is already too late.

Do the right thing.

 Copied message from a doctor with tips on getting through Corona virus This is good.. read it.. may keep you from getting Coronavirus
Sent: Saturday, February 29, 2020, 12:46:40 PM CST
Subject: Coronavirus
 
 
 
 
Dear Colleagues,
 
As some of you may recall, when I was a professor of pathology at the University of California San Diego, I was one of the first molecular virologists in the world to work on coronaviruses (the 1970s). I was the first to demonstrate the number of genes the virus contained. Since then, I have kept up with the coronavirus field and its multiple clinical transfers into the human population (e.g., SARS, MERS), from different animal sources.
 
The current projections for its expansion in the US are only probable, due to continued insufficient worldwide data, but it is most likely to be widespread in the US by mid to late March and April.
 
Here is what I have done and the precautions that I take and will take. These are the same precautions I currently use during our influenza seasons, except for the mask and gloves.:
 
1) NO HANDSHAKING! Use a fist bump, slight bow, elbow bump, etc.
 
2) Use ONLY your knuckle to touch light switches. elevator buttons, etc.. Lift the gasoline dispenser with a paper towel or use a disposable glove.
 
3) Open doors with your closed fist or hip - do not grasp the handle with your hand, unless there is no other way to open the door. Especially important on bathroom and post office/commercial doors.
 
4) Use disinfectant wipes at the stores when they are available, including wiping the handle and child seat in grocery carts.
 
5) Wash your hands with soap for 10-20 seconds and/or use a greater than 60% alcohol-based hand sanitizer whenever you return home from ANY activity that involves locations where other people have been.
 
6) Keep a bottle of sanitizer available at each of your home's entrances. AND in your car for use after getting gas or touching other contaminated objects when you can't immediately wash your hands.
 
7) If possible, cough or sneeze into a disposable tissue and discard. Use your elbow only if you have to. The clothing on your elbow will contain infectious virus that can be passed on for up to a week or more!
 
What I have stocked in preparation for the pandemic spread to the US:
 
1) Latex or nitrile latex disposable gloves for use when going shopping, using the gasoline pump, and all other outside activity when you come in contact with contaminated areas. Note: This virus is spread in large droplets by coughing and sneezing. This means that the air will not infect you! BUT all the surfaces where these droplets land on are infectious for about a week on average - everything that is associated with infected people will be contaminated and potentially infectious. The virus is on surfaces and you will not be infected unless your unprotected face is directly coughed or sneezed upon. This virus only has cell receptors for lung cells (it only infects your lungs) The only way for the virus to infect you is through your nose or mouth via your hands or an infected cough or sneeze onto or into your nose or mouth.
 
2) Stock up now with disposable surgical masks and use them to prevent you from touching your nose and/or mouth (We touch our nose/mouth 90X/day without knowing it!). This is the only way this virus can infect you - it is lung-specific. The mask will not prevent the virus in a direct sneeze from getting into your nose or mouth - it is only to keep you from touching your nose or mouth.
 
3) Stock up now with hand sanitizers and latex/nitrile gloves (get the appropriate sizes for your family). The hand sanitizers must be alcohol-based and greater than 60% alcohol to be effective.
 
4) Stock up now with zinc lozenges. These lozenges have been proven to be effective in blocking coronavirus (and most other viruses) from multiplying in your throat and nasopharynx. Use as directed several times each day when you begin to feel ANY "cold-like" symptoms beginning. It is best to lie down and let the lozenge dissolve in the back of your throat and nasopharynx. Cold-Eeze lozenges is one brand available, but there are other brands available.
 
I, as many others do, hope that this pandemic will be reasonably contained, BUT I personally do not think it will be. Humans have never seen this snake-associated virus before and have no internal defense against it. Tremendous worldwide efforts are being made to understand the molecular and clinical virology of this virus. Unbelievable molecular knowledge about the genomics, structure, and virulence of this virus has already been achieved. BUT, there will be NO drugs or vaccines available this year to protect us or limit the infection within us. Only symptomatic support is available.
 
I hope these personal thoughts will be helpful during this potentially catastrophic pandemic. You are welcome to share this email. Good luck to all of us! Jim

 Not all masks help If you want to prevent yourself from getting the coronavirus a standard doctor mask will not help. The best type of masks to wear are 3m masks or highly filtered masks. Viruses are very tiny and could easily go through fabric. Also if you are wearing a mask that has less filtering try to change it more often.

 DIY masks for healthcare providers? I am trying to invent something for healthcare providers that could be used as a mask like an n95 because we have 4 left where I work and soon 0. While I'm not high risk because I'm in mental health, both my grandmother and mom were nurses and I have served as an EMT and know that first responders in my area and hospital staff deserve better than to be asked to reuse or go without PPE. I have tons of elastic and protective flannel (flannel with a vinyl layer in the middle) and my husband has 3d printed me a piece that can be sewn in easily for mass production and that will hold a thin filter material like vacuum cleaner bags and filter paper. I have a sewing machine and have a design very similar to a 3m dust mask or n95 disposable mask made with elastic around the chin and aluminum nose bridge to keep a good fit. It seems to pass a basic cup your hands and exhale strongly fit test. 

I found this study ( [  and this one  [ ) that seemed promising for the vacuum bags but also have some filter paper and was wondering if it is similar enough to be effective as well?

 Fighting virus: now come to important minutiae or detail part, use air filtering thing (mask) 1. Need educate people: in a virus severe city/place, the air is contaminated and dirty (because of virus and virus poisonings). Especially in an enclosed area: such as MacDonald, department store, Starbucks and office tower etc.. Even for an open area, if it’s crowded – the air is also contaminated, dirty and full of virus.
 So need use an air filtering thing (mask) to filtrate and purify air; and when you wear it, it’s not letting you breath less air, but actually help you absorb/take in more clean/purified air.  
Masks company and government office will need vigorously promote and advertise people to use this medical article (i.e. wearing masks).
..After you finish wearing masks, be careful and don’t touch outside part of mask before you sterilize it or simply dispose it; it’s full of virus and virus poisonings..
2. So can enforce it as a rule/requirement/policy for businesses:  (as they did in South Korea or other Country), people are allowed to enter or buy stuff from their businesses only when they wear masks; otherwise, you couldn’t buy coffee/hamburger/juice drinks, or clothes/cups etc in their shops/stores unless you wear mask. (For food, it’s better to order carry-out; if they decide sit to eat, will need keep 2 meter distance from each other).

3. This rule can also be enforced in working place: People who are willing to wear masks are allowed to go back to work and earn money – need sign an agreement to wear mask in order to work; and will be asked to leave the working place if one is not wearing a mask. 
4. In addition, people are encouraged to cover their hand with gloves or paper/tissue/napkin when touch or hold a door handles of a public place so that virus won’t contaminate their hands.
5. With wearing masks and covering hand, it can notably reduce virus contagious ratio, to much less than 1.

 It's interesting that IW and others of "the gang" are silent about masks My theory is that #masks4all has disrupted the way it supposed to go - ?escalating tensions with China?. And now IW and other of the controlled opposition team are silent and waiting what to do. I have seen only one demonizing article about masks about some town in Texas    giving people $1000 fine for not wearing a mask when in public. I don't  know if it's even true , the point is the narrative and absolute silence  about masks.

No   other article  about masks at all, they are more silent on masks than   the WHO. It's  kinda funny to see that as a random Slovak how a common   sense of a few  people on the Internet fucked up the whole plan and the   deaths will  be maybe less than 100,000 when people will wear masks en   masse in the  next few weeks.

Another   reason  why they don't want to promote masks. It's worse for face   recognition.  This should ring your bells guys, if you still think that   IW and Alex  are not controlled opposition that have to sheppard the   "rebel and  freedom loving sheep".

 Can you help me poke holes at this mask design? HACK THE PANDEMIC 
Necessity is the mother of all invention.

Design forward:
I initially thought a good 3D printed mask was the answer but I needed something I could iterate quick,design easily and yet still provide a good amount of protection. So I spent the last week of isolation figuring out this design -- I think this design is pretty good but I'd be happy for people to poke holes at it.  I broke apart the parts of an N95 and it's basically a layer of 4-5 plastic propylene sheets.  Some masks also have filter layers, carbon filters and respirators.   My design is totally basic and it's made of everyday stuff to mimic the design.  This isn't 100% failsafe obviously but like my sister who is an ICU doctor says ---Any mask is better than no mask. Just doing my part. 

Design notes:
This is a disposable mask.  The design of this mask is made of layers of cardstock, plastic and fabric/filter. It can be constructed with gluestick/ glue,or tape if you're in a bind. Covid sticks to cardboard for up to 24 hours so I suggest putting it under the sun for 24 hours after construction. If you want to be sure, construct in a clean area, wear gloves and a mask. 

To construct:
1-print pattern 
2-use pattern to cut shape on cardstock
3-use pattern to cut shape on plastic (this step is added as another barrier. It's not really necessary but I like to be as thorough as I can and want to give that option)
4-use pattern to cut shape on fabric. You can also just cut fabric to 9"x4" shapes because you can always just place it inside the mask.  I think you can even use tissue/paper towel becuase the fabric is not just for added layer of protection/comfort, but it's also just a moisture barrier
5-Glue/tape plastic to cardstock front
6-Add earloop slits
6-Shape and glue/tape together
7- At this point you can either set out your mask under sun for 24 hours if you wish. Store in a DRY space or ziplocked
8- For earloops, I used a jersey tshirt I cut to 1/4" x 8" strips. Make sure your elastic/ earloops and fabric are cleaned prior to next step.
9- When ready to use, attach earloops the way I have it in the picture. Lay fabric over the mask. You can attach fabric with tape if you want but adding 2 pcs underneath the cardboard construction seems to hold up fine as well.  This is the fastest way I've also figured out how to make it and it seems to hold up well enough.
10- When you wear the mask, shape it around the contours of your face and cheeks.  Pull elastic to fit

I'm still testing the fit and size again but this design iteration seems to hold up well.  It won't filter out 95% of air particles but it will at least protect from direct splatter. It also uses everyday materials so hopefully people who are hoarding masks or are in fear of not having any masks or can't sew ,can make their own with. 

Also if you are hoarding, please give those masks to the hospital medical staff. They need it more than you. You're in isolation, they're exposed to it everyday and yes, they will run out of their supplies and no they can't order it fast enough.  

I don't know if hospitals or any other agencies would consider this design but I thought I would help by putting on my innovation hat.  Please try it out if you can. I thought I'd put it out there for the community at large to help poke holes at it (no pun intended).  I'm also working on making kids mask and also breaking apart plastic acetate frames to construct face shields (I'll post updates on how to construct when I'm done making one).  I'll also try constructing laminated paper and sturdier masks for anyone in the medical field or people in the front lines if this design is satisfactory.  

Please feel free to copy or share or break apart my design and reconstruct something faster and resilient

 Make Masks a Fashion Accessory!!! Let’s treat face masks like accessories that people collect and wear! Let’s treat them like those pop culture t-shirts you see in the mall and buy because they’re funny and bring you joy. Let’s color-coordinate them with  our outfits, and have different masks for different occasions. Holiday masks! Business masks! Sundress masks! Lazy slob masks! Sexy date night masks!
Let’s normalize mask accessorizing to the point where people have to follow the trend, purely because that’s what fashion dictates. Make masks the new skinny jeans!

 Magic Mikes and Podium Pandemonium I see it again and again...

Government and scientific experts approach the podium to tell us how to behave to defeat the virus. Then, one by one, they take their stand, strip off their masks, and make their speeches. 

Up comes the next speaker. Lather. Rinse. Repeat.

Don't they know that speaking aloud releases aerosols, that the virus is spread via aerosols, and that masks are one of the best defenses we have – *when masks are worn*? Yet they take off their masks in order to speak.

They must believe that the microphone at the podium magically kills the virus!

 The best way to resist CoronaVirus. Hi,   
My name is James. And I wanna show guys some tips about how China can successfully bait this virus.  
When the Coronavirus outbreak, the Chinese government realized that we need to control virus diffusion.  
So, each area positive response to the Chinese government.  
Tips 1: You just stay at home, never go out.   
Tips 2: When you get a fever you should take care of yourself if you got sick in 3 days, the best way for   
you are going to the hospital as soon as possible.  
Tips 3: You should go to the supermarket to buy some Necessities of life at least for a week.  


Tips 4:  Do not litter or spit everywhere. Disposable masks must be destroyed after use.   


Tips 5: Do not have close contact with respiratory patients.  


Tips 6: If you need to go out do not forget to take an N95 Mask or surgical mask.  


Masks are the most important protective measures. I have an Amazon stock of 300,000 surgical masks.

 Social Stigma of Mask Perhaps the reason why the US government is telling healthy people not to wear mask is to avoid panic. If people see others wearing mask and find out they can’t buy it anymore, the level of panic will increase. Mass panic could prove to be much worse than the disease itself. Wearing mask does not always mean you are sick or a signal for other people to stay 10 feet away from you. On the other side of the globe, healthy people are wearing mask daily when they go out. Perhaps it’s time for the Western culture to drop the dumb stigma of wearing a mask.

Still, is spreading misinformation really the way? Why are civilians being shamed for buying mask? We have the right to protect ourselves. Why do they have to say mask is useless for healthy people? It is a dangerous statement coming out from the government. In China, anyone who does not wear a mask will be arrested. Mask does work, different types of mask means different level of protection. What if the person is asymptomatic aka he/she is a carrier but has not develop symptoms yet? Can we really trust sick people to wear mask? They don’t even know how to cover their cough/sneeze properly. They are also probably afraid of being called weird for wearing a mask.

Ask yourself, why do you wear a seatbelt? Because you never know what’s going to happen, you may be able to trust yourself but you are not the only person. There are others out there, others with lack of responsibility and care for other people.

They are saying that there is not enough mask for the front liner workers, so civilians should not be hoarding it. Well, it’s not like they had almost 2 months to prepare.. Oh wait, they did. For whatever reasons of why they were not being proactive, please don’t blame the civilians for the government’s lack of preparation.

It’s easy to point fingers at other people/country. US is by no means the worst, but yet they are far from the best.There are so many questionable things that the US government does regarding the disease. From the lack of airport closures, lack of airport security health check, faulty test kits, extremely strict rules in order to qualify for testing, patients literally turned away from testing, doctors and hospitals prohibited to do testings, etc.

A wise person once said, “If you are confused of why certain actions are being made, find the answer by following where the $ is.”

Damn right.

Argument:

[Even if there are cases next door, the answer is no, you do NOT need to get or wear any face masks—surgical masks, “N95 masks,” respirator masks, or anything else—to protect yourself against the coronavirus. Not only do you not need them, you shouldn’t wear them](

 Tips for wearing something over your mouth and nose when in public and around people. There's a lot of debate on right now about whether the general public should be wearing masks when out in public and around other people. One main concern against is that there are not enough masks and the masks that are available should go to healthcare workers to get the best utility out of them. I completely believe this but that does not mean that the general public shouldn't find other means to cover their nose and mouth in public. If you can't make your own fancy mask, cut up a t-shirt so that you can tie it around your face (two layers is better than one). Cut some upper and lower ties. If enough people do this, others will think "Hey, I can do that too."

Another concern about the general public wearing masks is that there is potential for mishandling leading to self inoculation. Here are some tips for wearing a mask:
* Continue to follow other CDC guidelines (social distancing, hand washing, etc). Wearing a mask does not give you cart blanche to get into a crowd and party.
* Wash your hands before and after putting the mask on. The best is to put it on at home and leave it on until you get back home. Don't put it on the car or anywhere else when your hands might already be contaminated.
* DO NOT TOUCH THE MASK while you are wearing it. If you need to cough or sneeze, just do it right into the mask (into your arm). Don't remove the mask to use tissue paper. If you need to take it off, have a plastic bag to put it in, put it into your pocket to take home. Wash your hands. If you are coughing a lot, stay home.
* Wash your mask after each use. Consider it contaminated after each use. Only put on clean masks. 
* If you are still going to work, this gets hard since you'll need to eat and drink. I don't know of a good solution other than make yourself several masks for the day. Don't lift up your mask to eat or drink. Don't wear it around your neck. Best to just take it off and put it in a bag to take home to wash.

Here are the potential benefits for those not keeping up with the discussions:
* It decreases the chance of you accidentally touching your nose and mouth when your hands might be contaminated. The mask is a conscious reminder for you not to touch your face.
* If you are an asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic carrier, it can help mitigate spread when you cough, sneeze or talk.
* It acts as a barrier if you happen to be around someone who coughs, sneezes or talks. It may not prevent you from getting infected, but it can decrease the risk.

Thoughts on this?

 Advice for using face masks? Hey there! 👋 I'm thinking of buying a N95 face mask to stay protected when I go outside to do my grocery shopping. I don't want to take any risk since there are a lot of people still going to my local supermarket and I find the cleaning policy really doubtful.

I found what seems to be a [good face mask model]( on a website, but before buying it, does someone have any advice on how to properly use it (changing filters, see if they fit, etc.)?

 Effective My doctor literally said a carbon activated mask, which is “much thicker” than a surgical mask, tends to be the most effective in this case. Which is exactly why I’m loading up on the masks from armormasks.com to be responsive. Viruses are the size of a micro dot on the cell membrane. A mask that will ACTUALLY capture nano organisms from entering in order to stay safe is effective. NOT TAKING A CHANCE.

 Reusing Face Masks? So obviously because of the virus we’ve all had to get pretty used to wearing face masks when we leave the house. Should we theoretically be washing/disposing of face masks after EVERY use, and if so why? 

I don’t touch my eyes nose or mouth when I put on or take off my mask, and especially make sure to not touch the inside of the mask no matter what. When I’m done with the mask I make sure the outside does not touch any other objects, and always wash my hands right after just to be safe. 

Not sure how the science works but thoughts would be great! Thanks.

 PM 2.5/Carbon Filter Masks Effectiveness Against Virus? Apologies if this isn’t allowed, Ive searched online but haven’t found anything concise and figured someone would know here. 

Basically, I see these face fitting cloth/seemingly heavy duty masks with carbon filters in them, I believe they’re called PM 2.5. I’m aware the general rule for masks right now is most masks will offer at least some protection to others from you, but only a proper fitting n95 will protect you from others. 

What would the case be for these masks? I ask because the masks are definitely appearing to offer a full seal which seems to a the point of n95 masks, but I’m not sure if the filters and this PM 2.5 mask would protect from how small the virus itself is and would still get through for the wearer from others.

 Partner’s manager violating social distancing orders at essential business (laundromat)- need help on how to proceed Hey, all. I couldn’t quite decide where to post this, but I figured that this might be a good place to start. 

I live in Sacramento- my partner works at a laundromat, and their manager (the owner) began the quarantine with stringent policies to protect the staff. However, when he saw the numbers beginning to go down, all bets were off. 

While the order remains posted on the door, in a space that isn’t even **wide** enough to honor social distancing, my partner is watching seven customers doing their laundry. No masks, no consideration given to any manner of distancing, and the owner has failed to provide the staff with materials to adequately disinfect the space. 

I want to report the business desperately, but I’m worried that if I do, my partner will be fined for the order being violated on their watch (under the extreme pressure of the business owner). Is there any precedent here that anyone is aware of?

 I know 2 people who have gotten bacterial infections from wearing masks without proper hygiene practices. I wanted to make this discussion post because I now know a 2nd person who is in the hospital due to a bacterial lung infection that their doctor has stated is from wearing a mask with poor hygiene practices.

In my opinion, I think that if governments are to require masks for 'health safety' then they should also be required to post regulations for safe ways to wear a mask. And I'm talking about safety beyond covid19, because there is so much more out there than covid that I think so many people are forgetting about. I've worked with so many people who wear the same masks daily without washing or even taken them home. I went out to eat with one coworker who I always noticed wearing the same mask and they took it off to eat, and it was *brown* on the inside! Yuck!! Not to mention I used to work in fast food where people would hand their masks next to our fryers at the end of their shifts.. like please just take them home and wash them!

I also have multiple people in my family who work in hospitals who all have said that even prior to the pandemic they were required to change their masks after 7-8 hours, or in between breaks if they got them. And if they ate during breaks they were usually recommend to brush their teeth before putting a mask on to reduce chances of getting an infection. I just find it so strange how the public, who is required to wear masks for health safety, are also not required to know the health risk of wearing masks without good practice..

Just my two cents I guess. The first person I know who got an infection has since recovered, but the one that recently was diagnosed is currently on a ventilator. So yeah, wash your damn masks. And if you work in any part of government or management maybe consider ways to notify your citizens/employees of good hygiene practices with masks.

 Samples/Buffets. 
Every stand for hand sanitizer is completely empty and every place and every place within 20+ minuets (however there is still soap on the shelves. Go figure.) 

I work at a cake shop that gives free samples of cake- it’s a help your self kind of a deal, with tongs and napkins. (I wouldn’t personally grab a sample most places that’s not being handed to me directly and especially not with everything that’s happening now.) 

Most people ignore the tongs and grab with their hands, even within this last week I’ve witnessed it EVERY SINGLE DAY almost 7/10 people helping themselves. They then proceed to lick the frosting off their fingers, touch their card, money, door handles, etc, and go about their day. 

HOW IS EVERY SINGLE PLACE SOLD OUT OF PURELL YET THESE IDIOTS ARE LICKING THEIR HANDS AND TOUCHING EVERYTHING, thank god they bought the hand sanitizer though as they stick their dirty un sanitized hands in their mouths. 


I don’t understand. 

Please. For the love of god. Wash your hands. Don’t lick your hands. And whatever you do please don’t go to buffets or eat samples. 

People are disgusting and this is never going to end, but at least everyone’s hoarding the purell they certainly do not use as they touch door handles and every other thing they come into contact with, and then proceed to lick their hands. 

Haven’t seen ONE of them even use hand sanitizer and there’s no customer restrooms so nobodies washing their hands.

 why not wearing masks?   

I don’t really know why not wearing a mask in US?

Reason 1: experts say “if you’re healthy, you don’t need to wear a mask”

But in Taiwan, they contain virus pretty well. 

The only difference between US and Taiwan is wearing masks.

You maybe say Taiwan is island so it’s easy to isolate virus from the outside of their border.

But US is also a BIG ISLAND from china.

You maybe say Taiwan's medical environment is good enough to take care of and manage patients,

But Europe’s is also good enough at the early stage. 

 

Reason 2: shortage of masks

but there are other substitute materials to make homemade masks.

 Wear masks or cover your mouth at least. I have noticed something here.
All the countries abundant with masks are suggesting to wear masks.
Italians are starting to wear masks. If you watch recent videos, important people in Italy are wearing masks.

Doctors and nurses must wear masks to protect themselves.
For us, in America, we dont have enough masks, not even for medical professionals.

If we had more masks, the government would have suggested to wear masks!

Check our your local markets. Dont trust them saying that wearing mask doesnt do anything. It is better than nothing.

Wearing a mask is not a cultural thing.
We are just told not to wear them because we dont have enough. 

So, my suggest is just use anything that could be used as a mask.

 Mask filters and valves... I’ve been reading a lot of articles and seeing pictures that are advising against wearing a mask with a valve. Not trying to be a Karen but sometimes when at work after a lot of running around and lifting (I work at a restaurant as a food runner) when ever it starts to get really busy it becomes pretty hard for me to start breathing, so I have to go sit in the back and take off my mask for a while. I want to install a valve in mine or buy one with a valve but of course I want to do my part to limit the virus spread. If I also added a filter to my mask with a filtered valve would that be a little better than wearing a mask with a valve but without filtered layers?

 Am I sick? Not sure if this is the right sub to ask but just thought id try. So, I went out today and wore a face mask and gloves too. First time ive been out in a week.

 Not sure if its because of the face mask, but i have a runny nose and my back and neck is aching. I was sneezing quite a good amount for 2 hrs an hr ago. 

I also had pulled an allnighter and slept 5 hrs in the afternoon. Not sure if these are just symptoms from that or if my poor sleep today just weaked my immune system causing me to catch covid. I normally sleep 8-9hrs a night. Im 22 and have a fairly healthy diet. 

Should i just call my doctor and check or should i self isolate and wait it out, or was it just having to breathe through the mask that was the problem?

 Good tips for prevention from an expert This was shared with me. Feel free to share 

The author is James Robb, MD UC San Diego. 

 

Subject: What I am doing for the upcoming COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic

 

Dear Colleagues, as some of you may recall, when I was a professor of pathology at the University of California San Diego, I was one of the first molecular virologists in the world to work on coronaviruses (the 1970s). I was the first to demonstrate the number of genes the virus contained. Since then, I have kept up with the coronavirus field and its multiple clinical transfers into the human population (e.g., SARS, MERS), from different animal sources. 

 

The current projections for its expansion in the US are only probable, due to continued insufficient worldwide data, but it is most likely to be widespread in the US by mid to late March and April. 

 

Here is what I have done and the precautions that I take and will take. These are the same precautions I currently use during our influenza seasons, except for the mask and gloves.:

 

1) NO HANDSHAKING! Use a fist bump, slight bow, elbow bump, etc.

 

2) Use ONLY your knuckle to touch light switches. elevator buttons, etc.. Lift the gasoline dispenser with a paper towel or use a disposable glove. 

 

3) Open doors with your closed fist or hip - do not grasp the handle with your hand, unless there is no other way to open the door. Especially important on bathroom and post office/commercial doors.

 

4) Use disinfectant wipes at the stores when they are available, including wiping the handle and child seat in grocery carts. 

 

5) Wash your hands with soap for 10-20 seconds and/or use a greater than 60% alcohol-based hand sanitizer whenever you return home from ANY activity that involves locations where other people have been. 

 

6) Keep a bottle of sanitizer available at each of your home's entrances. AND in your car for use after getting gas or touching other contaminated objects when you can't immediately wash your hands.

 

7) If possible, cough or sneeze into a disposable tissue and discard. Use your elbow only if you have to. The clothing on your elbow will contain infectious virus that can be passed on for up to a week or more!

 

What I have stocked in preparation for the pandemic spread to the US:

 

1) Latex or nitrile latex disposable gloves for use when going shopping, using the gasoline pump, and all other outside activity when you come in contact with contaminated areas.

 

       Note: This virus is spread in large droplets by coughing and sneezing. This means that the air will not infect you! BUT all the surfaces where these droplets land are infectious for about a week on average - everything that is associated with infected people will be contaminated and potentially infectious. The virus is on surfaces and you will not be infected unless your unprotected face is directly coughed or sneezed upon. This virus only has cell receptors for lung cells (it only infects your lungs) The only way for the virus to infect you is through your nose or mouth via your hands or an infected cough or sneeze onto or into your nose or mouth. 

 

2) Stock up now with disposable surgical masks and use them to prevent you from touching your nose and/or mouth (We touch our nose/mouth 90X/day without knowing it!). This is the only way this virus can infect you - it is lung-specific. The mask will not prevent the virus in a direct sneeze from getting into your nose or mouth - it is only to keep you from touching your nose or mouth.

 

3) Stock up now with hand sanitizers and latex/nitrile gloves (get the appropriate sizes for your family). The hand sanitizers must be alcohol-based and greater than 60% alcohol to be effective.

 

4) Stock up now with zinc lozenges. These lozenges have been proven to be effective in blocking coronavirus (and most other viruses) from multiplying in your throat and nasopharynx. Use as directed several times each day when you begin to feel ANY "cold-like" symptoms beginning. It is best to lie down and let the lozenge dissolve in the back of your throat and nasopharynx. Cold-Eeze lozenges is one brand available, but there are other brands available. 

 

I, as many others do, hope that this pandemic will be reasonably contained, BUT I personally do not think it will be. BUT, there will be NO drugs or vaccines available this year to protect us or limit the infection within us. Only symptomatic support is available.

 

I hope these personal thoughts will be helpful during this potentially catastrophic pandemic. You are welcome to share this email. Good luck to all of us! Jim

 You should wear a mask when you go out I am a teenager and I have to carry 15 kg on my back every weekend while it's a hot and I have to wear a gas mask and walk 3 km back and forth, the gas mask is extremely uncomfortable and makes it hard to breathe in, but I still pull through and finish the job. So if I can do all that then you can wear a simple face mask just to go out, you're not gonna admit defeat to a teenager are you? Please wear a face mask when you leave your house, it's not that hard to do.

 How to coronavirus-proof your home By Scottie Andrew, CNN How to coronavirus-proof your home
By Scottie Andrew, CNN
Life under coronavirus means staying at home as much as possible — but you’ll likely need to make a trip to the grocery store or pharmacy at some point. Download or print this tip sheet to make sure you don’t bring the virus back home with you.
Note: Recommendations for Covid-19 may change as officials learn more, so monitor your local health department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for updates.
Make a game plan
Designate one person to be your errand-runner to limit your outside exposures
Set up a disinfecting station — an area outside your home or in a room with low foot trac where you can disinfect packaged food
When you’re out
Avoid coming within less than six feet of others Wipe handles on carts or baskets while shopping
You don’t have to have gloves or a mask — just wash your hands frequently while you’re out and avoid touching your face
When you get back
  Wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds
 
Disinfect takeout boxes and packaged foods at your disinfecting station Thoroughly wash produce before putting it in your kitchen
Disinfect
Disinfect everything you touch — doorknobs, light switches, keys, phone, keyboards, remotes, etc.
Use EPA-approved disinfectants (these include Clorox Disinfecting Wipes and certain Lysol sprays) and leave surfaces wet for 3-5 minutes
Delivery
Ask workers to drop deliveries o on your doorstep or an area of your complex If they need you to come to the door, keep six feet of distance
Pay and tip online when possible
After you pick up mail from your mailbox, wash your hands
Laundry
Wash clothes, towels and linens regularly on the warmest setting Disinfect your laundry hamper, too, or place a removable liner inside it Don’t shake dirty laundry to avoid dispersing the virus in the air
Guests
You shouldn’t allow guests over right now
If you need to house a family member or friend, avoid shared living spaces as much as you can
If they need to enter shared living spaces, ask them to keep six feet of distance
 
If someone in your home gets sick
First, consult your doctor
Isolate them in another room and ask them to use a separate restroom Disinfect frequently touched surfaces every day
Avoid sharing items with them
Wear gloves when washing their laundry
Continue to wash your hands frequently
Ask them to wear a face mask if they have one
Supplies you’ll need
EPA-approved disinfectants
If you don’t have disinfectants, make a bleach solution:
Mix four teaspoons bleach per quart of water; or
Use a 70% alcohol solution Laundry detergent
Trash bags
Prescription medicines (you can mail order these) Canned foods — fruits, veggies, beans
Dry goods — breads, pastas, nut butters
Frozen foods — meats, veggies, fruits
Pets
Supervise your pet in your backyard
It’s OK to play with them outside — just keep your distance from other humans
 
If you’re sick, ask someone you live with to take care of them while you recover If you must care for them while you’re sick, wash your hands frequently

 Do you know if there's a place or website you can put a design on a face mask? As the title says, I already wear masks and social distance when I go out, but I want to know if there's a place where I can put a picture or design on a mask. Sorry if this doesn't belong here I wasn't sure where to put it.

 Can you guys share your opinion on wearing face masks (surgical masks&amp;n95 masks)? I feel conflicted as a high school student in southern california when I choose to wear masks on the bus/in crowded areas. I know that health officials claim that wearing masks is actually worse/is not helpful but I don't really understand why. They say its because it causes people to touch their face more often and thus results in a higher chance of getting the virus. However, if thats the case then why do healthcare workers wear face masks in the hospitals and stuff (correct me if I'm wrong about this pls)? I just want to wear my mask for my own safety to try to protect myself as much as I can, but please share your thoughts... im open to it.

 Mandatory mask wearing compared to mandatory Speed Limits  

Saying "I have my rights, even though the mandate says "wear a mask", I can't wear a mask" is the equivalent of saying "I have my rights, even though the mandated speed limit says 55 mph, I can drive 90 if I want".

Literally every part of the Mask argument can be correlated with the speed limit argument.

"I can't wear a mask, I have a "health issue" ", is the same as saying "I can't drive at the speed limit, my eyesight is bad, and I can't see the sign." The speeder with bad eyesight would get pulled over and get his driver's license revoked or at the bare minimum receive a ticket because he/she could hurt themself or others. In the same way, the person with the supposed "health condition" would be hurting themself and/or others, and should be fined because of that.

"Masks should be a personal choice, not a government requirement" is the same as saying "How fast you want to go on the road should be a personal choice." Of course most people would say that you shouldn't be able to go 120 mph down the freeway, as you might hurt someone. The same thing applies to masks. People shouldn't be allowed to not wear masks, as they might hurt someone.

"Masks probably don't work anyways, why should I wear them" is the same as saying "Speed limits probably don't work anyways, why should I follow them". In 1973 Congress passed a law that lowered the federal speed limit to 55. In 1995, it got repealed, and since then there has been an extra 12,545 deaths (link: [ ) due to the higher speed limits. If everyone would just wear a mask, there would be less deaths, the same as if everyone just followed the speed limit.

"Only sick people need masks" is the same thing as "Only those who speed a lot need speed limits" . You might be the best social distancer around, but you might cough or sneeze by accident, and there is no telling if you're an asymptomatic carrier of COVID-19, and a mask would prevent or at least hamper transmission of the virus. Same with speeding. You might be distracted at the wheel, and that speedometer might go up to 90 mph cause you leaned in on the acceleration pedal. But just because that was your first speeding violation doesn't give you a right to just opt out of following the rules.

This list could go on and on, but whenever an Anti-masker tries to argue with you about wearing masks, just bring up speed limits and compare masks with that.

Hope I helped someone's argument, or at least gave you a good read.

 Please tell me why U.S media tell people that "Masks don't work" &amp; "Don't wear masks"??? Coronavirus, like many many other viruses is aerosol. It can stay in the air and be inhaled. It can also move with the wind and come to you and then be inhaled. It's really not rocket science to understand that wearing a mask SIGNIFICANTLY reduces chances of you inhaling this viral particle as it flies through the air. --&gt; THESE, are universally known facts. i.e. You don't have to be a doctor or Coronavirus scientist to know this. 

If your mask is a normal surgical mask, you get a decent protection compared to wearing nothing. If your mask is N95, you get SIGNIFICANTLY higher protection against the virus since N95 filter 95% of particulates. N99 masks are even more protective than N95s. --&gt; THESE, are universally known facts. i.e. You don't have to be a rocket scientist or Coronavirus knower to know this. 

What I don't understand is this --&gt; Why, on earth, U.S Media, and I mean EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM from CNN to FOX and all those in between, constantly and continously day &amp; night been promoting to the poor American people that "MASKS DONT WORK", "DONT WEAR MASK", I've even seen headlines such as "WEARING MASKS INCREASE YOUR CHANCE OF GETTING VIRUS". Can anyone tell me why on earth U.S &amp; its media is promoting these nonsense? Shouldn't those who distribute this nonsense be criminally prosecuted for the grieve damage they cause to many lives telling people to go unprotected when faced with an aerosol breathable virus?

 Noted Pathologist Writes This Viral Coronavirus Advice Letter- a.k.a. easy behavior changes to reduce your risk of exposure.  Okay. The sky is falling. You've purchased enough toilet paper  2-ply you to the moon and the space in all your closets is full of hand sanitizer and buckets of rice. You're sitting uneasily ~~on your couch/in the chair~~/on the toilet, device in hand, wondering what comes next. You scroll though the top sub-reddits and 

**BOOM! 7 behaviors to change right now!**

1) NO HANDSHAKING! Use a fist bump, slight bow, elbow bump, etc.

2) Use ONLY your knuckle to touch light switches. elevator buttons, etc.. Lift the gasoline dispenser with a paper towel or use a disposable glove.

3) Open doors with your closed fist or hip – do not grasp the handle with your hand, unless there is no other way to open the door. Especially important on bathroom and post office/commercial doors.

3) Open doors with your closed fist or hip – do not grasp the handle with your hand, unless there is no other way to open the door. Especially important on bathroom and post office/commercial doors.

4) Use disinfectant wipes at the stores when they are available, including wiping the handle and child seat in grocery carts.

5) Wash your hands with soap for 10-20 seconds and/or use a greater than 60% alcohol-based hand sanitizer whenever you return home from ANY activity that involves locations where other people have been.

6) Keep a bottle of sanitizer available at each of your home’s entrances. AND in your car for use after getting gas or touching other contaminated objects when you can’t immediately wash your hands.

7) If possible, cough or sneeze into a disposable tissue and discard. Use your elbow only if you have to. The clothing on your elbow will contain infectious virus that can be passed on for up to a week or more!

 What are the Laws with customers having to wear masks when inside businesses? I work at a Starbucks in downstate ny (25 miles north of Manhattan) and as of June 1st our store as well as many others in the whole country will open up for grab n go (meaning customers can come inside, wait in line, pay wait for drink, and go)..up to this point they could only pay on mobile app for curbside pickup.

As a company we are only enforcing mask wearing in store if the town/county is?  My question is as of June 1st is it still a law you must wear a mask to enter a business?  If it is we are allowed to turn away people without masks.  If it is not a law then we have to allow them though.

 why is it so difficult to import face masks why is it nearly impossible in the USA for anyone to import face masks? I'm working with a what appears to be reputable company on producing products and they have access to N95 masks and KN95 masks.

 I DO NOT WANT TO WEAR A MASK!   

**A Compromise.** 

I **100%** HATE wearing masks! I hate the way it feels on my face, I hate how it occasionally fogs up my glasses and I absolutely hate breathing in the warmth of the air I so recently exhaled. For reference, I have the homemade kind my mom made and shipped to me. And like I said I 100% am not a fan of wearing it! 

Here in America, one side wanted the economy reopened and does not want to have to wear masks when they go out shopping. The other side wants to stay closed until we have a handle on this virus, and wants the reassurance that when they do HAVE to go out, they are protected (or as protected as they can be) from others who may be sick. 

So what do we do?! We compromise! (For those of you who may have forgotten, a compromise is where nobody gets everything they want, but everyone gets something they want.) We compromise because that’s what adults do! We understand that there are other people in this country who may want something besides what we want. There are people who want guns, and some who don’t. Some people want marijuana to be legalized, and others who don’t want it legalized. There are millions of things where people are of opposing minds. 

America is now slowly reopening, but the stipulation, THE COMPROMISE, is that when we are asked to wear masks in a store, we do so. Not every store will require you to wear a mask but when they do, remember that you are standing inside a business that just a few days ago was closed. This is what you wanted! Why is that not good enough?! Why must you resort to violence or immature name calling? Why do you have to be rude or mean to the clerk or even business manager who is not making the decision if their store will require masks be worn? Why can’t you just compromise and wear the itchy, annoying, pain in the butt mask, to keep the peace and potentially keep the high risk store clerk, that you demanded come back to work, safe? I hate it too! But, I will do it without question because it’s the compromise made so I can go get my haircut!

Does soap/sanitizer keep killing bacteria, viruses for a good while after applying?

 CDC told you not to wear mask but trust me, wear mask everyone I’m Thai and all I wanna say is just wear mask guys, I read a lot of news article and from CDC that told u guys not to wear if you are not sick or healthy but trust me, you need to wear them. I mean like base on my country that wearing mask is normal and a lot of people here wearing mask and tbh, it help to reduce spend the virus a LOT like a lot. We see a lot of case like in Europe or anywhere else that people usually not wear mask and the increasing rate of patients is like increase all the time. So I’m help to help you guy. Stay clean, eat hot food, use table spoon, washing hand and wear mask and this simple step will help you far from virus.

READ EXCELLENT FACT BASED INFORMATION AND ADVICE

A detailed advice  from an expert doctor from the UofM Medical School,

 

Subject: What I am doing for the upcoming COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic

 

Dear Colleagues, as some of you may recall, when I was a professor of pathology at the University of California San Diego, I was one of the first molecular virologists in the world to work on coronaviruses (the 1970s). I was the first to demonstrate the number of genes the virus contained. Since then, I have kept up with the coronavirus field and its multiple clinical transfers into the human population (e.g., SARS, MERS), from different animal sources. The current projections for its expansion in the US are only probable, due to continued insufficient worldwide data, but it is most likely to be widespread in the US by mid to late March and April. 

 

Here is what I have done and the precautions that I take and will take. These are the same precautions I currently use during our influenza seasons, except for the mask and gloves.: 

1) NO HANDSHAKING! Use a fist bump, slight bow, elbow bump, etc.

2) Use ONLY your knuckle to touch light switches. elevator buttons, etc.. Lift the gasoline dispenser with a paper towel or use a disposable glove. 

3) Open doors with your closed fist or hip - do not grasp the handle with your hand, unless there is no other way to open the door. Especially important on bathroom and post office/commercial doors. 

4) Use disinfectant wipes at the stores when they are available, including wiping the handle and child seat in grocery carts.

5) Wash your hands with soap for 10-20 seconds and/or use a greater than 60% alcohol-based hand sanitizer whenever you return home from ANY activity that involves locations where other people have been. 

6) Keep a bottle of sanitizer available at each of your home's entrances. AND in your car for use after getting gas or touching other contaminated objects when you can't immediately wash your hands. 

7) If possible, cough or sneeze into a disposable tissue and discard. Use your elbow only if you have to. The clothing on your elbow will contain infectious virus that can be passed on for up to a week or more!

 

What I have stocked in preparation for the pandemic spread to the US:

 

1) Latex or nitrile latex disposable gloves for use when going shopping, using the gasoline pump, and all other outside activity when you come in contact with contaminated areas. 

 

Note: This virus is spread in large droplets by coughing and sneezing. This means that the air will not infect you! BUT all the surfaces where these droplets land are infectious for about a week on average - everything that is associated with infected people will be contaminated and potentially infectious. The virus is on surfaces and you will not be infected unless your unprotected face is directly coughed or sneezed upon.  This virus only has cell receptors for lung cells (it only infects your lungs) The only way for the virus to infect you is through your nose or mouth via your hands or an infected cough or sneeze onto or into your nose or mouth. 

 

2) Stock up now with disposable surgical masks and use them to prevent you from touching your nose and/or mouth (We touch our nose/mouth 90X/day without knowing it!). This is the only way this virus can infect you - it is lung-specific. The mask will not prevent the virus in a direct sneeze from getting into your nose or mouth - it is only to keep you from touching your nose or mouth.

 

3) Stock up now with hand sanitizers and latex/nitrile gloves (get the appropriate sizes for your family). The hand sanitizers must be alcohol-based and greater than 60% alcohol to be effective. 

 

4) Stock up now with zinc lozenges. These lozenges have been proven to be effective in blocking coronavirus (and most other viruses) from multiplying in your throat and nasopharynx. Use as directed several times each day when you begin to feel ANY "cold-like" symptoms beginning. It is best to lie down and let the lozenge dissolve in the back of your throat and nasopharynx. Cold-Eeze lozenges is one brand available, but there are other brands available. 

 

I, as many others do, hope that this pandemic will be reasonably contained, BUT I personally do not think it will be. Humans have never seen this snake-associated virus before and have no internal defense against it. Tremendous worldwide efforts are being made to understand the molecular and clinical virology of this virus. Unbelievable molecular knowledge about the genomics, structure, and virulence of this virus has already been achieved. BUT, there will be NO drugs or vaccines available this year to protect us or limit the infection within us. Only symptomatic support is available. I hope these personal thoughts will be helpful during this potentially catastrophic pandemic. You are welcome to share this email. 

 

Good luck to all of us!

 Be vigilante against people selling face masks with “filtration” provided I work in the industrial filtration industry and I’ve seen a lot of people selling face masks on my social media that can’t answer any type of basic filtration questions. 

For instance, anyone claiming that their mask provides some type of filtration should be questioned about:

1.	What micron level does the media they use in their face masks provide?

The coronavirus is 0.06 micron. The human eye can only see down to 40 micron without assistance. A red blood cell is 6 micron. 

Most people I’ve seen have offered polypropylene filtration (if they know what they’re putting in at all) and the tightest micron in polypropylene we provide is 0.5 micron. In micro fiberglass we go down to 0.1 &amp; 0.3 micron. 

There are companies that provide tighter filtration but these are specialized medias that I don’t expect most people in our neighborhoods have access to. 

2.	What is the beta ratio of your filter media?

Anyone can say they have 0.1 micron filtration in the media they use. The fact of the matter is all media will catch X size particle. What is important is the beta ratio (efficiency) of the filter media. 0.1 micron @ 99% (Beta 100) is not the same as 0.1 micron @ 99.98% (Beta 5000 - industry standard) media. 

For visual sake, 99% efficiency (Beta 100) means for every 100,000 particles, 1,000 will make it through. For 99.98% efficiency (Beta 5000), for every 100,000 particles, 2 will make it through. 

At the end of the day, I see a lot of people claiming their filters are specific percentage capture rate without backing it up with efficiency ratings. In the filter world, we don’t have standardized testing for filters. This means that a company can claim they have 2 micron filters because, at some point during testing, they caught a 2 micron particle; this doesn’t mean they catch 2 micron particles efficiently. 

3.	Is the mask going to create a seal on your face?

A filter is only as good as the seal it provides. You can have a filter on your face but if the particles have the chance to bypass that filter and deep through in other ways then there’s no point to the “filter”. I, personally, wear a cotton mask (re: bandana with rubber bands) when I’m out in public because I don’t have access to anything else. If we’re all wearing cotton masks then, sure, it works for the most part but I’m not pretending I have any sort of efficient filtration against a 0.06 micron particle with all the bypass issues and lack of pressure across my nose and mouth. 

There’s a reason doctors are utilizing tape and multiple layers to prevent infection. 

4.	What’s the point?

There’s no point. I just wanted to dispel some of the things I’ve seen on social media. Cotton masks with rubber bands are helping, no doubt, but I just wanted to ensure no one is spending money on neighborhood masks from people who don’t understand filtration and what we’re up against. 

If the person you’re buying from doesn’t know the size of the coronavirus then that would be a red flag to me. 

5.	Charts on Reddit

A lot of this goes for the charts I’ve seen posted on reddit regarding a cotton dish towel being 70% efficient. Efficient how? Who is standardizing these numbers against coronavirus? It’s comical.

 Amazon and online deliveries - are they a risk? Having to rely on online orders a lot of late, I've been washing my hands after opening and disposing of the initial outer packaging, but do I need to do anything with what is inside? 

Dog toys, clothing (examples of things I've received, other than food) etc, which are in their own packaging anyway, inside the outer packaging, do they all need to be washed before use or are they generally okay to use?
++++++++++
 Is there a point in continuing to pretend that covid will be contained in the USA? All this about wearing a mask and changing our lives - well if covid is going to infect everyone in the USA anyway then why am I supposed to bother trying to avoid it? The cat is out of the bag right?
++++++++++
 You don’t need permission to wear a mask! Why exactly are there so many posts about wearing masks?! Is it the societal validation? I don’t understand. It’s not illegal to wear a mask or face covering! If I was lucky enough to have one of those legit consumer surgical care masks (like you get from the drugstore/grocery store) you bet I would be wearing one! Just do it. But if you are, wear them CORRECTLY. Nothing more irritating than seeing an ignoramus not wearing them or using them appropriately!! 

PS: I HOPE that these mask manufacturers will get to the point where they can redirect some of their shipments back to the stores for consumers or Amazon gets them back in stock soon so we can all have those nice surgical quality ones. But for now I’ll settle for a bandanna and common sense! I think anything is better than nothing at this point!!
++++++++++
 I see so many people not wearing masks!! :( Why is it that as the numbers of corona cases go up it seems like less and less people are wearing masks? My 10 year old child the other day was asking me do I really need to wear a mask and it kind of shook me... What should I tell my kids?   


Even I don't really know which mask to get and why I need to be wearing one if everyone around me is not wearing one. Does't wearing masks really help us if everyone else is just saying yolo? Also if everyone is not going to wear a mask then which mask should I get for my family and kids so that I can safely protect my family? Thank you for the advice in advance...

1) Latex or nitrile latex disposable gloves for use when going shopping, using the gasoline pump, and all other outside activity when you come in contact with contaminated areas.
Note: This virus is spread in large droplets by coughing and sneezing. This means that the air will not infect you! BUT all the surfaces where these droplets land are infectious for about a week on average - everything that is associated with infected people will be contaminated and potentially infectious. The virus is on surfaces and you will not be infected unless your unprotected face is directly coughed or sneezed upon.
This virus only has cell receptors for lung cells (it only infects your lungs) The only way for the virus to infect you is through your nose or mouth via your hands or an infected cough or sneeze onto or into your nose or mouth.
2) Stock up now with disposable surgical masks and use them to prevent you from touching your nose and/or mouth (We touch our nose/mouth 90X/day without knowing it!). This is the only way this virus can infect you - it is lung-specific. The mask will not prevent the virus in a direct sneeze from getting into your nose or mouth - it is only to keep you from touching your nose or mouth.
3) Stock up now with hand sanitizers and latex/nitrile gloves (get the appropriate sizes for your family). The hand sanitizers must be alcohol-based and greater than 60% alcohol to be effective.
4) Stock up now with zinc lozenges. These lozenges have been proven to be effective in blocking coronavirus (and most other viruses) from multiplying in your throat and nasopharynx. Use as directed several times each day when you begin to feel ANY "cold-like" symptoms beginning. It is best to lie down and let the lozenge dissolve in the back of your throat and nasopharynx. Cold-Eeze lozenges is one brand available, but there are other brands available.
I, as many others do, hope that this pandemic will be reasonably contained, BUT I personally do not think it will be. Humans have never seen this snake-associated virus before and have no internal defense against it.
Tremendous worldwide efforts are being made to understand the molecular and clinical virology of this virus. Unbelievable molecular knowledge about the genomics, structure, and virulence of this virus has already been achieved. BUT, there will be NO drugs or vaccines available this year to protect us or limit the infection within us. Only symptomatic support is available.
I hope these personal thoughts will be helpful during this potentially catastrophic pandemic. You are welcome to share.

Good luck to all of us!

 20 seconds hand wash is longer than you think Most people "wash" their hands by splashing some water on them, then a little soap, and scrub for 5 seconds. Restrooms should have a little timer countdown or something haha.

Also people have to remember, you wash your hands. Great. But now you go and touch the cell phone, door handle, etc. That you touched with your dirty hands basically making your washing void.

 Father picked up something off the floor and didn't wash his hands So I was walking to the kitchen this morning for breakfast, finding my father was at the counter taking his daily meds. He dropped one of the pills on the floor, picked it up, threw it away and didn't wash his hands. He then continued to take his meds with his now dirty unwashed hands. I now worry that he may have compromised himself, because the floor is dirty and possibly has residual covid on it. On top of that, yesterday he went to do grocery pick up, and when we wiped everything down, the plastic bags were strewn across the floor, which also possibly could have had bits of the virus on them, and then smeared that that onto the floor to. I'm worried sick about my father now, and I really need advice right now.

 We created a free platform to connect people who need masks with the crafty humans willing to make and donate them [US] We wanted to help fix this problem by doing what we do best—creating technology and connecting people. That’s why we created MaskHelpers, a free platform that connects those who need free, non-medical grade, reusable masks with the kind people willing to make and donate them. 

Here’s how it works.

**Maybe you need a mask…**

If you need a non-medical grade face mask, visit [MaskHelpers.org]( and submit a request. Your request will be sent to a queue for mask makers to see. When a mask maker selects your request, they will make your mask(s) and mail them your way. No cost to you.

**Or maybe you can make masks…**

Mask makers are people with sewing skills who can create non-medical grade face masks. Are you one of them? Register at [maskhelpers.org]( and make as many masks as your schedule and budget allow. 

There is no better time to dig out that sewing machine. You don’t have to be a professional dressmaker or tailor to pitch in. 

We know that many of you are willing to help make masks but may be short on materials. No worries. We’re also connecting people who are willing to donate supplies (fabric, postage stamps, etc.) with mask makers.

There are other ways to help: 

* Wear a mask. If you wear a mask when you leave your house—you’re already helping. Thank you.
* Donate materials. Fabric. Thread. Elastic. Envelopes. Stamps. You might have stuff already lying around your house. You may have the resources to purchase materials. We’ll connect you with mask makers who need more supplies.
* Tell everyone. Let everyone know how they can help—your friends, your co-workers, your grandparents. Post on your social media. The more people know, the more people we can all help. Thank you!

 Wearing a medical mask as a personal intimacy shield Wow, I absolutely love wearing medical masks when outside. I despise eye contact and wear sunglasses as much as possible to avoid eye contact, and if I just talk to someone, I can use the sunglasses to prevent getting that yucky personal eye contact intimacy I hate with strangers, coworkers and stuff.

But damn. The medical masks bring it to a new level. I get why before the virus, many people wore them in Korea. Apparently it’s a shield to ward off unwanted socialization and to keep a larger personal bubble. Now that it’s pretty acceptable to wear masks on America, I feel liberated. Between the masks and sunglasses, I have less stress going out. I can pretty much put a huge wall between me and most people I have no desire to being intimate with while going about my day. Hell, even after this virus Dissipates, I am probably going to continue to wear the mask and say I am immune compromised and need to wear it for my safety (saying I’m autistic and like wearing masks IS NOT a good excuse to avoid negative reactions. I take my sunglasses (and sometimes mask) off when I am comfortable with someone. But for most, I DO NOT want the neurotypical intimacy that comes with eye contact and facial expressions.

Anyone else in the same boat? Feel the same, have the same visceral reactions?
