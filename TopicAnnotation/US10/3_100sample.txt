 Alternative approaches to "flattening the curve" As a result of easing the country into our current quasi-Lockdown, the opportunity to have any public discussion on alternative strategies to go about "flattening the curve" never took place. 

It is almost frightening at the ease of which our society has generally accepted the current approach as the ONLY way possible to achieve this goal.

I have an alternative approach that I would like to get feedback/discussion over regarding it's effectiveness in "flattening the curve."

Instead of placing our entire country in a quasi-Lockdown, and effectively shutting down the economy. Why not place the at risk individuals in an actual, no b.s., lockdown?

Would this not better protect the "at risk" while having a lesser impact on our economy? 

Would this also not be an effective way to "flatten the curve? "

 1 in every 1,000 USA citizens infected by tomorrow (0.1% population) Today the USA has 0.094% of its population infected. With this rate, it will be 0.1% tomorrow.  


Without containment measures, it would take about 2-3 weeks to have 1 every 100 citizens infected. Other countries like Italy, Spain etc are seeing a slowing down effect from containment measures after 0.1% mark. I am expecting the same in USA.  


1 in every 100 citizen (3.3 million  people) will hopefully be the peak with all the measures considered. This would be aligned with the 100,000 to 200,000 deaths that officials have estimated.  


Italy currently has 0.2% of its population infected and Spain 0.26%.

 With the number of people hitting park grounds, some localities are now thinking of shutting all parks down. Should the local running and cycling groups be at the forefront of education on social distancing outdoors and post volunteers with signs helping to encourage proper behavior and flow? An example of what's happening in NC (second video down in the link). Many places are similar or worse. Where are those run and cycle groups when we need them - placing SOLO volunteers with info to encourage folks to space out and slow down near crowded bottlenecks? Do we really want / need the police patrolling the parks to prevent overcrowding? Sure enough, it's much easier for the local authorities to just shut the places down and deal with trespassers.

 (Discussion) Impact on US Local Music Scene/Shows? I have not seen any discussion on this topic and would like to see what others think. Large commercial/professional concerts and tours have been noted as risky due to a close gathering of many people, but I am wondering about smaller local music show gatherings which are a popular and ongoing activity in many cities and suburbs that I'm aware of.

In my area, the Northeast, local and regional bands and events can draw crowds (including musicians and attendees) of 30 - 150+ regularly on multiple days of the week, especially weekends. Examples in the NE include smaller but popular venues in Boston/Cambridge, Worcester MA, Providence/Newport RI, and other locations in CT, NY, NJ. I'm not sure how active these scenes are in other areas of the country (any thoughts?)

Being somewhat involved in this scene myself, I have not seen much acknowledgement on social media or elsewhere of local music events being a possible vector for community spread of the virus in the Northeast. I have seen a few memes being shared, some arguing, some jokes. I have not personally yet seen any serious updates or discussion by bands, event pages, or promoters with regard to this situation.

Further, I wanted to post this for discussion due to the nature of these events: An open mic or karaoke night may be easier to maintain social distance, but a rock show may involve sweat, crowding, moshing or a pit, hugging/high fiving, and other very close contact of a lot of people. Key factors include general admission (standing room only) and smaller, densely gathered spaces. Venues with bars may also have a risk of drunk people not paying attention to preventive measures or maintaining distance in crowds, etc.

That being said, I'd like to start discussion on the local music/bar scene in your region, the risk of community spread, any measures you've seen or would like to see, what would you do if you were running or participating in an event scheduled like this in the next week or month, any thoughts, ideas, or concerns?

 Less mobility reduction in US compared to other countries per Google's data. Google has been publishing anonymous [mobility data]( based on the location of their devices. This data can give a sense of how much social distancing is taking place based on the total reduction of traffic to each category that they track.

The categories tracked are Retail &amp; recreation, Grocery &amp; pharmacy, Parks, Transit stations, Workplaces, and Residential.

I noticed that when comparing the mobility data between countries, however, that there are some significant differences.

When comparing countries to the US, Italy and Spain seem to be logical candidates because the spread and trajectory of the virus has been similar in all three countries.

Here are some of the numbers from the most recent report:

Italy:

* Retail &amp; Recreation: -95%
* Grocery &amp; Pharmacy: -82%
* Parks: -90%
* Transit Stations: -86%
* Workplaces: -62%
* Residential: +24%

If these percentages are converted to decimals and added together, we can get a total number that represents the overall mobility reduction of all cumulative categories. This number for Italy comes out to: -3.91.

Spain:

* Retail &amp; Recreation: -94%
* Grocery &amp; Pharmacy: -77%
* Parks: -90%
* Transit Stations: -89%
* Workplaces: -68%
* Residential: +23%

Spain's total: -3.95.

US:

* Retail &amp; Recreation: -49%
* Grocery &amp; Pharmacy: -20%
* Parks: -20%
* Transit Stations: -54%
* Workplaces: -40%
* Residential: +13%

US's total: -1.7.

Based on this, it would appear than countries such as Italy and Spain are reducing their mobility to a much greater degree than we are in the US, more than twice as much in fact. Italy and Spain have so far had more success with flattening and bending their curves than the US. I am concerned that because mobility in the US has not been reduced nearly as much as these other countries, that we may not have similar levels of success in terms of reducing the spread of the virus.

 Question: would doing nothing about covid be good or bad for the economy long term? Debating with someone that ignoring Coronavirus would be detrimental to the economy in itself due to the sheer number of deaths that will result.

Their argument is that mostly older people die from the virus so the economy would benefit not being shut down, maybe even benefit from a mostly older population that burden the economy passing away.

I disagree, but only found this one article in my defense.



 However, it doesn't take in account the age differences in covid deaths. 

Theres alot of focus on the long term economic efforts of shut down right now, but I believe the economic impact would be less than in a scenario where we didnt shut down, because the sheer death toll would be more detrimental long term to the economy.

Can some people weigh in, with supporting evidence? Thanks

 Movie theaters I’m not sure how far we are from theaters opening again in some states but what is your opinion on the mom reopening. Would you see a movie during the summer? I expect most movies running to be classics or maybe past big summer movies like Spider-Man far from home. I think movie theaters could open at limited capacity (maybe 25-50%). The biggest problem would be keeping the theaters clean and making sure people follow guidelines. I could see movies being popular just due to people being anxious and wanting to see movies on a big screen again.

 Evidence that COVID-19 is spreading faster in the US than in other countries Due to a lack of testing, there's a lot we still don't know about how rampant COVID-19 is in the USA. Even with minimal testing, however, **the US is still seeing faster sustained increases in the number of COVID-19 cases relative to other countries in the world**. How do I know? Look at this graph.  



What is this? The lines show change over time in daily percent increase of reported COVID-19 cases (total cases known on a given day/total cases known the previous day) across several countries. There is also a line showing the average across the 8 countries whose epidemics have lasted at least as long as the USA's (26 days; China, South Korea, Iran, Italy, France, Germany, Spain, USA). There are also lines indicating the average +/- 1 standard deviation.  

All countries have been made comparable by starting the clock on the day each country reached its 100th reported case. On the horizontal axis, you see how many days have elapsed since the 100th case in a given country was reported. The vertical axis shows by what percent the number of new cases in the country grew on each day. Data: [

You will notice that as countries get farther into their epidemics, the daily percent increase tends to decline. In South Korea (red line), daily increases declined more rapidly than average. Italy has recently followed the average pretty closely. **But starting about halfway through its epidemic (day 13), the USA (blue line) has seen daily increases well above average** (even above average +1 StDev!). Cases seem to be building slightly less rapidly in recent days, but we are still not testing at the rate we should be, and are likely missing many cases. The rate of known cases could spike again in the coming weeks as we ramp up testing--sending us above average again. 

**In short, while increases seem to be slowing down a bit in the USA, they are still increasing faster than pretty much all other countries.** We will see whether this trend continues or if the US gets more in line with other countries' trajectories.

 COVID-19 deaths in the US compared to 18 other countries (University of Pennsylvania) Americans are dying at far higher rates than other countries after you control for population. 



Researchers at University of Pennsylvania compared US to 18 other countries and found that the US experienced high COVID-19–associated mortality and excess all-cause mortality into September 2020. After the first peak in early spring, US death rates from COVID-19 and from all causes remained higher than even countries with high COVID-19 mortality. This may have been a result of several factors, including weak public health infrastructure and a decentralized, inconsistent US response to the pandemic. ([Here's a link to the study](

Is this just the dynamic of the virus? Or do we as a whole take it more seriously as we get near a peak and as a result see the number of cases drop.

 DAILY UPDATE Coronavirus US % growth for March 27 - trends are mixed, with confirmed cases slightly down and deaths slightly up Below is a summary of the **US** trends yesterday (late EST), available [in more detail here]( (now including individual country breakdowns, updated automatically once a day). I give a more broad summary on the [Global trends here](

I've also [started vlogging]( a take that's half analytical, and half covering the day's Reddit and Twitter threads.

**Confirmed Cases**

This daily delta for confirmed cases yesterday was down. A total of **17,821** new cases. Although still the 2nd highest increase ever.

The growth rate was down at the lowest since March 18, at **21.26%**.

Note that the testing capabilities may have risen in general, and there may also be a larger amount of people testing negative. I'd love to have access to that data too, but so far we don't

**Deaths**

It was another all time high again yesterday in the increase in deaths. The total increase was **372**.

That brings the growth rate to **30.8%** yesterday. If the trend follows other countries, this rate will decrease as the number rises.

The WHO death rate went up slightly to **1.5%** yesterday, after 2 consecutive days at 1.4% (this is the rate that the media was often citing at being 1-2% in February).

I've consistently chosen to additionally track the death rate on the number of recovered. This is still consistently climbing, once more at a new peak yesterday, of **64.5%** (NOTE: *John Hopkins CSSE have announced they are soon going to cease tracking the number of recovered, so this stat won't be available for much longer!*)*.*

**Incubation Deaths**

The rate that takes into account the 14 day incubation period, comparing the number of deaths yesterday to the number of confirmed cases 14 days ago. This is still increasing, once more at an all time high, at **42.0%**.

**Disclaimer:** *Please take from this what you choose. Even though I've started to track individual country data, it may still be too small to associate any defining trends from the % growth.*

*I am just breaking down official numbers, and although the official numbers may or may not reflect exactly how many cases remain unreported, I try to remain unopinionated in these reportings and leave the opinions and analysis to the comments*

 Shared ventilation in residential buildings Has anyone thought about the potential for disease spread in large residential buildings like apartment complexes that share HVAC units? I would think it would be risky to isolate in a large building with an infected person if you don’t have separate HVAC units. Many people will have no choice. These buildings are very common in large cities. It might be a negligible risk because the ducts are likely longer than 6 feet from unit to unit, but if there is a risk, maybe mitigation strategies would be helpful. Thoughts?

Fortunately we were able to stop a lot of them and made them to go back to the other side of their country. You know the US is the country with almost most cases of people infected with Coronavirus and we don't want you to come and spread your virus over our place. Mexico has some cases of people infected confirmed already yet our country is still safer than many others because there aren't many cases confirmed here compared to other countries like in the US. 

Y'all always judging the Mexicans and disapproving our coming to your country in the look of better opportunities to survive. Now you're the ones trying to come to our country and guess what? We will treat you the same way you all use to treat us before all these begging to happen. Yall treat us like shit discriminating us while saying things like "get back to your country fucking beaner" "we don't want you in the US you stupid Mexicans", etc.

Well guess what? We don't want y'all americans neither. Unless you have never been like this type of people we might give you an opportunity to find refuge in our place.

 Why can't we blame protests on coronavirus spikes? Before I begin to get beheaded by the community, I am all for protesting, I admire everyone protesting and am glad they're using their presence to voice their opinion.  

Currently there is a protest at Washington DC for the 57th Anniversary of MLK's "I have a dream" speech. I agree with the reasoning behind the protest.  

The media is SILENT that this can spread the virus, they'll talk about Usain Bolt contracting the virus after his large unmasked party and the repercussions of it. The influencers and their house parties. Even schools opening and the risks of the large crowds. 

As someone who does their part and even got the virus regardless of my best efforts to prevent it (mild case). I am just baffled.

Why does no one bring up these protests for possibly adding fuel to the outbreak? 



Please, be nice in the comments. I am purely asking because I am curious to know if others think like this. Because when I see comments on reddit that say anything about protests and rise in cases they are down voted into oblivion.

 Profit is also necessary for public health I understand that we are concerned about coronavirus. And I'm not saying that we should open all businesses right now. But companies need to stay open. 7 million people starved to death in the great depression. That's about 1/10th of the US population during that time. And that's only the people who died due to starvation.

As we increase our medical capacity we need to start allowing businesses to open. We can start with most necessary and move to less necessary. But we can't just shut the economy down for 2 months or 6 months or 18 months. Most small businesses can't make it one month. In a capitalist economy, if there isn't a monopoly in the sector then people have to operate on very small margins to stay competitive. Which means they don't have large caches of money to throw at workers. 

Trump has asked states to withhold unemployment statistics. Which is a very bad sign. We can't ignore coronavirus patients, but we can't ignore the economy either.

 Which way are things going? 

This map shows recent COVID-19 Trends with arrows that represent each county's recent trend history, and weekly new case counts for U.S. counties. 

The map data is updated weekly.

It shows COVID-19 Trend for the most recent Monday with a colored arrow for each county. The larger the arrow, the longer the county has had this trend.  An up arrow indicates the number of active cases continue upward. A down arrow indicates the number of active cases is going down.

The intent of this map is to give more context than just the current day of new data because daily data for COVID-19 cases is volatile and can be unreliable on the day it is first reported. Weekly summaries in the counts of new cases smooth out this volatility.

Click or tap on a county to see a history of trend changes and a weekly graph of new cases going back to February 1, 2020. 

This map is updated every Tuesday based on data through the previous Sunday.  [See also this version of the map]( for additional perspective.

COVID-19 Trends show how each county is doing and are updated daily. We base the trend assignment on the number of new cases in the past two weeks and the number of active cases per 100,000 people. To learn the details for how trends are assigned, see the [full methodology]( There are five trends:
* Emergent - New cases for the first time or in counties that have had zero new cases for 60 or more days.
* Spreading - Low to moderate rates of new cases each day. Likely controlled by local policies and individuals taking measures such as wearing masks and curtailing unnecessary activities.
* Epidemic - Accelerating and uncontrolled rates of new cases.
* Controlled - Very low rates of new cases.
* End Stage - One or fewer new cases every 5 days in larger populations and fewer in rural areas.

For more information about COVID-19 trends, see the [full methodology](

 For those with IBD and are concerned. All-

As a 21/yo with UC, I have been pretty concerned about how my body will react to the virus and how dangerous being infected would be.

After some digging, I have found a pretty good decision tree visual from Crohns and Colitis UK that can help individuals assess their own risk factors. I figured it would be a helpful thing to share with the community, especially those with IBD themselves or loved ones who suffer from IBD. See link below :)

 They need to stop/stall all court proceedings I know it's stalled in some states/counties but not everywhere and me and others going to the court house multiple times a day is exposing so many people. My city is about 70% down but still saw 20+ people sitting in a court room for petty court proceedings, mostly traffic ticket related and that's happening twice a week still not to mention the other 10+ court rooms still being used. I haven't seen a single drop in court house traffic since this broke out yet so many businesses/bars/ social events are closed in my area. Picking and choosing wont work, we need a full stop to stop the spread.

 How are you guys dealing with the rent being due and your job closing due to the shut down? Not everyone has months of savings to pay for their rent, food and other bills during this Covid-19 situation. 

I don’t need rude comments, just sincere answers from people who has to pay their rent but has lost their jobs/have to take care of their family. I’m due in a couple weeks and my landlord has been stressing me a lot that my rent is a few days past due. 

She said she understood,
but then a few days later whenever she feels stressed, she would message me and tell me she won’t kick me out but she will disconnect everything and I need to pay. 

How are you guys mainly dealing with paying for the rent during this stressful time?

 Why is my temperature always coming out “high?” This is one of the weirdest things that has been happening to me lately, and I’m getting concerned.

A month and a half ago, I tried getting my driver license. My mom came with. Before we could enter the building, everyone had to get their temps taken. We stood behind a line of people, and it was pretty hot outside. The authorities used those thermometers that they hover over your forehead. No one in front of me had a temperature that was considered high, but when they checked mine they said it was 102 degrees (???!!!). So they told me to go back inside my car, turn the AC on high, and come back after 5-10 mins. I came back, and it was a little over 102 again. Then I came back a 3rd time and it was 103??? What is a person with a 103 degree temperature doing walking about? They would be sick as shit. 

When I got back in the car and turned on the AC I felt my skin and it did not feel warm at all. No chills or anything. I did not feel sick at all.

Flash forward a month and a half later. Yesterday, me and my sister were picking my mom up from the hospital (she did not have coronavirus she just had a visit). My sister told me to go in the building. This time a nurse at the front desk used a thermal imaging camera, and once again my temperature was considered high. They did not say the exact numbers. My sister went in and picked her up. This time I was inside, away from the heat. When I told my mom about it she took my temperature at home with the thermometer you put under the tongue. It was normal. What’s going on? I never feel sick, but my temperature is always high?

I start college soon and I’m worried they won’t allow me in because of high readings that keep showing up when I’m tested.
