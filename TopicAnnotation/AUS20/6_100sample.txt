 I want to be optimistic about our line flattening so badly, but then I see things like this - this is NSW’s chart. If we’re flattening the testing line, doesn’t it make sense we’d flatten the curve? Please help me understand this

 Flatten the curve The messaging from all Australian media is now focussing on self quarantine, social distancing, avoiding large events, the list goes on. This is good messaging, it’s all towards all of us “flattening the curve” so as to ensure our hospitals facilities remain available for those that need them. I think this messaging is late, but will still significantly help, it’s a good thing

 Just me, or is Scotty from Marketing's walkback for social distancing in schools a little like telling the police that as their paper shields are ineffective against gunfire, they will be taken from them immediately... 80% attendance today...it's like we're trying to catch up with the rest of the world.

 Don't flatten the curve, bend it: the fatal flaw in our COVID-19 strategy "Flatten the curve" is one of the great public health messaging success stories of our time. Along with a simple graphic, it has become ubiquitous and remarkably effective in communicating the need for social distancing to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. But for all its impact, it may actually be leading our decision-makers astray: rather than flattening the curve, we should instead be aiming to dramatically "bend the curve" to reduce the total number of infections and save lives.”

 I need your help improving Victoria Governments Corona virus transparency. The existing Covid data released by Vic Health is lacking in comparison to data released by NSW health.

I believe that a publicly accessible data source detailing the local health district or postcode of Victorian Covid cases with an unidentifiable source, would be of great benefit to all Australians. 

This data would keep the Victorian public well informed of the spread of Covid within the community.

If you also believe this data should be publicly released I would urge you to contact Vic Data: [here](

Stay safe, wash ya' hands, be kind.

 COVIDSafe and suspect behaviour I’m just gonna flat out ask the question on everyone’s mind. Will the authorities ever be able to use the data from COVIDSafe to link to behaviour that may considered suspect?

We all know what the apps intended use is, we all know they have said that it’s data will only be used for assisting the community in the Coronavirus crisis - but can they/will they/what will happen if they use the data to assist in other enquires not related to the Covid-19 pandemic?

Asking for a friend...

 How reasonable is it to claim we're flattening the curve? How reliable are these claims? Numbers are looking positive. However, we've had reasonably restrictive testing criteria. Is it reasonable to claim we're flattening the curve? 

If we don't know how widespread infection is within the community (e.g. those that don't meet previous and current testing criteria), is it somewhat misleading to claim we're suppressing the curve? 

Isn't the available data only telling us we're suppressing the curve for infections of international travellers and their directly traceable contacts?

Please don't mistake my questions for alarmism. It seems totally justified to be celebrating a declining doubling rate.  I'm just looking for an informed, objective assessment of how believable announcements of curve suppression are. Is there more to our available data? Does it tell us more than we think about community transmission? 

What's the argument for considering curve suppression claims compelling?

Would be awesome to hear from people with medical, epidemiological, data analysis, etc., skill/knowledge?
