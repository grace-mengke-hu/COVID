 Lessons from history So chatting with elderly parents today. Finally learned why father was never christened. There was a polio epidemic in the late 1930s. No large gatherings and schools closed. (According to family memory). Polio has a r0 of 5-7. Obviously covid 19 varies but seems to be at least 1-3. Higher if it gets out of control.
Interesting that we could close schools at that time (and yes I realise life was v different back then regarding likelihood of both parents working).

 Parents are pulling their children out of schools that neighbour the affected Sydney schools  Worried parents rushed to Willoughby Public School on Monday morning to pull their children out of class after the NSW government closed the neighbouring high school because a year 7 student was diagnosed with COVID-19.

The public primary school informed parents via email that NSW Health had closed Willoughby Girls High “until further notice” and that they could pick their children up if they were concerned about the spread of the virus.

Louise Relf, whose two children, Zoe, 9 and Fletcher, 7, attend Willoughby Public, told The Australian she had decided to take her children out of school as a “precaution.”

“I was a bit worried when the school told us that Willoughy Girls had been closed down because of the coronavirus,” she said. “I think it’s better to be safe than sorry"

 Private school funding under threat if schools close against government advice on coronavirus  

Prime Minister Scott Morrison has warned independent schools their funding might be at risk if they defy government advice and close due to the COVID-19 threat.

Mr Morrison spoke to school leaders on Wednesday, including the head of the Australian Independent Schools NSW Geoff Newcombe.

 

Dr Newcombe subsequently sent a letter to all his members about the conversation, in which Mr Morrison "reminded me that in this situation there were certain expectations attached to the recurrent funding provided by the Australian Government to Catholic and independent schools.

"He asked if I would convey this message to schools in our association, as well as colleagues in other states and territories."

State and federal governments are trying to maintain unity over keeping schools open, a difficult situation when there are three sectors, and in one of those, the independent sector, each school is individually run.

The major private schools in Sydney are sticking to government advice to keep schools open in the face of pressure from some parents. One head said only a handful of parents were lobbying for the school to shut, but they were very vocal.

Kambala, PLC Croydon, Pymble Ladies College and Moriah College have all announced they are bringing learning online. Some will keep a skeleton staff on campus for students without supervision.

 [The Archbishop of Sydney stepped in]( on Wednesday morning to stop the entire NSW Catholic system from closing, ordering the state's 11 dioceses to follow government advice and stay open. 

Health authorities say there is little benefit to closing schools at this stage, and substantial risk the virus will spread further if children are sent out into the community.

They also warn of massive economic repercussions.

 [Not Satire] Greg Hunt: No, school will remain open. Closure letter is fake. Every state supports me. Health minister warns of fake Victorian school closures letter

Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt has warned parents of a forged letter circulating on social media, which purports to be from himself and his Victorian counterpart, Jenny Mikakos.

"This letter is a fake and falsely asserts school closures," Mr Hunt tweeted on Monday morning. "Schools remain open with the unanimous support of the States and Commonwealth. The matter is being reported to the police."

 2 million downloaded the app - how do they know? Google Play shows 100k+ downloads, including people who have downloaded more than once. Does that mean 20x as many downloaded on iPhone? I don't see any advantage in Google massively under reporting or delaying download numbers - quite the opposite in fact. So where is the download count coming from?

 Hunter schools enforce social distancing as teacher is exposed 

&gt;A NEWCASTLE Grammar School teacher has self-isolated after their friend was found to have COVID-19.

&gt;Head of School Erica Thomas wrote to parents on Sunday to tell them the year six teacher had come into contact with a confirmed case. The school is following NSW Health advice.

&gt;Ms Thomas told the Newcastle Herald the teacher was in Sydney last week with friends, including one who was confirmed on Saturday to have COVID-19.

&gt;"The teacher had contact with students and staff last week and had no idea he had come into contact with the virus the weekend before," Ms Thomas said.


&gt;"The teacher continues to exhibit no symptoms.

&gt;"We have cleaned all areas the teacher was in thoroughly, communicated directly with parents of the students he was most in contact with, phoned any parent where we knew the child or parent might because of other health complications be concerned, and informed staff."

&gt;Schools across the Hunter - including Newcastle Grammar - started rolling out social distancing measures on Monday, such as staggering break times and cancelling a range of events, from assemblies to sports carnivals, excursions, parent teacher interviews, Harmony Day and Easter hat parades.

&gt;"The school in the modern era has never dealt with a health crisis of this magnitude"," Ms Thomas said.

&gt;"As a community we need to protect those that are most at risk - while younger people seem to be less impacted if they contract the virus - we don't want to be responsible for passing it on to their grandparents."

The practicality of social distancing in a school setting and the question of school closures aside: community transmission in this context is a thing that we don't seem to be taking seriously enough at all.  Or in any context really.

 NSW schools should be closing down.. There is a large number of children packed into a single school throughout New South Wales, and this isn't a good thing when you can have anyone infected.

 Can someone answer this question about asymptotic carriers? Can someone answer this:

If child A gets the virus from their parents and hangs out with child B, and Child B goes home back to their family with the virus - does the virus magically disappear or does the family that interact with child B get the virus?

 Genuinely asking the question...If children are not considered “super spreaders” and are encouraged to go back to school by the PM, why are they still subject to social distancing measures? If they’re not high risk of contracting or spreading the disease, shouldn’t they be allowed to go to the beach, hang out at the mall and visit their grandparents? To be clear I’m not advocating these activities for kids, but trying to make sense of back-to-school vs home-iso. Link to Qld gov official advice below. 

Text taken from 

“Are children ‘super-spreaders’ of the coronavirus?
While we all know kids, especially younger ones, are not great at keeping their hands and bodily fluids to themselves at the best of times, there is so far no evidence to suggest they are so-called super-spreaders of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (COVID-19). Some asymptomatic (showing no signs or symptoms) infections have occurred in children but it’s too early to say how often this occurs. However, almost all the reported infections in children have been traced to an adult in the same household. This suggests that children have been infected by close prolonged contact with adults and not by contact with other children.
While it’s important to note there is still some uncertainty around the role children play in the transmission of COVID-19, it is most likely that children, with mostly mild or asymptomatic infections are not very effective spreaders of the virus. Of course, this risk can be reduced even further with careful attention to hand hygiene and cleaning, particularly in children who may have symptoms.”

 Covid legislation - Removal of children. Can anyone clarify when this would be used. Is it only referring to children in custody of the state? Example: foster home or any child in any dwelling? What right does this take away from the parent.
