 Could warmer weather slow SARS-CoV-2? (tl;dr) For the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, we have reason to expect that like other betacoronaviruses, it may transmit somewhat more efficiently in winter than summer, though we don’t know the mechanism(s) responsible. The size of the change is expected to be modest, and not enough to stop transmission on its own.

 Help scientists understand mental health impacts of self-isolation/quarantine Hi everyone, I am a psychology researcher at the University of Western Australia (UWA), we are conducting a major online study on the mental health impacts of self-isolation/quarantine in Australia (see more in attached recent coverage in The West Australian).

We are looking for people to share their first-hand experiences of self-isolation/quarantine, in order to fast-track the development of interventions that could help the most vulnerable members of our communities safeguard their mental health during COVID-19.

If you are currently in/about to begin self-isolation/quarantine, please consider helping others by signing-up to the [CARE Study](

This study involves daily questionnaires across the duration of your self-isolation period. Each daily surveys take less than 5 minutes, while the initial 2 surveys (registration &amp; baseline) take 15 minutes (bit longer, but extremely important as it captures your unique individual circumstance).

Please visit [CARE Study]( for more info. Any questions please feel free to email me at [carestudy@uwa.edu.au](mailto:carestudy@uwa.edu.au)

Thank you!

 Why doesn’t Australia shut the borders? Only allow Australian citizens and immediate family of Australian citizens in via highly monitored screening process and if they’re arriving from high infection area they are put into forced quarantine in specified locations. 

NOT self quarantine. 


The government won’t do this due to the economic impact but it’s stupid because the economic impact of a huge spread in Australia would be significantly worse. 

We are in a unique position of being on an island let’s use it to our advantage.

 Corona Virus shifts power from Commonwealth to States It seems to me that the Corona crisis has shifted power significantly back to the states. Since WWII power has been shifting remorselessly to the Commonwealth, primarily due to their taxing power.

At the moment, the states are doing all the heavy lifting and control all of the important portfolios for Corona Virus containment - Health, Police and security services, Education, borders (between the states), ensuring the food supply.

The Commonwealth has had to ensure sufficient money to provide those services and to prop up the economy, but they've effectively had no choice. Prior to the current crisis they would always extract a quid-pro-quo for any additional spending by the states. Now they're just handing the money out. They've given up saying there is no money and on their balance-the-budget rhetoric.

Immigration is now a non-issue. The Border Force performance has been less than brilliant. Foreign affairs is all but stalled as countries look to their own internal issues. Trade has diminished significantly. The Defence force's role is now to do what the states say.

Scott Morrison is trying to stay in control but, if it suits them, the Premiers just go their own way. His creation of the National Cabinet looks like an effort to make his government relevant. 

Who knows if it will continue, but for now, I'd say there's a significant shift in the balance of power back to the states.

 WorkSafe can stop a Victorian third wave From [the Strayan](

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The basic systems breakdowns that caused Victoria’s hotel quarantine industrial disaster have not been rectified and have been repeated again in the latest northern suburbs outbreak.  
&gt;  
&gt;As a result, this time, a major part of the blame for the business losses and personal tragedies resulting from the outbreak sits squarely on WorkSafe.  
&gt;  
&gt;Victoria maybe lucky and be able to contain this outbreak but the systems breakdown means there is a grave danger of a third wave.   
&gt;  
&gt;And, as I will explain below, Worksafe’s failure to act is enabling the anarchist movement and professional protesters to start harnessing the protesters.  
&gt;  
&gt;In theory, the Labor politicians outside the inner group could act but they are frozen with fear.  
&gt;  
&gt;WorkSafe has the power to fix the management systems failures by recommending the prosecution of ministers and public servants as is required by the Occupational Health and Safety Act.   
&gt;  
&gt;An alarmed Prime Minister now understands the crisis Victoria faces because its government and public servants have embraced systems that don’t work.  
&gt;  
&gt;In a carefully worded statement partly directed at WorkSafe, Scott Morrison said: “This is a profound disappointment. Victoria’s public health systems are either up to the task of dealing with future outbreaks or they are not.  
&gt;  
&gt;“The decision to keep businesses closed suggests that there is still not sufficient confidence within the government that their systems can support reopening.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Former Labor premier Steve Bracks devised Victoria’s excellent occupational health and safety rules for exactly this situation: a breakdown in systems causing death or substantial community harm.   
&gt;  
&gt;Self-Employed Australia has requested that WorkSafe recommend prosecutions but that petition gives the organisation until December 29 to act. The nation can’t wait that long. Under the Bracks rules WorkSafe has to prosecute people who use dangerous and faulty systems. Any failure to do so is endangering the nation and Victoria as well as causing huge losses. It may trigger of loss if life.  
&gt;  
&gt;Mission failure  
&gt;  
&gt;Victoria abandoned cabinet responsibility in the crisis and set up a unique “mission” system, which completely failed and led to the deaths of hundreds of people.  
&gt;  
&gt;Considerable improvement was later made in contact tracing and testing but the basic flawed systems remain and caused this latest outbreak to become very dangerous.  
&gt;  
&gt;A Somali family with three children became infected. Each member of the family had a case manager and there was also an interpreter. But, as we saw in the hotel quarantine systems breakdown the government employees were not trained to work together and communicate. The interpreter was not used properly.  
&gt;  
&gt;The family actually tried hard and went to the school for advice. But public servants in the education OHS wing didn’t know how to co-ordinate with the case managers: exactly the same systems break down that occurred in the hotels.  
&gt;  
&gt;An infected boy went to school and naturally the outbreak spread in exactly the same way as the hotels. The government puts blame in the Islamic community instead of itself.  
&gt;  
&gt;WorkSafe chief Colin Radford was a press secretary to Steve Bracks and if he feels that his mateship with politicians and public servants prevents him from recommending prosecution then he should stand aside.   
&gt;  
&gt;Yet because of his involvement with the excellent Bracks occupation health and safety legislation he is well placed to do his job. It is not easy to prosecute ministers and senior public servants but Bracks made sure they were covered by the legislation.  
&gt;  
&gt;But unless prosecution action is taken, the Victorian government will not embrace cabinet responsibility like the rest of the nation and in accordance with its disaster plan. Only when prosecutions start will the Victorian government fix its broken systems.  
&gt;  
&gt;The legislation states: “It is an offence under the OHS Act (s23) to fail to ensure that persons other than employees are not exposed to risks to their health and safety arising from the conduct of the employer.”  
&gt;  
&gt;And elsewhere: “If the body corporate commits an OH&amp;S offence and the contravention can be attributed to a failure by any officer of the body corporate to take reasonable care, the officer is also guilty of an offence.”  
&gt;  
&gt;It will not be easy for Bracks to advise Radford but he set the legislation up for exactly this sort of situation.  
&gt;  
&gt;Had there been a major disaster where private enterprise systems broke down prosecution would have been swift so that the accident could not be repeated again and again.  
&gt;  
&gt;Victorians now hope that the latest outbreak can be contained. But there is a new danger. The fury of the small enterprises that have been ravaged by the continued systems breakdown has been harnessed by anarchist and professional protest groups.  
&gt;  
&gt;The next set of protests will be massive and will be professionally organised. And because people will not be wearing masks they will most certainly create a third wave of infection devastating Victoria and the nation.  
&gt;  
&gt;Only one man can stop this happening — Colin Radford.  
&gt;  
&gt;Please Mr Radford do the job that you are required to do. It will not be pleasant but nation and the state of Victoria depends on you.

 Question: What if we isolated one state (region) and eased restrictions there as a test? Does anyone think that's not better than all states doing something different?  

With a lot of different restriction easing its very hard to get an idea of the actual impact.

If you ease restrictions in just one state (or region) and it gets substantially more cases than others then its pretty clear.

If all states ease to different level and the cases go up it could be just that we're heading into winter or something, and we would not have a clear measure of the restrictions.

Which state?   and why?

 VIC Gov: Supporting Families: Free Kinder &amp; More Out Of Hours Care *10 November 2020*

\--

This year, parents – but mostly mums – have had to juggle work and childcare and kids learning from home. Even now with students back at kinder and school, we know that balancing act isn’t any easier.

We want to give families one less thing to worry about.

**It’s why the Andrews Labor Government will deliver free kinder for 2021 and support for more outside school hours care – saving parents thousands of dollars and helping more women back into work.**

The *Victorian Budget 2020/21* will deliver up to $169.6 million to make kinder free next year, saving families around $2000 for every child enrolled in a participating funded kindergarten program.

The investment will not only make sure more kids are getting a great early childhood education, it’ll make it easier for parents – particularly women – to return to the workforce as we recover from this pandemic.

Under this investment, subsidies will be offered to early childhood services providing funded kindergarten programs – meaning free kinder for four-year-olds and eligible three-year-olds attending a participating sessional kinder.

Families with children enrolled in kinder programs at a long day care centre will also benefit from a saving of around $2000 in fees.

And for those families that have kids attending unfunded three-year-old programs in sessional kindergartens, there will also be reduced fees.

This investment builds on the Labor Government’s commitment to deliver kinder for every three-year-old, reaching every part of the State by 2022. 

To further help parents return to work or increase their hours, the Government will invest $81.6 million to increase the availability of before and after school care.

Grants of up to $75,000 will be made available to start new outside school hours care programs at up to 400 government schools – so that any school that currently doesn’t have a program can apply to receive a grant. 

This investment will mean more families can rely on before and after school care – giving parents greater flexibility when it comes to work, study, training or re-entering the workforce.

The funding will help establish new services across our state and provide support for costs including equipment, setup and administration, facility upgrades and transport.

Not only will these investments support our kids, they’ll help make sure families – and our state – can begin to recover from this pandemic.    

**Quotes attributable to Premier Daniel Andrews**

&gt;*“Women have been hardest hit by this pandemic. Real recovery means making sure they’re supported back into work – and the security and stability that affords.”*  
&gt;  
&gt;*“This investment is dedicated to making* *the daily juggle of work, school and kinder just that little bit easier.”*

**Quote attributable to Minister for Early Childhood Ingrid Stitt**

&gt;*“This is a smart investment. Not only will free kinder save families thousands of dollars – it’ll get more kids into kinder, back early childhood services and workers, and help support more parents, especially women, into the workforce.”*

**Quote attributable to Minister for Education James Merlino**

&gt;*“More schools will be able to establish before and after school care programs for students, giving parents greater flexibility when it comes to work, study, training or finding new opportunities.”*

 Australia to help Pacific countries prepare for coronavirus outbreak   [ 

The Australian Government says it will help move more essential medical equipment to Pacific countries to aid them in preparation for COVID-19.

There are currently 153 confirmed cases in the Pacific, mostly in Guam, French Polynesia and New Caledonia.

But there are grave concerns about countries like Papua New Guinea's ability to handle even a mild outbreak.

With borders closed, it's facing logistical challenges that Minister for the Pacific and International Development Alex Hawke says Australia will help with, in collaboration with partners like the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat.

A formal announcement is expected within days.

"Australia facilitates a huge amount of movement of goods and people through the Pacific," Minister Hawke told the ABC's Pacific Beat.

"We're a transit country, we've got the capacity to move goods and people in many ways that other countries don't".

The Minister defended the speed of the government's assistance to regional neighbours during the global COVID-19 pandemic.

The Pacific is also expecting a cyclone that's formed between Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea, and will approach Vanuatu in coming days.

Papua New Guinea is to remain in a state of emergency for two months, with restrictions on movement within the country ease and international borders closed.

Both the Opposition Labor and the Greens Party have called for the Government to step up its response and commit more aid to the region, which already has under-resourced health systems.

"The Minister needs to ensure and provide evidence that there will be targeted extra support for our Pacific neighbours during this crisis and beyond," the Greens spokesperson for International Development Dr Mehreen Faruqi said.

"Our aid budget shouldn't fall victim COVID-19."

Minister Hawke said that Australia is already "repurposing any aid funding that is available for the Pacific into immediate relief in terms of health matters and COVID matters and I think you can see that trend continuing".

He also confirmed that there would be no further cuts to aid when the budget is handed down, which has been postponed from May to October after the Government announced stimulus measures worth more than $AUD200 billion to help Australians and the national economy.

 PM Media Release: Tasmanian Tourism Boost *07 Nov 2020*

*Prime Minister, Minister for Infrastructure Transport and Regional Development, Minister for Home Affairs, Assistant Minister for Regional Tourism*

More than 130 direct flights from New Zealand to Hobart packed with tourists are set to sample the tastes and sights of Tasmania, under a deal struck by the Morrison and Gutwein Governments for Hobart airport to take around 30,000 international travellers each year.

The new arrangement will see the Morrison Government invest $49.2 million for around 30 Australian Border Force, Australian Federal Police investigators and biosecurity officers to make Hobart airport an international gateway for three flights a week from New Zealand and two flights a week in winter.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the new arrangement realised the vision set out in the Hobart City Deal and would be a significant jobs boost.

“Safely opening to Australia and New Zealand will be a shot in the arm for Tassie tourism and jobs,” the Prime Minister said.

“This has been an incredibly tough year for Australians and particularly our tourism and hospitality sectors, but this deal will mean tourists from low-risk areas can come to sample Tasmania’s incredible experiences, sights and produce.

“While the pandemic might have set back the timetable for making Hobart an international airport, it is just going to mean more pent up demand for the best Tasmania has to offer.”

Tasmanian Premier Peter Gutwein said his government would invest $10 million, as part of a $17.5 million investment in partnership with the Airport’s owners, to upgrade Hobart Airport’s infrastructure to facilitate its international border arrangements.

“For the first time in more than two decades Tasmania will welcome international flights from New Zealand,” the Premier said.

“This is a unique opportunity to travel between two extraordinary island destinations, and a terrific boost for local jobs across our tourism sector, including more jobs at our Airport as we undertake upgrades in the coming weeks to accommodate international arrangements.

“2020 has been a challenging year, but this is a sensational coup, and I invite New Zealanders to come to Tasmania and discover what makes this place so very special.”

Mr Gutwein said that he recognised the aviation industry was battling the impacts of the pandemic, and the Tasmanian Government would help underwrite the services between Auckland and Hobart for two years.

Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack said the airline and tourism industries had been smashed by COVID-19 and that the deal offered hope to businesses and workers.

“More planes in the sky means more jobs on the ground for Tasmania,” the Deputy Prime Minister said.

“This deal is going to see more tourists at Tasmania’s museums and galleries, staying at its hotels, eating and drinking at its restaurants and cafes, and exploring its parks and sights.”

Minister for Home Affairs Peter Dutton said the deployment of officers to process and oversee international arrivals would help keep Australians safe.

“As well as the risks we’re facing with the pandemic the other threats we face at our borders haven’t gone away which is why these highly skilled officers will be so important,” Minister Dutton said.

“While keeping our borders secure, the extra 30 officers flying in and out also mean more investment for local businesses.”

Assistant Minister Jonno Duniam said New Zealand was a critical visitor market for Australia and Tasmania.

“For too long Tasmania has been compared with New Zealand, and now Tassie has the chance to prove that one island is better than two,” Assistant Minister Duniam said.

“This is the shot in the arm that Tasmania’s tourism operators desperately need as they start rebuilding an industry that is stronger than it was before.

“Importantly, this is a giant leap towards Tasmania having a truly international airport, and gives the state an opportunity to prove it can be done with success.”

The Morrison and Gutwein Governments expect the new arrangement to commence in January 2021 and will be reviewed at the end of the first year.

 Victoria 'Lets open' campaign launched across all major newspapers this morning by Small Business Australia Three elements to what they are asking.

Publicly releasing ALL health data behind the Victorian government’s “no choice” strategy

Independently demonstrating the capacity of the Victorian health system to deal with a 3rd wave

Independently demonstrating that best practice technologies are being used in quarantine, isolation, tracing and treatment

Full text from 

 Small Business Australia has today launched the most important campaign in the history of our state, the campaign to save the over 600,000 small businesses and the 1.3 million jobs they create for Victoria.

For this campaign to be successful, we need your help and ask that you take the below 2 steps to generate the change we need in this State to get Victoria open:

Join the ‘Let’s Be Open’ movement by providing your email here:

Speak your voice so that the members of Parliament understand the impact lockdown and the government’s chaotic approach to combatting COVID-19 is having on you, family and friends

We will provide you with a ‘Let’s Be Open Citizen Action Plan’ via email, containing direct contact details, so you can be heard by the media and individual politicians that directly influence the government.

Your voice is critical, without you we cannot generate the change we need and to remind those that lead this State that they are elected representatives of the people, not dictators.

By joining the Let’s be Open movement you will ensure that the forgotten hardworking small business owners of Victoria and their employees, who despite their contribution to our state and community, find themselves at risk of failing at the hand of the unfair and harsh lockdown policies of the Victorian government.

With your help, we can give these business owners and employees a voice that is heard across Spring Street and through the corridors of power.

Together we can bring sensible change to the operation of the government that will rebuild the trust that underpins confidence. With confidence we can quickly have a future of keeping well as we live with COVID, buying local from each other and attracting back the investors, entrepreneurs, visitors and events we need for our State to thrive.

We can restore the trust in leadership essential for a functioning community and society and through ensuring that the Victorian government is ‘Open’with the people by:

Publicly releasing ALL health data behind the Victorian government’s “no choice” strategy

Independently demonstrating the capacity of the Victorian health system to deal with a 3rd wave

Independently demonstrating that best practice technologies are being used in quarantine, isolation, tracing and treatment

The government spin of “trust us” and “we know what is best for you” is not enough for the people of Victoria and together we will demand that the government shows trust in the Victorian people by:

Sharing all the information with the people – not hiding it

For the “loss of memory” on any facts that may expose government failures to come to an end

For the policy of shutdown to be replaced by the policy of ‘Let’s Be Open’

Millions of Victorian’s ask themselves every day what they can do to be heard by those in power to enact policies that will see the State open and helping all Victorians to confidently rebuild their lives, businesses and communities?

Today you can join us in holding the government to account and to get our State open for business.

Today you can be part of the Let’s Be Open campaign that will save our small businesses!

 If not us then who? If not now then when. Now is the time to realise that the Australian government cares only for its members and its profiteering associated.  The members governing this country have once again proven their ineptness and inability to do the one job they are paid (very well) to do. It’s time to realise-as a country that democratic government does not work for the majority of people.  We have an opportunity to implement change. Remove the power, money and greed hungry from positions of power and create a new form of government.  One that does not choose to be there making decisions.  But one that deserves and is called on to serve-for a limited term -as servants to the people to whose lives they will endeavour to improve with every decision.  If not us then who.  If not now then when.

 The economic cost of this lockdown is so unfairly split (rant) I feel like I am going to lose my home and the small business I have spent my life building so that people in QLD and WA can stand up in the pub. Even if I manage to hold on the ***best case*** scenario for me is that I lose a year's income.

I blame the lockdown in Victoria 100% on the border closures, which forced us to go for elimination rather than #flattenthecurve. The fact is if I was in any other country on the planet my business would still be making some money. If the whole country was open under NSW level of restrictions I would still be making some money. But because of Anastasia and Mark I have had zero revenue for most of the year.

And then I hear the federal government cutting support and individuals in other states act indignant at the idea of kicking in anything to help Victorians pay for the policies that they forced us in to.

I just feel so betrayed by my fellow Australians. I feel like I am going to be bitter about this for the rest of my life. Whenever there is a flood in QLD or a bushfire in NSW we all come together to help, support is substantial to the Australians who need it and nobody is complaining about sharing the cost, so why is this different? Small business owners like me are being asked to potentially sacrifice everything for the greater good while others give so little and even complain about that.
++++++++++
 Remember the bushfires? The government's slow response to the bushfires allowed them to grow into the tragedy we went through earlier this year.  Social distancing and isolating is our way of helping put out this COVID fire.  So many Australians are still going about their lives like this doesn't exist, so instead of being firefighters they are out there setting more fires.

I hope this analogy can get through to at least a few people who are still out in pubs.

Take care of yourselves.

 CORONAVIRUS UPDATE PLEASE READ AND COMMENT The PM announced a major development: A Human Biosecurity Emergency has been declared which gives the government a whole new set of powers.

Please read the following and go through the legislation I’ve cited. 

I hope a discussion will shed light on what the future holds for us.

&amp;#x200B;

1. On Wednesday March 18th Scott Morrison announced that the National Security Committee (NSC) has declared a “human biosecurity emergency” in accordance with the *Biosecurity Act 2015*. (1)
2. The NSC is “the peak decision-making body for national security…matters in the Australian Government. It is a committee of the Cabinet of Australia though **decisions of the NSC do not require the endorsement of the Cabinet itself.”** (2)
3. The *Biosecurity Act 2015* “is about managing diseases…that may cause harm to (human health)” and can be found in full on this website: [
4. Chapter 8, Part 2 of the act relates to human biosecurity emergencies. Section 476 specifies that the Health Minister may extend the emergency period for as long as they are satisfied it is necessary (see SECT 476(1) and 476(3)). Basically the Health Minister is solely in charge here. He does not require Cabinet or Parliament approval at this stage.

5 As you’re about to discover, he can issue any requirements that he is “satisfied” are necessary to “protect human health”. Here are the relevant sections….

**BIOSECURITY ACT 2015 (NO. 61, 2015) - SECT 477**

**Health Minister may determine emergency requirements during human biosecurity emergency period**

During a human biosecurity emergency period, the Health Minister may determine any requirement that he or she is satisfied is necessary to prevent or control the entry of the disease into Australian or the spread of disease in Australia or to prevent the spread to another country. The Legislative Instruments Act 2003 **does not apply** to the determination. These requirements may include but are not limited to restrictions or preventions of movement of people and goods or evacuations. Any decisions remain in place until the emergency period has ended. A person who fails to comply with a requirement may commit an offence.

**6** **SECT 478**

**Health Minister may give directions during human biosecurity emergency period**

The minister may give any direction, to any person, that he believes necessary to prevent or control the spread of disease, including (but not limited to) directing people to close or prevent access to a premises. Refusal to comply is an offence.

7 Failure to comply with requirements under sections 477 or 478 can result in 5 years prison or a $50,000 fine. In the real world it might not come to all that, but you can definitely be arrested and charged.

8 When you put the three relevant sections together, it appears that the Health Minister can order almost unrestricted requirements of the Australian people as long as the emergency is declared, and the emergency can be extended as many times as the Health Minister decides.

9 Other issues outlined in the Act include

\- Powers to enter, search and take samples from premises.

\- Requirements to provide body samples

\- Requirements to provide information

\- Powers to “accompany” children and “incapable” people without *first* notifying the parents or caregivers

\- Powers to seize or destroy goods

\- Requirements for people to receive a vaccine, treatment or medication

\- Forced isolation

I did summarise the information in the ACT as sections of acts can be long and difficult to read due their formatting. I want everyone to be able to understand and contribute. If you follow the link at the end of this paragraph you will find copy of the act that is easy to navigate, is well divided, and has a clickable contents page. [

 Minister for Health: Our thanks to the staff of the National Incident Centre after a year of continuous operation # Our thanks to the staff of the National Incident Centre after a year of continuous operation

*8th November 2020*

**The Hon Greg Hunt MP**  
Minister for Health

\--

For the first time in its history, Australia’s National Incident Centre has been activated continuously for more than one year to respond to unprecedented health emergencies.

For the first time in its history, Australia’s National Incident Centre (NIC) has been activated continuously for more than one year, working across Government to respond to unprecedented health emergencies faced by Australia and the world.

The NIC was activated in November 2019 in response to a measles outbreak in Samoa, and continued to act during the 2019–20 bushfires, the Whakaari Island volcano eruption and, most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic.

From December 2019 and into January 2020, the NIC was concurrently managing three different situations, also for the first time ever.

I want to thank all of the extraordinarily talented, dedicated and hardworking staff of the National Incident Centre over the past year. Led by the Department of Health, the staff have been drawn from across Government, including the ADF.

Their work around the clock allowed Australia to maintain an air bridge for critical and scarce global supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) and test kits at a time of international shortage. The NIC has literally been the Operations Headquarters for Australia’s national response to the pandemic. 

Never has the National Incident Centre been more important, and its worth is shown in the Medical Journal of Australia’s paper, which attributes the saving of 16,000 lives to the comprehensive and early nature of Australia’s response. 

The staff of the NIC have embodied the concept of real and profound public service. We are fortunate to have had such a well-prepared and well-drilled centre as the NIC in place before the pandemic. We are even more fortunate to have such an extraordinarily capable and dedicated team to help save lives and protect lives across Australia.

As the Department of Health’s emergency operations centre, the NIC coordinates Australia's health emergency response to national and international incidents. It is also the primary means of communication between the World Health Organization and Australia for public health events, including the COVID-19 pandemic.

 A significant accomplishment was distributing millions of masks and other PPE from the National Medical Stockpile in response to the bushfires and COVID-19 to states and territories, aged care facilities, disability service providers and Primary Health Networks.

As part of the COVID-19 response, key staff from a range of agencies across the APS were seconded to help operate the NIC. At its peak, the NIC engaged more than 200 employees, including liaison officers from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Australian Border Force and the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. Surge staff have included epidemiologists and analysts from the Department of Defence, the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment and the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare.

The NIC has also engaged in public information, community awareness and communications. The Australian Government has the strongest commitment to informing the community about the latest health advice and developments. This includes a national campaign, website, fact sheets, media liaison and social media.

The NIC was first formally activated for the SARS outbreak of 2003. It has since been activated for a range of emergencies including the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004, the Bali bombings of 2005, the H1N1 Pandemic in 2009, the Victorian bushfires of 2009, and the Christchurch earthquake of 2011.

I thank the hardworking public servants in the NIC, which will remain activated for as long as this national health emergency demands.

 Has anyone actually been hired by the government? With so many people losing their jobs, Scovid keeps saying “the government is hiring”. I just wanted to know if anyone has actually been hired by the government since being let go by their employee due to the Coronavirus? 

I find it very hard to believe that the government would actually hire additional staff when they are saying “stay home” and causing so many people to lose their jobs. I have absolutely no faith in our government looking after the Australian people.

 Are we panicking too much, or too little? This question is inspired by this article: [\#UnityOverFear: Asian-Australian leaders start petition to fight coronavirus-fuelled racism](

Also, [The Sensible Centre]( claims that the entrenched interests in the major parties are using COVID-19 to impose a panic on society to distract from their policy failures:

* [
* [
* [

[Personally, I used to think it was right for the government and media to try to stop panic, while my brother was already extremely concerned early on and extremely critical of the government and media for trying to prevent panic]( But when the pandemic exploded in South Korea, I realised just how bad the pandemic really was, and I realised the panic was justified. 

Part of the reason I used to be supportive of the government and media efforts to stop panic is because I used to worry that I, as an Asian-Australian myself (even though I moved here at age 5 and I have integrated into Australian society), would be scapegoated and attacked because of the pandemic. As it turns out, I am not getting scapegoated and attacked, therefore, I am not as worried about panic anymore.

Should I be worried about the panic being excessive and leading to anti-Asian pogroms? Or, [considering how many people are using this pandemic as an excuse to take a holiday,]( are we not panicking enough?

We are in a strict lockdown because the Victorian government are incapable of controlling the spread of Coronavirus. They are arrogant, they lie, they mislead and they shift blame to anyone but themselves. Why do people still blindly follow this government - 

DA supporters it would be great to hear your opinion on the below

  
**Did Daniel Andrews lie about federal government support being on offer?** Andrew Crisp requested 850 ADF personnel. This was 'cancelled' the following day.  

**Why has he not been transparent to the people of victoria over the data and modelling used to keep us under the worlds longest long down? T**he data has been manipulated to support his rhetoric, it was dated and only took into account certain scenarios. 

**The curfew was not a direction of the CHO but simply to make policing easier?**

**Is this really the only possible way to do this as he claims?** Why does he not to listen to countless medical professionals providing other solutions to this lockdown but rely on his government for this who have already proven their incompetence?

**Why was he unable to put contact tracing in place?** NSW has had to step in. Years of underfunding to the hospital systems - Up until very recently the majority was still paper-based with no source of truth!!!

**Why will he not allow small businesses to reopen?** \- What is the difference between council gardeners who can still work and an individual gardener going to someone's house with no human contact? It is completely illogical and lacks any medical backing.

**Is the roadmap achievable?** 0 cases for 14 days is the eradication of the virus yet he insists this is not their strategy. He has so little faith in his own government and the people of Victoria the only way he can deal with this is to lock everyone up regardless of the consequences. 

**Have independent bodies actually had conversations with the government?** Medical professionals, businesses, economists, all say that conversations with the government have been one way, yet Andrews denies this - Despite providing evidence, or strategies to operate completely COVID safe, they have been denied.

**He has still not announced support for businesses or individuals affected by COVID?** Will he be able to see as prior to COVID the VIctorian economy was already pretty beat, and since his lockdowns, he's tripled the state's debt.

This is just COVID but we would be here until the end of lockdown if we discussed the systemic failures of the Government over the last 2 terms.

 Government action for community benefit Here's a thought.
For years calls to ban smoking have been blocked because individual choice trumps the health and well-being of hundreds of thousands of people and the associated burden it places on the healthcare system.
Now we are told individual choice and freedom of movement must be sacrificed because of the health and well-being of hundreds of thousands of people and the associated burden on the healthcare system.
The same contrast can be made with regard effective environmental regulation and it's potential toll on the economy.

 rent and the government How can retail leaseholders who have in effect been closed due to government movement restrictions challenge the government giving the landlords 50% of their earnings and retail leaseholders nothing in comparison to, in my case 50% of $94,000 yearly rent.

 PM Media Release: Tasmania to help more Australians return home *07 Nov 2020*

*Prime Minister, Minister for Foreign Affairs*

The Australian and Tasmanian Governments have agreed to provide an additional 450 spaces in quarantine facilities in Hobart hotels to help more Australians return home from abroad.

The Tasmanian Government has indicated it would increase its quarantine capacity spaces if it can confirm additional hotel contracts, which will then make it possible for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, in partnership with Qantas, to arrange facilitated commercial flights to help Australians return home.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the additional capacity was on top of the 6,315 weekly quarantine spaces currently agreed to by states and territories.

“We’re working every option to help as many Australians return home as quickly as possible,” the Prime Minister said.

“We thank Premier Gutwein and his government for their willingness to help us tackle the challenges our friends and family are facing overseas amidst the pandemic.”

The Commonwealth is continuing to work with state and territory authorities to further increase the quarantine capacity they can offer, as well as further facilitated flights.

Tasmanian Premier Peter Gutwein said Tasmania was pleased to support the national effort to help Australians in need.

“Tasmania will never turn its back on its fellow Australians, and as I have said for some time, we stand ready to play our role to help bring Australians home,” the Premier said.

“This is being achieved in a COVID-safe way for returning Australians and Tasmanians, with all inbound passengers required to be tested prior to travel, and will need to return a negative COVID-19 test on or after day 10 of their quarantine period before entering our community.

“This deal also means supporting our hotel industry which has seen a significant downturn in bookings this year.”

Minister for Foreign Affairs Marise Payne said DFAT officials would work with Qantas to ensure the most vulnerable Australians registered are given priority access to these flights.

“Our focus is on helping Australians who want and need to return,” Minister Payne said.

“More than 411,000 Australians have returned since 13 March and around 30,600 have been assisted by the Australian Government including on 66 directly facilitated flights.”

The Government continues to assist vulnerable Australians overseas through consular assistance and through the Hardship Program. Financial assistance is available to help cover the costs of flights where other sources of finance have been exhausted.

More than 7,000 Australians of the 26,200 registered with DFAT on 18 September have returned since, including around a quarter who were considered vulnerable.

We continue to encourage Australians trying to return to Australia from overseas to register with DFAT through the nearest embassy or high commission or via Smartraveller.

The Government is underwriting the cost of the flights, and airfares will be available at commercial rates to passengers, with loans through DFAT available to those who need assistance.

More details on the flights will be available on [smartraveller.gov.au]( and [qantas.com](

 NSW Gov: $120 million extra for free preschool program to help parents *09 November 2020*  
\--

# The NSW Government has announced a $120 million funding commitment for community and mobile preschools in 2021.

Families and young children in NSW will benefit from an extra year of free preschool with the NSW Government announcing funding for community and mobile preschools in 2021.

Premier Gladys Berejiklian joined Treasurer Dominic Perrottet and Minister for Education and Early Childhood Learning Sarah Mitchell to announce the $120 million commitment, which will help more than 44,000 three to five-year-olds attending community preschool.

Ms Berejiklian said the free preschool program has been supporting families since the beginning of the pandemic and this funding would provide certainty for parents into the future and help ease hip pocket pressure.

&gt;“Support for families and children has been a priority for this Government during the pandemic and I’m committed to see it continue while we recover,” Ms Berejiklian said.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Initially announced early in our COVID-19 response, the free preschool program has supported countless jobs, and kept children learning and engaged during some of their most important years.”

Mr Perrottet said the funding would provide up to 15 hours of free care per child each week and would allow many parents to continue working and supports them to divert family income into other essentials.

&gt;“This is a $120 million investment in our future, which will remove a layer of financial pressure for many families during this uncertain time. It will also help support more than 7,400 early childhood educators and teachers in their vital roles,” Mr Perrottet said.  
&gt;  
&gt;“This could save families more than $2000 per-year per-child and will ease cost of living pressures and help balance work and family life.”

Ms Mitchell said even during the toughest times childrens’ education was the top priority.

&gt;“Early childhood education is so important, especially in those critical two years before school,” said Ms Mitchell.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Families will have certainty moving into 2021, knowing that regardless of their situation their child will be able to continue with their preschool education.”

This funding will be made available to approximately 700 State-funded community preschools and 38 mobile preschool services that provide care for over 44,000 three to five year olds in the critical years before school.

 AFR reveals vic restrictions from draft obtained. Construction sites, manufacturing plants, car dealerships and the majority of retail stores are set to be closed under the stage four restrictions poised to devastate the Victorian economy.

A draft document obtained by The Australian Financial Review sets out the huge numbers of businesses set to be shut from midnight Monday and the select few allowed to remain open as the Premier Daniel Andrews ramps up efforts to control the coronavirus outbreak.

Under the classifications in the document there are only three types of construction that will be allowed to continue: residential construction that is already underway, construction of critical infrastructure and infrastructure connected to essential services.

Workers at the Laverton North warehouse on Monday. Examples of construction sites that will be closed for business are residential building sites yet to open, non-residential building construction, heavy and civil engineering projects.

The new classifications also orders the majority of the state's retailers to bring the shutters down with car dealerships, furniture stores, retail hardware stores, electrical goods stores, department stores, florists, clothing stores, antique stores, food courts, auction houses and sex shops to close.

Retailers allowed to remain open include supermarkets, grocery shops, service stations, pharmacists, post offices, drive-through agricultural retailers and hardware stores that cater to permitted services or industries.

The document also puts a number of wholesale businesses into the column of businesses to be closed including motor vehicle sales, motor vehicle parts retailers, furniture, floor covering and other homeware wholesalers. Wholesalers that can remain open include grocery, liquor and tobacco businesses and wholesalers of cereal grains.

Under the new restrictions, businesses wanting to continue operating will need to seek a special exemption from Victoria's chief health officer.

Manufacturers of goods that "would, if not exempted, otherwise permanently close and create a major supply chain gap" or be "critical to global supply chains in the local and international manufacture of essential products overseas, such as medical equipment and supplies" will be exempted. So will businesses trading as sole operators.

Mining support services and exploration in Victoria will also be required to close with exemptions for coal, oil, gas, metal ore, petroleum, non-metallic mineral mining and quarrying.

For the financial services industry, only retail banking and the provision of banking services to those unable to access online services will be permitted. Financing, investing, insurance funds, superannuation funds and auxiliary finance and insurance services will be forced to close.

It is understood the finance industry was seeking greater clarity from the Victorian State Government on its interpretation of retail banking and the provision of retail banking services, after a similar ban in New Zealand saw some contractors such as security staff who oversee the maintenance of ATMs stopped at road blocks.

In the telecommunications and media sector book publishers, directory businesses, mailing list and software publishers are required to close while telecommunication services, newspaper production, radio and television braodcasting will be allowed to continue.
