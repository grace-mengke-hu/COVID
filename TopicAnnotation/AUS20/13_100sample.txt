 South Australia records 1 new interstate case A South Australian man, in his 40s, was granted an exemption to travel to and from Victoria as an essential worker. He tested negative on July 10, but later tested positive on July 22.

Chief Public Health Officer Professor Nicola Spurrier says the man has been in quarantine during the infectious period. However, Spurrier says there is a chance the man‚Äôs family, who he has been at home with, could have contracted the virus. The entire family and close contacts are now self-isolating.

The new case is the third confirmed in the past 48 hours after two women, in their 50s and 30s, tested positive on Wednesday. 

The woman in her 50s had recently returned to Australia from Pakistan. She had two negative results in Melbourne while in hotel quarantine, but subsequently tested positive 12 days after she arrived in South Australia on July 9. Spurrier says the woman had been in quarantine the entire time and was completely asymptomatic. She will remain in isolation for another 10 days as a precaution.

The second case is a woman in her 30s who had been quarantining in Adelaide after arriving from Mumbai on a repatriation flight on June 27. She also had two negative tests while in hotel quarantine, but had a family member who tested positive. A recent serology test revealed the woman was infected but, due to the time frame, her case is not considered active.

The state‚Äôs total now sits at 447 with two active cases.

 SA records 0 new local cases üç© # New cases reported in the last 24 hours

* **0** new cases were recorded for the last 24 hours
* **1** previous case added to the total number of cases in SA:
   * SA Chief Public Health Officer: "We have just done a thorough routine audit and because we have been so  busy with the Parafield cluster, we didn't add a case to our list and it was an international traveller. So it hasn't been previously publicly reported and I would like to give  you those details. This case was an overseas arrival he came in on the 15 November. She was in a medi-hotel of the time when we have the  positive case result. So we put  everything in place when we needed to put in place for this particular person and she has had all of the  essential medical follow-up. The  reason that case was omitted was  because you might recall because of the Parafield cluster, we changed  our cut-off time because we wanted to get people in South Australia all of the latest information so we were reporting cases to the public more immediately rather than looking at the 24-hour cut of time. So she is not at all linked to the cluster and has since been cleared of the virus and has now left the medi-hotel. But that is just for completeness."

 Analysing total/active cases for each LGA (Tableau dashboards) As a learning project I've scraped the DHHS to obtain a record of the COVID data at the LGA level, and put them into some accessible visuals:

The [Graph of cases (total/active) over time]( allows users to pick specific LGAs and examine how their total/current case levels have changed over time.

The [Interactive map]( allows users to examine different LGAs on a map to see where they are, and examine total cases/new cases in the past 24 hours. By clicking on an entry in the table, the corresponding area on the map will be highlighted (and vice versa).

I'll try to update each as soon as the data becomes available (when the DHHS media report comes out).

Happy to answer any questions about the process or the data!

**02/11 - Regis Macleod aged care facility update**:

&gt;Regis Aged Care can confirm that the results for residents and staff tested on Sunday 1 November at Regis Macleod in Melbourne have all returned as negative for COVID-19. We are currently waiting on the remaining staff results, where tests were taken off site.

While we wait for these results, Regis is in discussions with the Department of Health and Human Services regarding the next phase of managing the outbreak. Including a two week phase of enhanced surveillance where visitation is still limited but residents can move freely through the Home socialising with other residents.

Regis staff members previously furloughed will return to the Home next week. Our staff members who contracted COVID-19 are recovering and we are in regular contact to ensure they receive the support they need.

Notes: doubling time in days have been smoothed with 7 days (geometric) moving average

The number of cases in Australia was obtained from this wikipedia page

[

the growth and doubling time was calculated. Growth is easy to calculate, just dividing today's number with yesterday's number. Doubling time was calculated by taking the geometric seven day moving average of growth and then converting the result to doubling time.

Example: doubling time for 2020-03-10 is

log(2) / ( (log(1.16) + log(1.1) + log(1.15) + log(1.22) + log(1.13) + log(1.23) + log(1.27))/7 ) = 4.2169

In addition to the above data, NSW Health posts up to date public health alerts when new detections of COVID-19 viral fragments are detected:

* ‚ö†Ô∏è Testing of Moss Vale sewage samples taken on 19 November identified fragments of the virus that causes COVID-19. While the fragments may be from identified cases in the area, NSW Health reminds the community to come forward for testing should they develop any symptoms.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Fragments COVID-19 have been detected in samples taken on Tuesday 17 November from Batemans Bay sewage system. While this may be explained by a previous case who is no longer infectious, as a precaution, **NSW Health is calling on people in the Batemans Bay area to get tested if they have even the mildest COVID-19 symptoms.**

‚ÄãNSW Health is alerting the public to new locations visited by confirmed cases of COVID-19.

**One confirmed case attended Ripples restaurant in Milson‚Äôs Point on Saturday 3 October from 8pm to 10.30pm.**

While contact tracing is now well underway, NSW Health can advise the details of **a small number of walk-in diners in the restaurant during this time were not recorded.**

**All diners who were in this restaurant at that time are considered close contacts and must immediately get tested and isolate for 14 days since they were there, and stay isolated for the entire period, even if a negative test result is received.**

NSW Health tonight also advises anyone who attended the **Mazda Artarmon repair centre on Campbell Street between 7.30am and 9.30am¬†on Friday¬†2 October are considered casual contacts and should immediately isolate and get tested if they develop the slightest symptoms of COVID-19.**

* With the growing number of outbreaks, these posts were getting way too long and messy. Therefore, we‚Äôve decided to move the current outbreak list to Google sheets - you can find it [**here**](  
After the DHHS publishes their media release, a summary of the affected/new outbreaks for the day will be posted on these daily case updates, like above. For further information including a link to the source, you‚Äôll need to access the Google sheets.

 Daily Tests/Positive Ratio and 14day best case, 9th Sept Daily 0.46% positivity ratio, 76 cases on 16686 Test results   
14 Day Avg: 0.53%, 84 Cases, 16492 Tests 

&amp;#x200B;



Current 14d thresholds are currently 50 and 5.  
For 50 cases, the earliest we can reach this is 14th Sept, assuming no new cases from now (one day later than yesterday). This step is currently driven by the date (28th Sept).  
For 5 cases, the earliest we can reach this is 22nd Sept, assuming no new cases from now (one day later than yesterday). This step is currently driven by the date (26th Oct).

Note: I do this on the actual new cases / the number of reported tests. Some other places do it on the 'net new' cases. I prefer this way, as this is the daily snapshot. This way will give slightly higher ratios. It's important you, the reader, understand what the difference is. A positivity ratio of 1% does not imply that 1% of the wider population is infected - the tests are not of a random sample of the population.

How can they simultaneously be in quarantine but also at the shops???

 NSW Health: Public health alert - new venues 28 October 2020

NSW Health is alerting the public that a confirmed case of COVID-19, who will be included in tomorrow‚Äôs numbers, has attended venues in Sydney‚Äôs south-west and east.

Anyone who attended the following venues for at least an hour at these times is considered a close contact and must get tested immediately and isolate for a full 14 days from exposure regardless of the result:

* Flip Out Prestons Indoor Trampoline Park, Unit B/238 Hoxton Park Road, Prestons on Sunday 25 October 2020, between 12pm ‚Äì 1.50pm
* Jasmins Lebanese Restaurant, 375 Macquarie Street, Liverpool, on Sunday 25 October 2020, between 2pm ‚Äì 3.30pm

Anyone who attended the following venues is considered a casual contact and must monitor for symptoms and get tested immediately if they develop. After testing, they must remain in isolation until a negative test result is received:

* Westfield Bondi Junction, 500 Oxford Street, Bondi Junction, Saturday 24 October 2020, between 1.30pm ‚Äì 4.30pm¬†
* Watsup Brothers kebab shop, 149 Eldridge Road, Condell Park, on Saturday 24 October 2020, between 5.30pm ‚Äì 6pm¬†

* Marketplace, Kurrajong Road, Carnes Hill, on Tuesday 27 October 2020, between 3.30pm ‚Äì 4.30pm,/li&gt;

Testing numbers have dropped recently, which is a concern. NSW Health is appealing to the community to come forward for testing right away if you have even the mildest of symptoms like a runny nose or scratchy throat, cough, fever or other symptoms that could be COVID-19.

I recently came in contact with someone that more than likely has COVID19 (they were in close contact with a confirmed case and now have "flu-like symptoms"), and since learning about this I have been searching Reddit for a community focused on self-treatment and prevention.

 More than 100 nurses and paramedics are undergoing refresher courses to come back to work and help the Victorian health system cope with the coronavirus epidemic, state Health Minister Jenny Mikakos says.  

Fresh from an hour-long meeting the the Australian Medical Association and nurses‚Äô and paramedics‚Äô unions, Ms Mikakos said the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation had put the call out to nurses who had not recently worked in the profession to ‚Äúcome back on the tools‚Äù.

‚ÄúThat call-out has already resulted in more than a hundred nurses who will be picking up to do refresher training and get the practising certificates that they need so that they can assist us in that important task,‚Äù Ms Mikakos said.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm also very grateful to the Victorian ambulance union, who has put a similar call out to retired paramedics, and they too have had a significant increase in retired paramedics who have contacted them, and they too will be prepared to go back onto the tools, to go back into the ambulance vehicles and assist Victorians in their time of need.

‚ÄúI would encouraged any other healthcare worker who has retired, who hasn‚Äôt been practising for some time to assist us in these challenging times.

‚ÄúThey can contact their union as the first point of contact. They will then contact us and we‚Äôll be sharing that information with health services, because we want to ensure, of course, that we have coverage across the entire state and particularly make sure that the needs of rural and regional Victoria are addressed as well.‚Äù

 Almost one third of returned travellers in hotel quarantine refusing COVID-19 tests &gt;**Almost one third of returned travellers in hotel quarantine refusing COVID-19 tests**

&gt;*By Aisha Dow*

&gt;Almost one third of people living in Victoria‚Äôs quarantine hotels are refusing testing, the state's Deputy Chief Health Officer has revealed.

&gt;In response to a question this morning, Deputy Chief Health Officer Annaliese van Diemen said about 30 per cent of returned international travellers were not agreeing to the tests.

&gt;This likely means a number of coronavirus cases are missing from official Victorian and national tallies.

&gt;‚ÄúAt the moment, there is not a requirement that they must undertake testing,‚Äù Dr van Diemen said.

&gt;‚ÄúEveryone is offered testing on multiple occasions throughout their stay.‚Äù

&gt;Of the 30 new cases detected in Victoria, five are in hotel quarantine.

#Protester diagnosed with virus did not have COVIDSafe app

The protester who tested positive for COVID-19 after Melbourne‚Äôs weekend rally did not have the COVIDSafe app, Deputy Chief Health Officer Dr Annaliese van Diemen has revealed.

‚ÄúIt would have been useful certainly,‚Äù Dr van Diemen said.

Health Minister Jenny Mikakos refused calls to release the identity or photo of the protester who has tested positive warning doing so might discourage people coming forward to get tested for COVID-19.

‚ÄúIt would be a breach of the Health Records Act for this individual to be named in these circumstances,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúObviously, we were very clear in our advice last week that we did not want people to attend the protest. We made it very clear that there was a public health risk for people attending any mass gathering event, regardless of the cause, regardless of the level of passion that people have about an issue.

‚ÄúBut having thousands of people come together was something that was incredibly, inherently risky. So if people now are exhibiting symptoms, when they would urge them to go forward and to get tested.‚Äù

 My close calls with COVID this week and how Vic DHHS has handled them My family has had a couple of close COVID calls this week, one of which is still ongoing - so I thought I would provide my experience dealing with these - particularly given the comments being made by Daniel Andrews in relation to people not doing the right thing.

**My partner was identified as a close contact of a positive case at their medical clinic in Victoria**

*20 July 2020*

* Upon arriving at work my partner received a notification from her workplace (verbal only) that they had been identified as a close contact of a recently positive case and was directed to get tested immediately and not return to work until results were known.
* They were told they did not need to isolate as they did not show any symptoms - following the guidance of DHHS.
* Regardless, they returned home immediately after testing and both of our children were removed from care within 25 minutes of me being alerted to this situation and we all came home to wait for test results.

*21 July 2020*

* Received notification late in the afternoon that they were negative and were clear to return to work.
* Under guidance from DHHS, the Clinic was told they did not need to close for a period of deep cleaning and for all staff to isolate until results were known. They were back at work the next day with absolutely zero contact from DHHS, everything was done through their workplace.

**A positive case was identified in a staff member at my child's school**

*23 July 2020*

* The evening after collecting my child from on-site learning we received an email from the School that informed us there had been a positive case at the School and it would be closed for all students currently learning onsite from 24th July 2020 until further notice. This closure would allow time for the school and the DHHS to work through a contact and containment strategy.
* Told to sit tight by the Principal and await confirmation from DHHS if your child was identified as a close contact, they would be in touch.
* Anywhere from 40-60 contacts would be likely at this School, given the number of essential workers in the area who had children that were attending.

*24 July 2020*

* Received another email from the School that said the following:*By closing the school for these 6 days, we are aiming to minimise any further spread of the virus in our school community. This time will allow infectious cleaning of the school site to occur on the recommendation of the DHHS and the CECV. The school and the DHHS are continuing to work through a contact and containment strategy. As you can appreciate with the large numbers of positive cases occurring in Victoria the DHHS have been swamped.*
* 42 hours have passed and DHHS have not yet finalised a contact tracing strategy when a large number of children may have been exposed - we haven't received any guidance of whether we need to isolate on the chance that my child is carrying the virus but is asymptomatic or yet to develop any symptoms and we have not been instructed to get them tested.
* There would be a number of families in exactly the same situation as us, and after speaking with them their experience is largely the same.

Just thought I would share this to highlight what I would perceive as an incredibly poor job being done by DHHS in responding to the pandemic.

in frustration I reached out a reporter for The Age who took this information and published it on their live blog **yesterday** and we are still awaiting a contact from DHHS or an update on the School that contact tracing has commenced.

**The DHHS are also yet to publish that either the medical clinic or the School have had positive cases at any point this week. As far as the public knows, there is absolutely no issue at either of these institutions.**

 Does anyone have any idea of when Victoria may be moving into ‚ÄòCOVID normal‚Äô restrictions? Is there a criteria (number of case free days) or rough date that has been given? :)
++++++++++
 Controversial: With Vic cases increasing rapidly - should NSW look into a 'pre-cautionary' lockdown? The situation VIC has shown us that suppression via testing and home isolation is not working. It is a lagging approach. With a virus that takes up to 2 weeks (or more) to surface - we should look into revising our approach.

* Suggestion: Given many Victorians have moved to NSW (understandably), would it not be it wise to be one step ahead of the virus and initiate a pre-cautionary 2 week lockdown or at least raise restrictions in NSW?
* If cases rise - we would have prevent unnecessary death and suffering
* If no cases rise - we can remove the lockdown

Alternatively - We can continue to play catch up and pray cases do not balloon. Given we have remove almost all our restrictions, I do not believe this is wise.

Forest fire analogy:

* NSW is dry terrain - easily ignited as we have removed all fire safety controls
* VIC is on fire - with evidence that it is spreading to NSW
* We have a small window to do a controlled burn - should we do it or pray the the fire does not approach us?

 A friend and I are doing some ‚Äòisolation math‚Äô, re percentages of AUS, USA and UK confirmed cases. Do these numbers mean we are accelerating as quickly as USA? We‚Äôre wondering how (or if) to interpret the numbers. 

Australia: 

Population: 24,511,800 (2017, Google)

Confirmed cases: 547 (BunkerJohn, Imgur)

Percentage: 0.0022% 

USA: 

Population: 328,239,523 (2019, Google) 

Confirmed cases: 9,009 (BunkerJohn, Imgur) 

Percentage: 0.0027% 

UK:

Population: 67,545,757 (2019, Google) 

Confirmed cases: 2,457 (BunkerJohn, Imgur) 

Percentage: 0.0036% 

Especially with Australia and USA, it looks like it‚Äôs progressing at roughly the same relative speed? That‚Äôs a difference of 155 people - 155 people more in Australia and it would be exactly at USA‚Äôs percentage. 

Confirmed cases source: [here](

Are these numbers relevant or worth looking at? Morrison keeps saying we‚Äôre in a great position because we have fewer numbers, but he‚Äôs looking at actual numbers, not the percentage of people it‚Äôs reached. 

Or do these numbers mean nothing? I am not math-minded so I don‚Äôt mind being told I‚Äôm wasting my time (plenty of it to waste at the moment though!) or I‚Äôm plain wrong with the math/applying the math to the real world here.

Thanks friends

 [NSW] Public health alert ‚Äì Jetstar flight JQ510   
02 October 2020

NSW Health is contacting passengers and crew on a flight from Melbourne to Sydney who may have been exposed to an infectious passenger.

The passenger, reported today as a returned traveller from Victoria, is a confirmed case of COVID-19 in hotel quarantine. This traveller tested positive to a Day 2 test in hotel quarantine and is believed to have travelled while infectious.

There is no ongoing risk of infection to the general public.

The majority of passengers on the Jetstar Flight JQ510 which left Melbourne at 11am on 27 September are already undertaking mandatory hotel quarantine.

NSW is contacting 47 passengers travelling with special permits or quarantine exemptions or crew. Those deemed close contacts of the case have been advised to immediately get tested and isolate for 14 days and stay isolated for the entire period, even if a negative test result is received.‚Äã

 Here are some of the testing statistics for Australia, for those who didn't know we were tracking them :) &amp;#x200B;



Where the testing numbers are approximate, we have calculated based upon that approximate number. Population for each state is based on data from the [Australian Bureau of Statistics.]( 

We keep these alongside our [case tracker]( in our sticky posts. Case tracker is updated throughout the day, and the testing stats are updated at the end of each day.
