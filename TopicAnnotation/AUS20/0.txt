 Opinion/discussion: what is essential??? What is essential in people's opinions and when it comes to the restrictions?
Are fast food restaurants (drive thru) essential? Is a Kmart/target essential? Is a bunnings or an IKEA essential? Are clothing stores essential? What about a jb-hi-fi or good guys?

I work in a telco retail store, everything we do on a store level can be done over the phone or live chat (adding some days for shipping) but my area manager has just let us all know we are essential to stay open. 

Is anyone else's jobs claiming they are essential but you can't figure out why?
