 Australia's Covid-19 Death Toll Is Now 5.  [

&gt;A 90-year-old woman died on Saturday and testing confirmed that she had COVID-19, NSW Health said in a statement on Sunday night.  
&gt;  
&gt;She was a resident of the Dorothy Henderson Lodge aged care home, where two other residents have died after becoming infected with the virus.  
&gt;

&gt;She developed symptoms on the plane, was taken to hospital and died the same day.  
&gt;  
&gt;NSW Health discovered the woman had contracted coronavirus and informed Queensland Health on Sunday, the spokesman said.

 Coles / Woolworths and suppliers are price gouging! Itâ€™s quite disappointing to walk the isles of the major supermarkets to see almost no special tickets anymore.  The FMCG and produce suppliers who fund many of these specials have pulled their planned specials. 

As a result the aggregate cost of groceries has become significantly more expensive in a time when incomes are declining and unemployment is rising.  I have personally moved to Aldi where possible to stem this noticeable increase to my grocery bill, but where is the ACCC in all this!?
