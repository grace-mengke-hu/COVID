 Police not interested. Who ya gonna call? My housemate works in an office in Melbourne. The organisation is not practicing distancing between desks in an open plan office.

The police have been called twice to address the situation (on the non-emergency number) by individual staff. Both times they were told that the police were annoyed and tired of being called out for such a petty reason, and they have better things to do.

My question is this: who DO you call? 

The situation at this workplace is very concerning

 Sydney family told only one child can go to Queensland to say goodbye to dying father 
++++++++++
 I'm so tired.... I apologise in advance for the wall of text.

I have husband and two kids. I also have a very overbearing father in law. He has always been very demanding of my husband's attention. He has done a lot of things over our marriage that have stepped over the line, which brings me to an issue that I have to vent about and get advice for...

My father in law always comes over and wants to talk to my husband (we're talking every second day, as well as, 4 to 5 phone calls a week). To get my husband's attention that he is outside our house, he throws the decorative pebbles that are outside at the window until he come out. Yes we have a doorbell, but he doesn't use it.

Since the Coronavirus pandemic has gained momentum from early in February, he has not decreased his visits, he has still turned up over 15 times in the last month. I have asked (and begged) my husband to ask his father to perhaps just call him instead of coming over. The reason being that we have small children and one of them is an asthmatic. I have also started to work from home to minimise exposure. 

My father in law's wife also works in a very high risk area and his step daughter works in a hospital. When he goes to the shops he also doesn't wear a mask nor wears gloves. He also constantly touches his face and rubs his nose with palms. I am terrified that he is going to infect my husband and thus in turn our kids.

My husband refuses to talk to his father about not coming over at the moment and tells me that they are far apart enough when they are outside.

We had a massive fight about it and my husband finally promised that he wouldn't go outside to talk to his dad for the foreseeable future, but talk to him over the phone. When his dad came the next day, he went outside to talk to him again.

Which brings me to today. His father turns up again. My husband didn't go outside, but spoke to him through the screen door. My father in law got closer and closer until he was about less than a metre away. He was there for about 15 mins. I went to see if my husband wanted lunch and I saw a letter on the floor under the screen door. I got Glen 20 and went and sprayed the letter on the floor. My father in law got the very irate yelled at me that he didn't have Coronavirus and called me a big whore (my husband is the only man that I have kissed and been with). My husband told his dad to calm down, but then my father in law left and told him that I was tearing the family apart and taking him away from his family.

My husband then reprimanded me and said why did I do that and that they were 2 adults having a conversation and I interrupted them and interfered and that I'm ruining his life by behaving this way.

I feel like I am going crazy. I know that I went over board with the Glen 20, but I constantly feel like I'm not listened to and I'm so worried about my kids.

Am I out of line? Am I an awful person?

 Statement From The Victorian Premier - 25 March 2020 Last night, National Cabinet took another big step. I want to tell you why and let you know what we need you to do right now.

The Prime Minister and other first ministers recognised that Victoria is currently grappling with a more imminent threat than most other states – because we have more cases.

Because of this, we agreed states and territories will soon need to take individual measures – because this is moving at a different speed in different places.

I am pleased that National Cabinet has made that decision – and tonight we’ll discuss it further.

We said there would be a Stage 2 and that’s what we’re doing today. But I’ll be up front with you, there will also be a Stage 3.

We need more time to get our health system ready for what’s coming. Every country in the world that is running ahead of us would give anything to have had more time.

Last night, the Prime Minister went through the details of Stage 2 restrictions on non-essential venues and activities. In Victoria, those will begin at midnight tonight.

We don’t take these actions lightly but to put it bluntly: if we don’t slow this thing down, we won’t just have people waiting in line for Centrelink – we’ll have people waiting in line for machines to help them breathe.

I know this is stressful and I know this is scary.

The measures we already have in place are difficult, and these will be harder again.

I want to reassure you that things like supermarkets, petrol stations, banks, post offices and bottle shops – and a number of other essential services – will be staying open.

But I want to be very clear: the more people ignore the rules and ignore the advice – the more this virus will continue to spread.

There is no social occasion or celebration that’s worth more than a human life.

For Victorians that means if you can stay home, you must stay home.

We are all being asked to make sacrifices. Because if we don’t, people will die.

A full list of Stage 1 and 2 restrictions will be available at coronavirus.vic.gov.au. Businesses seeking advice about whether they are affected can also call the Business Victoria coronavirus hotline on 13 22 15.

 This person here is why COVID will get worse. STUPIDITY kills 
++++++++++
 Assuming eradication, then what? So let's assume the next couple of months play out to plan and Australia and New Zealand eradicate community transmission. In the meantime covid is running rampant around the world, and other countries are merely trying to flatten the curve. So now we are one of the very few countries not heading towards herd immunity. Clearly we are putting all our eggs in the vaccine basket.

But what if the vaccine takes years, doesn't work, or has low uptake?

Is the plan really that A/NZ will cut itself off from the rest of the world forever? Or until they have heard immunity? But I can't see that working (e.g. measles, etc). And what if the virus mutates beyond the vaccine?

Should we actually hedge our bets and allow some sort of slow trickle of covid into the population?
++++++++++
 If You Wear a Mask, Please Wear It So You're Not Wasting It We have a shortage of surgical masks and P2 respirators, so if you're concerned for your own reasons and feel the need to wear one, please let it do its best to protect you. 

A lot of people are promoting masks on this sub, and there are certainly people with legitimate concerns including working in a supermarket while living with a severely immunocompromised person. My aim isn't to tell you whether you should or shouldn't buy and wear masks. I just want to get some people to hear this in the interests of reducing, to any degree, the number of masks that are being worn in ways that are not benefiting the wearer. 

COVID-19 is spread through droplet and contact transmission. Infection control, including transmission-based precautions, is more than just a mask you slap over your nose and mouth. It is a discipline that is taught to healthcare workers. If you're interested, these videos give you some insight into PPE (a part of transmission based precautions) and recommendations for its use with COVID-19:

 [ 

 [ 

The gist is that gloves, gowns, face shields/goggles, and masks work together to protect healthcare workers. That part's the PPE (with masks only one of the four), the discipline is in how and when to perform hand hygiene, how and when to don/doff PPE, and ensuring your PPE is intact while you are wearing it. 

Will masks alone help? Yes, probably, to some extent (also depends on the type of mask). If you wear them correctly. Obviously, masks alone are not as good at defending you against infection as the full rigmarole described in the videos for heathcare workers in close contact with COVID-19 patients.

**So if you wear a mask, please do:**

\-Wash your hands well before putting one on. Washing your hands well means a good scrubbing of all hand surfaces. Use hand sanitiser the same way if you can't wash your hands with soap and water. 

\-Put the mask on and make sure it fits as well as it can. If you have a P2 respirator, ensure there are no gaps between its edges and your face. 

\-Leave it on your face where you put it. 

\-Take it off when it gets damp from your own breath/anything else and discard. If not single-use, follow guidelines for cleaning it. 

\-Wash/sanitise your hands well directly after disposal. 

\-Wash your hands regularly regardless. If you are concerned about droplets getting into your airways, any droplets you encountered will be on your clothes/body/other surfaces as well as on your mask. 

**Please do not:**

\-Pull the mask down below your mouth, then later pull it back up. The outer surface of the mask, if contaminated, will likely have been touched by your hands, portions of your face, neck, and clothing, and the inside surface of the mask. This is no longer of benefit to you. 

\-Scratch your nose/mouth/face through the mask. This not only potentially contaminates your hands, which could go on to touch other things including your eyes, it could dampen the mask or the act of rubbing/scratching could force germs through it. 

\-Pull the mask off, lay it on a surface, then put it back on. Again, you want the inside to be the "safe zone" and to avoid the mask contaminating anything around it. 

\-Forget to wash/sanitise your hands before and after touching anything to do with your mask, your face, mucous membranes, or food/drink. 

\-Leave your nose uncovered or wear a poorly-fitting mask. 

\-Take the mask off incautiously so the outside touches other parts of you, including your eyes. 

If this is all common sense to you, then I apologise for not giving you anything new to learn. I am responding to the mistakes I've seen be made in the hopes people who have gotten themselves masks read this and do not make them. If you have made your own mask out of cloth, this still applies, though unfortunately the benefit of a cloth mask is unlikely to be as good as that of one produced for the purposes of infection control with a tested bacterial filtration efficiency (BFE).

 Why can’t we just work together? I work as a manager of a tree planting company West of Melbourne, I’m so lucky that We’ve been able to keep working and keep some staff on.

It hurt a lot to let a few of my team go, they’re casual workers and I know that they are struggling being at home without work.
They’re good people and don’t deserve to be treated lesser because we use labour-hire services to get trees planted. I lost sleep over thinking about them.

On the other hand I’ve got some Full-time staff who were begging to be off work, to “take a vacation like the rest”. Even got some staff spewing conspiracy theories and false information...

 Some perspective for all these pro-lockdowners On July 30th, Victoria reported 723 cases. 

NSW, with a bigger population, had fewer cases than that since July 30th, *in total*. 

Yet NSW never went into lockdown. Businesses stayed open. Schools stayed open. People weren't put on a curfew. Families weren't kept apart. 

What NSW did was to mass test, tightly manage its hotel quarantine, and *very rapidly* trace and isolate the contacts of identified cases and inform the community. It is what every *competent* government does to manage Covid-19. 

Sure, such behind-the-scenes contact tracing work is boring. It does not let a politician wag their finger at people for doing the wrong thing. It does not allow them the power trip to put millions of adults practically into house arrest. But it is what keeps the streets open, communities functioning and families together. 

Now, as we finally move forward, remember to look back and see what we suffered - yet which noone else in Australia had to suffer. Not because they are naturally immune to Covid or anything. Only because their government bothered to do the "boring" stuff, rather than just empty chest thumping at a presser. 

And do not let people who think lockdowns are the only way to manage Covid ever make you forget this. Their choices prevented you from living these past few months normally, like everyone else in Australia did.
++++++++++
 Thinking out loud - what if we are all depleting our natural immunities by using all these face masks &amp; hand sanitisers. Won’t that increase our mortality rates with every other bug we come into contact with??? A friend posted this on FB last night. How true is it?

 Rural Victorians in Stage 3. What is the attitude like in your area? Our LGA had a 4 person outbreak in the week prior to the new lockdown announcement. During the first lockdown our towns turned into ghost-towns with the occasional 'tourist' coming to raid our supermarkets. We even had a couple of bus loads told to turn around before getting here. This time it feels like it's 'business as usual, just wear a mask'.

I'm wondering if it's just us or everywhere is behaving so nonchalantly despite some places having confirmed infections.

 Schools need to close  

I teach over 200 kids a day (sometimes more) in a school of about 1000 (wow, that's over 500). Now, this is just my little rant about the issue of keeping public schools open and by no means is it actually guided by scientific studies. It is purely my opinion and there could many flaws and no one might even read this. However, I feel that teachers have little say and we all feel the fear of speaking out (but thank you teacher's federation for your efforts).

The arguments about keeping schools open are just plain dumb. Schools aren't just made up of children, there are teachers, cleaners, general assistants and office staff and more. Ask any of us and we will tell you that a school is the perfect place to spread germs (the flu gets spread at least once a year in a school; no it's not scientific, it's just based on experience).

Now the government's main issue for keeping schools open is that it's safer?

\- Children will run around and spread covid-19 to the public by hanging out in big groups at the park and shopping centres? How is that any different to before and after school? Do we not trust that our children and parents of the children to keep them at home as if they were at school? Are they rabid animals who hang around in gangs of 30 and terrorise everyone around them with the threat of viruses by coughing and sneezing on people?

\- They need supervision/ parents can't all stay home to look after them. Well Sherlock, some parents are at home already and some have been sent home. Schools should be left open for kids who have no other options (no parents /no access to technology/HSC related work that needs face to face instruction or the like). Not only does this cut down on numbers, it means that any kid walking around in public should be at home or at school just like any other school day. This isn't a holiday. This is a lockdown.

\- Children don't apparate into school. They walk or take public transport. Some travel a fair distance. Just because a kid is at school, doesn't mean that they're never out in public. Kids dominate public transport before and after school (I apologise to the public in advance) and now we've increased the number of people who are in the line of exposure. Well done.

\- Big companies such as CBA, Telstra, Macquarie, NBN, Tabcorp and many more, have sent their non-essential staff to work from home because they understand that it reduces the chances of spreading. They haven’t closed nor have they continued at 100% load. Why can’t schools do the same??? No more than 500 people in a gathering (haha, have you been in a public school before?). What a joke.

Now I know that there are some parents who are wanting their kids at school and there are definitely parents who aren't able to stay home to look after young children. However, this is a pandemic. We are trying to limit the numbers of people catching this NOT BECAUSE THEY WILL DIE but because THEY WILL SPREAD IT. Schools should stay open for only the absolutely essential kids with no face to face teaching but just supervision for them to do their work and otherwise, there needs to be arrangements made for kids to not be in large class groups (1.5metres apart. Ha. Good one. Have you met children? Have you seen schools?)

Tl;dr Schools are over 500 people. Close them.

 Your opinion on letting foreigners into the country Hey guys,

I’m a German guy whose SO happens to be from Australia. Prior to COVID we were living here together, but when things started shutting down we deemed it best for her to return to Australia.

My plan was to head to Australia for year to see if I could imagine settling down there for the future. With the travel ban, this option no longer exists.

What I am curious about is your guys’ perception of how your government is handling the situation and what your outlook on opening up the borders for long-stay visitors (i.e. me) is.

Here in Germany things are largely open again, travel within the EU is possible and there is a list of countries (incl Australia) that people are allowed to enter from. The criteria is essentially that the case numbers need to be comparable to the numbers in Europe. We have about 1000 new cases/day being reported in Germany.

To me it is interesting that Australia seems to be interested in “isolating” itself. Of course no one is aided if “outsiders” bring new cases into the country, however with appropriate testing and quarantine measures, do you think the current hurdles to entering the country are appropriate?

Don’t mean to offend anyone, just want to pick your brains a bit :)

 Coronavirus interactive map lets you view worldwide cases, deaths and recoveries. &amp;#x200B;

Hey everyone. Since we are all stuck at home, I thought I would post about this [interactive coronavirus map]( I really like it because you can just fly around the map and see how each country is doing. To view statistics you just click on markers on the map.

You can view statistics for a few cities in Australia. Sadly international coverage is better though.

Also, they have a little sidebar on the left so you can view statistics like recoveries, deaths and confirmed cases for each country. They also have a little graph representing exponential growth for the infections of COVID-19.

However, one thing I dislike is that sometimes the map gets a bit challenging to read as sometimes the "dark theme" of the map makes it a bit challenging to know where you are at.

But nevertheless, its still a great map to play around with and for getting quick information on the go.

Cheers everyone. Stay home, save lives.

 Requests to die surge as virus fears push terminally ill to make plans Doctors say they are seeing a surge of terminally ill people asking to end their lives at home amid fears the coronavirus crisis could thwart their hopes for a swift, painless death surrounded by loved ones.

Figures obtained by The Age show more than 300 applications have been lodged by terminally ill Victorians since the state's landmark euthanasia laws came into force last year.

While it remains unclear how many of those applications have been successful, the figure is more than double the 135 people who applied for permits and were deemed eligible between June 19 and December last year.

Fifty-two Victorians suffering a terminal illness died using the laws in their first six months, far surpassing preliminary estimates of just 12 people in the first year.

At the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia, Melbourne oncologist Cameron McLaren, received as many as four calls a week from terminally people wanting to obtain a permit for a cocktail of government-endorsed lethal drugs.

COVID-19 was not a driver behind patients opting for euthanasia but Dr McLaren said the virus had fuelled anxiety around dying and had been a catalyst for some terminally ill patients to use the laws earlier than they might have done to ensure they could have the death of their own choosing.

"I saw three patients on the same day at one point," Dr McLaren said. "These are patients who were always going to go down that path anyway. Coronavirus has spurred them to take steps earlier to be organised and prepared."

Some terminally ill patients wanted to avoid dying in hospitals, fearful the virus could mean they may be separated from their family.

In April, The Age reported 53-year-old woman, Gill Rayson, who had terminal lung cancer, died in an isolation ward at the Frankston Hospital overlooking a dumpster, awaiting a coronavirus test.

Ms Rayson's children were allowed just five minutes to say goodbye to her, while her mother was banned from the ward. The test came back negative after her death.

"That story brought home the challenges hospital face," Dr McLaren said. "In the weeks following we had an increase in patients asking questions about assisted dying."

To date, Dr McLaren has helped about 60 people apply for permits to die. All of them have been in intolerable pain, with most bedridden. Twenty-seven have died so far using the legislation.

St Kilda GP Nick Carr, who sits on the board of Dying With Dignity Victoria, has also observed a rise in interest from patients.

"There has certainly been more active interest in assisted dying," Dr Carr said. "I have had a small number of extra referrals for patients getting on with the process for fear something might happen and they could be separated from their family."

The laws allow access to a lethal substance for terminally ill adults who have only about six months to live – or no longer than 12 months for those with a neurodegenerative diagnosis – and who meet other strict eligibility criteria such as being able to give informed consent.

Most people will drink the dose – a lethal powder mixed with about 30 millilitres of a liquid medication – in their own homes at a time of their choosing.

Those too ill and physically incapable of swallowing will be allowed to take the substance through an intravenous drip set up by a doctor.

Euthanasia advocate Rodney Syme said the process of obtaining a permit to die can still take "weeks or months" so making an application to access the laws early was "sensible".

He stressed most people may never need to take lethal dose.

"It simply gives them a sense of control," Dr Syme said. "It is there if they need it and if their circumstances become absolutely unacceptable and their suffering is too much they can end their lives peacefully."

Under the laws, two doctors, including an expert in the person's disease, must conduct favourable assessments of a person's eligibility. Doctors have the right to object to taking part in the scheme.

A person has to make three separate requests to end their life after initiating the process themselves.

The Voluntary Assisted Dying Review Board, which assesses every application, will release its next report in July, which will reveal the number of people who have taken their own life using the laws in the first year.

The state government would not comment on the data obtained by The Age, in keeping with Health Minister Jenny Mikakos' determination not to offer a "running commentary" on the progress of assisted dying.

 Did anyone else see a lot of police checking restrictions around Melbourne yesterday? After hearing a siren outside my house, I saw police walking around the suburban park near my house yesterday, checking that people were socially distancing. That's never happened before. A friend's mum was pulled over and questioned about where she was going during the restrictions, they even went through her phone (!). There was a roadblock checking every car on a nearby major road the previous day. News articles say 85,000 drivers have been stopped and questioned in the past week. 

My theory is that Andrews has police doing a blitz, especially this week, and if they have to fine enough people for breaching restrictions, it will be the pretext for Stage 4 restrictions being introduced. 

That's why yesterday's press conference was just Andrews and the senior police guy talking about people not following the rules. Andrews and Sutton also said repeatedly if people don't follow the lockdown they will have to introduce more restrictions.

Has anyone seen similar stuff? Thoughts?

 Lockdowns in stages? What is the purpose of implementing lockdowns over Stage 1, Stage 2 etc...???

The rationale seems to be: If Stage 1 is not enough then we need to introduce more measures 

Here is where I get confused. Looking at Italy and China, the success of their restrictions only become evident weeks after the measures are introduced, although Australia is increasing these Stages every few days. There doesn’t seem to be enough time to measure How successfull Stage 1 was before introducing stage 2.

 Will the new regional travel restrictions escalate to martial law? Hello everyone.

Our WA premier has just announced that there will be travel bans enforced across regions on Tuesday.

I live with my bf in Perth but my parents live deeper in the South West. I promised them that if society was looking like it was going under martial law, we would take refuge there.

My father is possibly immunocompromised due to being paraplegic and I would have to live with my grandparents who are obviously at risk. I feel extremely uncomfortable taking refuge here not only for my father and grandparents sake but also for potentially bringing the virus to their town as many old people live there. 

My parents think however that we are really silly for wanting to stay and self isolate, as they are worried that these travel restrictions are going to foreshadow rioting and desperation for food and then martial law, and since we live already in a dodgy area, they think we would be risking our lives if we don't move down there immediately. 

I'm really panicked. I'm 20 years old and have major anxiety already and I just don't know what to do. My bf thinks they are being a bit dramatic and he doesnt think people will start rioting as the supermarkets won't go completely scarce. I really don't know what to think and am seeking advice or informative articles, as they think I should research the history of martial law because history proves how this is gonna go down. 

Another option is that we could take refuge at my biological father's in Perth, as they have a car and live in a safer neighbourhood, but yet to hear about if we are allowed to do that from them as I've only just asked.

Please help, I'm really confused and upset and my parents want me to do research about martial law or hints that the gov is going to go that route afyer these lockdowns. [Here is the news article they sent me]( they are worried about the level of control and defence that the police and other unnamed co-opted organisations have with these new restrictions and enforcements. Thanks so much.

 Help please I'm confused and very anxious about this question and I was wondering if some one could please help me answer it. 
During stage 4 lockdown partners are allowed to see each other but due to stage 3 lockdown I wasn't able to get my driver's P's and my partner doesn't have a car. So is a parent allowed to drop me at my partner's (we are in out early to late 20s) or do I have to pay for an uber or public transport? Please help last lockdown I wasn't able to see my partner due to his living situation, and cause a great deal of emotional and mental stess. I'm sorry for any spelling I'm very nervous and can't concentrate well.

 If someone returns a positive, does that mean everyone they come into regular close contact with gets tested too? Title, I won’t go into details but I need to know this for personal reasons
++++++++++
 Does anyone have personal experience with contact tracing? Do they promise not to report you for unrelated crimes? I am sorry if this has been covered somewhere but I can't see it. I keep thinking that some percentage of people breaking lockdown and getting infected will have been doing something illegal or embarrassing, like cheating, seeing a sex worker, buying drugs, working illegally, even more serious crimes. Do the contact tracers guarantee you won't be reported to the police, immigration, family services, parole board? And that no one will tell your family/spouse etc?

I just feel like there is this idea that it's possible for humans to be fully perfect people when that's impossible. Every mystery case could just be someone who can't safely tell the truth for fear of consequences.  Even if they 'promise' not to tell, would migrant communities believe them? Hell, would I even believe them, with our new police state?

 Libs are calling for a royal commission into Vic's handling of the pandemic but how about royal commission into Murdoch Press crucifying our premier smack bang in the middle of it? The Victorian opposition is calling for a [royal commission into the handling of the pandemic in the State,](
 but how about royal commission into Murdoch Press crucifying our premier smack bang in the middle of it? 

I do think there should be an investigation but there already is one. Is it really that helpful when people are in the middle of fighting this thing to hammer them in the process? They were even going after his Mrs with her name trending on twitter the other night. 

A royal commission wouldn't just grill Andrews but every person involved in making this end. Surely Australia needs to get behind us here in Vic? It feels like the media is limited to criticism. Maybe it's just poor journalism?

Our numbers are going down, we are winning. It absolutely sucks but we are avoiding more yo-yoing AND saving the rest of Australia from this plague.

 An analogy that I've been working on re: tinfoilers vs the disaffected I was called out recently for calling people who are protesting the lockdown measures "tinfoilers". It wasn't exactly what I meant but that's how it was interpreted so I've been looking for a good way to describe it. This is what I've come up with.

&amp;#x200B;

Think of most of us as barrels, and our frustrations as gunpowder. Normal use of gunpowder is to take a portion of it, load it into the cannon, arm it (in this analogy with facts) aim it at an issue and fire for effect. This achieves some catharsis, some of those feeling are gone and we go on about our lives, hopefully the issue has been resolved.

At the moment however, our barrels are full. They're leaking gunpowder everywhere and we're not being given the opportunity to load those cannons and address the issues. 

Now, along come the actual tinfoilers. The kids who were never told "no" growing up, grew into adults with no boundaries. They love to sit at their keyboards and flick metaphorical matches out randomly just to see what happens. Maybe their match is homeopathy. Maybe it's 5G causes COVID. Maybe it's chiropracty, cupping or TCM. 

Pre-COVID, their match might have landed in a barrel, but with little powder in it, the damage is limited. They convince a parent to use pseudo-medicine and a child dies. The support gay conversion and screw up one or two lives. They convince a cancer patient that crystals will save them, and shave off a few months of their life, or potentially prevent remission. 

Now, however, they want us to congregate. To pack together, with our full barrels and lids off, so that they can flick their matches and wait for the bang. And maybe some of us have damp powder, so we don't go bang ourselves. We take it home and the smouldering core sets off a family member instead. Or several of them.

&amp;#x200B;

How do we stop this? Say no to these people. Be the parent they needed. Set healthy boundaries and enforce them and if necessary, cut them off.  Use some of your powder to take aim at the right targets: hysteria mongers, pseudoscience  quacks, narcissists and their ilk.

 Will I be allowed treatment? Hi all I have a question if anyone can chime in. I am a 18 year old citizen here with no recent travel history but I fear that I have developed the virus. I kinda have a lump in my throat it doesn't feel sore at all like something is stuck there, no runny nose and no fever but a weird feeling in my chest. The lump and chest thing have only come today but I have been constantly monitoring my health for the past couple days since it hiked here in Australia. The chest pain kinda feels like when you've heard bad news and your heart drops but it feels constant, like a shallow pain. I've had some issues with breathing 2 years ago before but it wasn't deemed serious and everything checked out medically. But these are like the 3 symptoms right? I cannot tell if it is or I am just constantly worrying about my health that I think I have it. Not to mention this situation has been quite stressful to juggle around school and home life. 

Anyways, I was wondering that if I did contract the virus and am developing it, would I be allowed treatment or even a test? I am hearing so much people are being turned away from tests and treatment or sent in circles of procedure that end nowhere. Also seeing/hearing that our gov isn't doing much in terms of mitigation and going BAU, it seems hopeless to even attempt to seek medical help because I feel like they will tell me to just self isolate, and wait for it to pass. Hearing that our healthcare system will also probably not be able to handle all the cases, will I most likely be left to fend for myself? Do we have to be in super critical condition to even qualify for being in the ICU or getting tested? Genuinely asking here and I am based in VIC if it's anything.

 People focus on Dan's Failings But Scomo is a Dog Seriously I get why people are mad at Dan and I for sure think they have blame in our second wave but how Scomo can get out of this without half the country thinking he is a giant piece of shit is beyond me. His constant trashing of Victoria, trying to get in with Clive Palmer to sue WA and harassment of Qld to open borders so NSW can have a holiday has put so much of the population offside. Add to that his pushing for a return of International students and travel to NZ when he isn't even willing to get Australians stuck overseas home I can't see how his position is even tenable anymore.

I'm still mad at him holidaying during the bushfires and at this point I can't see how anyone from VIC, QLD &amp; WA would even contemplate voting him back in. Sure the Murdoch media can portray him in a positive light but does anyone buy that anymore? People are calling for Dan's head but at least he is trying to get us back on track all the while dodging pot shots from Scomo trying to derail us.

Sorry for the rant but a Victorian here seriously sick of his shit.

 Differences between states This is not at all intended to drive a wedge between states, but I feel it could be helpful to talk about differences between states methods of approaching this and what works and what doesn't.
One thing that's utterly mind boggling to me as a NSW resident is recently learning that VIC still requires people to be symptomatic to get tested, that seems extremely counter productive to me, is it due to a shortage of tests?
As for NSW I personally feel we are way behind as far as locking down goes, but I'll also admit that I've been wrong at almost every step regarding this pandemic and NSW. 
It's gotten to the point where I have an odd level of trust in a government I despise, I feel they know a lot more than we are told as they have managed to somehow keep this thing from blowing up massively through every slip up....
Is it the contact tracing? Or was it just too far gone by the time VIC caught up to acting on it?
Again this isn't about which state is best, I feel for every single person stuck in Victoria and hope you guys can get through this (and that NSW doesn't explode too of course)

 Melbournian here. Just wanted to type out how i feel. Doesnt matter if you dont wanna read it just needed to type somewhere where people may understand. I dont watch the press confrences i find it easier to just catch up on a news site later on. As i read yesterday the road map for us i wasnt surprised really. We knew we were not going to be pleasently surprised. I did turn the tv on in the arvo with my cup of coffee i look forward to everyday after i wake up (yes in the arvo,what else is there to do? Im pregnant and tired so why not sleep).
And the press conference was on and i had this feeling again as i do when i think hard about the situation we are in and i still think "wow,im still not used to the pandemic but at the same time i cant really remember the feeling of a completly nornal life either". 

Im not here to type out where vic went wrong or why anyone thinks danial andrews sucks or anything like that im just feeling a bit miserable and would like this space to talk how i feel even though im just one out of many. Yes,im aware there is lifeline and beyond blue. 

Im feeling kind of numb but i just recently started up my anto depressants again so that could be why. Theres a comfort in knowing theres other people struggling too.
Knowing that its going to be a long road makes the struggle even harder. Theres not much good on tv, the masked singer ad said "australias favorite guessing game" and quite frankly i wish they didnt include me in that because i think its embaraasing show and who approves this shit?

I miss the gym bad,im a person who has always had self confidence issues and i got in great shape then the gyms closed and i got pregnant and its hard to tell whats pregnancy changes or if im just fucking fat!
You cant even get excited for whatever you have ordered online because it takes so friggin long to arrive that by the time its near,the excitment is gone.

All i do everyday is clean the house,washing and cook. Sometimes i go for a walk and sometimes i do some home body excersises but i never feel like its worth it as i was super into weight training at the gym. Its seriously everything to me.
Im feeling ugly. I feel like i dont trust anyone.

 Summary of Scott Morrison's press conference  

* An unprecedented, indefinite **level-four travel ban is in place for the entire world**. The travel advice for all Australians wanting to go overseas is "**Do Not Travel**".
* There is a **ban on non-essential indoor gatherings of 100 people or more**. Australians are still advised to stay away from non-essential outdoor gatherings of 500 or more.
* Modeled on Singapore's approach, the official advice is that **schools will remain open**.
* There are new measures in place for visiting elderly relatives in aged care. In end-of-life situations, facilities will have the discretion to put very strict arrangements in place to enable family members to see relatives.
* **Scott Morrison has urged hoarders to stop panic-buying**, as grocery stores deal with empty shelves.
* The chief medical officer has said **a shut down of the country is not recommended** by the experts

Falling into dementia and having got out of palliative care just last year it’s amazing he’s still here and has some wit about him but I know it’s not going to last and it’s killing me I won’t be there in his final months (someone as visited from my family everyday for the past 2 years). I could really do with some timeframes or an idea to get my head around this when I could maybe have the chance  to see him, thank you.

 Frustrated and sad regional Victorian Just a regional Vic resident here - living in an area that has 6 total cases of coronavirus since the pandemic started.   
Made this little photo from data from the DHHS website - data updated at 0717AM 18/08/20  
I'm sick of the media reporting that regional Victoria has a problem.   
Geelong - 75km from Melbourne - 159 cases  
Ballarat - 113kms from Melbourne - 24 cases  
Bendigo - 148kms from Melbourne - 44 cases  
Shepparton - 176kms from Melbourne - 19 cases  
These four towns are in the top 5 highest populated town in VIC and all within 200mks of Melbourne.  
I wish there was a lockdown on a 200kms radius of Melbourne so true regional VIC didn't have to suffer. My heart breaks for all the business's that have had to close, the university students that can't complete their studies (including nurses and paramedics) , everyone on bordertowns that are struggling to navigate the stupid permit system.  Residents in aged care homes that can't have visitors. There is so much more to VIC than Melbourne.   
But I guess we cant trust that city folk wont escape to regional areas for freedom so we join them in the lockdown. Bet if it was just in regional VIC Melb wouldn't be locking down in solidarity with us...

 Question: What if we isolated one state (region) and eased restrictions there as a test? Does anyone think that's not better than all states doing something different?  

With a lot of different restriction easing its very hard to get an idea of the actual impact.

If you ease restrictions in just one state (or region) and it gets substantially more cases than others then its pretty clear.

If all states ease to different level and the cases go up it could be just that we're heading into winter or something, and we would not have a clear measure of the restrictions.

Which state?   and why?

 RANT: NSW government decides to take their foot off the brakes, as Covid-19 cases accelerate. I was hopeful NSW is in the clear with no local spread for the last 2 weeks. Then new daily cases from the 13th - all seemingly from different unknown sources.

I think we put our foot off the brakes too early. Now instead of slowing things down a bit to reassess, the NSW government has decided they'll open everything up on the 1st of July. What the fuck.

 For all those in Victoria who'll be "outraged" about restrictions being relaxed too slowly today...Have a read at what Covid-19 does to your heart...young or old, and ask yourself, is this a disease you want to catch, or your family to catch? Young people are not invulnerable to Covid 19. Whilst it is less likely they are going to die. Catching Covid -19 isn't pretty for people's heart muscle. 

Today, "Dictator Dan" as people stupidly call him, will announce this "roadmap" out of restrictions and in all likelihood the whinging will begin. There are enough people out there who genuinely think that retail, and services being open trumps the damage from Covid-19...That their liberty trumps other peoples lives. Covid -19 is more dangerous to the heart muscle than previously realised. Ironically some of the people disputing that are the same type of people who listen to the likes on Donald Trump in March/April..."its just the flu...It'll be gone by summer"...Yeah....

 What's the reasoning behind Scott Morrison and co constantly referring to ALL forms of social distancing (including shutdowns) that will need to take place for at LEAST 6 months? Can someone please please explain to me why a 6-month lockdown of society in stage 3 is necessary???? That's all they keep sprouting is "any form of social distancing will need to be applied for 6 months, that includes any form of Shutdown" Scott Morrison

No country in the world has gone on lockdown for +6 months and would be stupid to do it. The virus is incredibly bad, but if they pull a 6+ month lockdown you'll get more domestic violence, more suicide, possibly crime relating to arson or breaking into closed stores. Then there's also other issues relating to mental health and then obviously the economy and it's a significant hit.

Yes the virus is bad, but any country needing to go on a six-month lockdown would create a whole range of problems bigger than the impact of this virus. 2 weeks up to 2 months I can understand, but 6 months? Can anyone provide some extent to why the government is thinking this? 

I know we are behind a few countries, but China took nearly 2 months to reopen some provinces, US reckon they're reopening non-essential trade within a month. I don't see where this data is coming from to suggest we need to have a 6-month society lockdown. Surely people are worried about this??? From what I'm reading most of the general public online would be okay with a six-month lockdown of society. I can understand if we've had 1000+ deaths, but we haven't. We've had under 10 deaths, and only about 20 people have required serious treatment. 2000+ in mild/no symptom condition and only 11 in serious condition. Yet, our government is bringing in these measures every 2nd day, completely grilling the public and not even waiting 2 weeks (when results will show if they're working). Yes, we will see increases in deaths etc, but wouldn't announce a 6-Month lockdown creates fear and panic? We've already seen supermarket panic buying, imagine a 6- month society lockdown. Is it fear-mongering or what? Because, he keeps referring to it, and most likely he will let this happen.

 Breakdown of tests Metro/Regional So now we're seeing a small number of cases (thankfully), it makes me wonder if the government should be providing a metro/regional split for numbers of tests, like they do for active cases and mystery cases.

At the moment, we are probably seeing a lot more regional testing due to Kilmore and Shepparton. But let's say we had 15,000 tests on a given day, and most of those were in regional Victoria, the low case number would be a little misleading, because, most of the virus is actually in the Metro area, and we aren't then doing the testing where it's actually needed.

Sidenote: I think they should also start their testing blitzes near where mystery cases are happening

 Face masks vs face shields I live in regional Vic and I popped in to Bunnings today for some essentials. I noticed that half the staff were not wearing masks and only had on those clear plastic visor shields. 

I had though those were a secondary protective measure for your face and not a replacement for masks. Am I wrong? Should they be wearing masks also?
