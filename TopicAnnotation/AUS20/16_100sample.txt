 Hairdressers/beauticians are (as of now) seen as essential services and are staying open.... As an hairdresser who has already been self isolating because of the anxiety from this whole thing, I think it’s absolutely ridiculous that’s (for now at least) that’s they are staying open. 

I mean I’m meant to be “going back to work” next week and I’m already super uncomfortable about the whole thing, so now my boss is saying “yep we are staying open” when I now it’s a bad idea and I know the girls at work are not good at social distancing (still going out drinking/partying) and we’ve had a scare of one of the girls potentially getting the virus, but yet we are still staying open.

I’m sorry but I don’t want to risk myself or my family (who are seen as high risk with pre-existing conditions) getting sick just because my boss refuses to close.

 Store Report - definite uptick in buying Took a trip to Coles on Northern Beaches and there is a significant uptick in the volume of buying.

All the usual is gone. No toilet paper, sanitizer, wipes etc.

Pasta is low, rice very low, cans not so much but still lower than normal.

Looking at trolleys everyone has more than what I would call a usual amount of food, especially of the above mentioned items

 Aussies returning home, what’s quarantine like $$? Are there any Australians that have had to recently return home and go through the quarantine procedure? I’ve had a scroll through this sub reddit but couldn’t find any answers to these questions but apologies if this is has been repeated! 
I am an Aussie citizen and I’m flying back to Sydney after finishing my masters degree here in Portugal at the end of September. I’d like to know how the quarantine process is /was for you. 
Mainly about costs- As a recently graduated student by then you can get an idea of how low my funds might be. Do you have to support the cost of the hotel they designate you? Meals etc.. Are you restricted to travel after those 14 days? Will you be required to pay for testing? 
The smart traveller website only states that you “may” have to support the costs but this depends on which state you’re in and “we expect more states and territories to be introducing charges” [smart traveller]( 

Any insight is much appreciated so that I can anticipate and set aside the necessary funds. Cheers!

 Any Word Whether Or Not Scott Morrison's Children Are Still Attending School? After Morrison's address yesterday where he stated he felt safe sending his kids to school, as a father I was naturally curious as to whether or not he was *actually* sending his kids school. Other than the fact that his kids attend a private Baptist school in Sidney, the details of his children's schooling isn't available online (nor should it be), but I was wondering if anyone has any info as to whether or not his children's school is a) still open, and b) if they're attending.

I've found his completely illogical justification for putting our children at the frontline of his 'herd immunity' strategy to be absolutely reprehensible, and would very much like to know if he's putting his (children's) money where his mouth is.

Not looking for specifics with regard to locations or school names, just whether or not he has his kids in school at this point in time.

 Partner walked the dog today and there were kids everywhere (ACT). Schools in the ACT are online only. This does not mean that your kids are free to roam the streets! Do not let your kids go to the park with friends, do not let them go to hang out at the shops. Keep them home! They have school work to do and they are not abiding by social distancing rules because they're kids and don't know how to. Absolutely disgusted at the shit parents who think this is just school holidays and don't want to take responsibility for their kids.

 Other Individuals More Vulnerable To Serious Complications From COVID-19 include those on Opioids, Individuals with Diabetes Mellitus, Cerebrovascular disease, Hypertension, and Coronary Heart Disease It's not only those over 65 who are 'at risk' of contracting COVID-19 and developing much more serious and severe symptoms from the virus but individuals with chronic pain conditions who are taking prescribed opioid for these conditions, according to GP's. Unfortunately, many Australians who are currently taking these medications are not aware how they compromise their immune system - not to mention other organs and bodily functions over time - and may not be aware they're in the same group as those over 65 regarding COVID-19.

Other individuals who are more susceptible to developing serious complications from COVID-19 include those who have diabetes mellitus which is estimated to be 1.2 million people (5.1% of the population) - and those are those who have been officially diagnosed with diabetes, not accounting for those with the condition who are unaware they have it. Then, according to the Lancet, there's adults who have cerebrovascular diseases, hypertension, and coronary heart disease. - [ 

Considering the large numbers of Australians who have been diagnosed with one or more of these health conditions, such as diabetes mellitus and/or hypertension (two conditions often comorbid) as well as coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease, as well as those taking prescribed opioids, it makes one wonder at the actual percentage of the population that should be added to those over 65 when considering who is more inclined to develop serious complications if they contract the coronavirus? It is thought-provoking, to say the least. 

If you read this and know someone with one or more of these conditions, let them know about the Lancet article concerning this matter. It does not mention those on opioids - for that they need to talk to their GP and it's not advisable to suddenly cease such medications considering not only the side-effects of sudden cessation but the increase in chronic pain, also. Nevertheless, it is prudent for anyone taking opioids or who knows someone who is to let them know these drugs decrease the body's natural immune response, to therefore take especial precautions to try to guard against any infectious conditions whether the 'common cold', seasonal influenza, or COVID-19.

 There is assymetry between your personal risk and societal risk Think of winning tattslotto. The individual chance of winning is very low. The risk for tattersalls having to pay out a winner is very high. So too, the risk of you personally getting corona is much lower than a superspreader somewhere giving it to high numbers of people. 
Another way to think of it, risk doesn't scale. So individuals have to be ****extremely risk averse to bring about a medium level of risk management at a societal level.  
What should we do about it? Remember every gun is loaded. Even if you know it isn't, you act if it is and don't point it at someone.  
You are the loaded gun. Pretend you have coronavirus in every situation even if you're sure you haven't.

 Essentials shopping - too many people &gt; Only one person per household can leave home to get necessary goods and services. They can leave once a day (this means you can’t do multiple shopping trips).

It is still quite disappointing to see so many people breaking these simple rules even with the numbers declining.

 4 things to do on quarantine  Being on quarantine for many people is emotionally difficult. Here are some tips how to spend time at home: 

1. Do ALL of your laundry, purge your home clean, and tidy up like there’s no tomorrow. 

 2. Work out at home. Can’t go to the gym? Do calf extensions on the steps, and pushups and planks like there’s no tomorrow.

3. Cook.Make a great YouTube recipe reality and create a meal to be proud of. It's a good idea to stock up on pasta, rice, canned vegetables, and spices.

 4. Do karaoke.There’s tons of free websites where you can not only belt out some high notes, but also have your friends join. Sing off the hard times.

 Don't touch the food! I think it's time to implement some measures around the touching items/food at the supermarkets that you aren't buying. I was in Coles and I saw a lady opening around 20 different cartons of eggs and touching all of the eggs with her bare hands. She was standing there for a good 5-10 minutes and I was absolutely disgusted to say the least. By this stage we are all very well versed in quickly getting in, buying what we need and getting out. There is absolutely no need to "browse". Having signage and getting the message out there to only touch what you are taking with you can be done and I think it will be come the norm as has social distancing. I understand that these measures would be tough to enforce but there has to be a better way!

 People who have kids at school, what (if any) measures are the school taking to keep kids well? For example, hand sanitiser on entry and exit, staggered playground use, staggered drop off and pick up, temperature checks, sending sick kids home, etc. I remember reading one school wanting kids to wear masks.

I know social distancing between students isn't required (or necessarily possible anyway), but I'm curious what (if any) other measures schools are using, besides a staged return.

Do you think they could be doing more? If so, what?

 [VIC] - Response to South Australian outbreak - 17 November 2020 *Media Release*  
*17 November 2020*

We are continuing to monitor the situation in South Australia closely and our authorised officers are meeting every flight from Adelaide into Melbourne airport as SA Health works to bring this coronavirus outbreak under control. 

Depending on their risk profile, passengers are being required to quarantine if they attended the high-risk exposure site at the Lyell McEwin Hospital or get tested and isolate until a negative result is received if they are from or have been to metropolitan Adelaide. All other South Australian travellers are advised to get tested if symptoms develop.

Yesterday, two flights arrived at Tullamarine from Adelaide. A total of 122 passengers were screened, with 81 tested. There were no arrivals who attended a high-risk location. 

Authorised officers took names and contact details of those arriving from South Australia, asked where they had been and completed temperature and symptom checks. 

No flights are scheduled into Melbourne airport or Mildura airport today from Adelaide. The next flights expected from Adelaide are due to arrive tomorrow.

Anyone who has been in SA in the last 14 days should check the exposure sites listed on the SA Health website and take the appropriate actions. For instance, if they were in the Lyell McEwin Hospital ED at the specified times, they should quarantine and contact DHHS for advice.

And if they have any symptoms, no matter how mild, they should get tested and self-isolate until the result is available.

Currently the SA border is closed to Victorians which is limiting cross-border traffic. 

The cross-border corridor extends 70km into Victoria from the border. Victorian cross-border community members who live within 70km of the SA border will be permitted to enter SA for any reason to travel anywhere within the 70km area from the border. SA cross-border residents are permitted to travel to Victoria for any reason anywhere within the 70km cross-border corridor.

There are also exemptions for essential workers, students returning, domestic violence, commercial transport and freight, urgent medical treatment, compassionate grounds, relocation, foreign diplomatic or consular staff and passing through.

“No border restrictions have been imposed at this stage, but we are continuing to monitor the situation in South Australia,” Victoria’s Deputy Chief Health Officer Professor Allen Cheng said.

“All cases in the outbreak in South Australia have known links and are currently within metropolitan Adelaide, so the risk to Victoria’s border communities is low.

“People in South Australia who have been at a high-risk location are required to quarantine, and the South Australian border is closed to most travellers from Victoria. We are also putting in place a range of other measures, including screening arrivals at Melbourne Airport, alerting aged care facilities and hospitals and continuing wastewater testing in western Victoria.”

 The process for approving travel exemptions is a joke. The Home affairs websites states that partners of Australian Citizens are allowed to travel to Australia.

&gt;You can travel to Australia if you are an immediate family member of an Australian citizen or permanent resident. You must provide evidence of your relationship and you must hold a valid visa before you travel.

After waiting several months without a response from home affairs, my partner had to miss her flight as she had been ignored. Shortly after that they sent a rejection notice; apparently we hadn't supplied enough evidence of our relationship. Today, we submitted again, this time, we submitted:

 *Personal Statements*

* My partner's personal statement

* My personal statement

* My passport (proof of citizenship)

o My partners passport

*Proof of Commitment*

* My partners statutory declaration

* My statutory declaration

* Facebook Messenger call history

* Terms of my will

* My partners pension beneficiary terms

*Financial Arrangements*

* Shared lease agreement

* Joint lease document

* Renter’s insurance in both names

*Social Matters*

* Proof of friends in common

* Proof relationship is public

* Proof of travel together

* Proof of shared recreational activities

* Evidence Monique is part of family Facebook group


And this afternoon? We got denied again; not enough proof that we are in a relationship. I'm honestly at a loss. They *SAY* that partners are allowed to travel to Australia, but the process they are putting us through is absolute torture.

 Physiotherapist Closing Private Practice Due to Corona Virus I wanted to get the general consensus on this issue.

I have closed my private Physiotherapy practice as I feel I am contributing the spread if I remain open. Although the ministry has health has advised me to stay open, I think it’s incredibly irresponsible to do so.
Mixed reviews from other Physio’s so could you guys tell me what you think?

Background: I operate out of a very busy medical centre that sees 500 patients + per day to GPs not including allied health, psychiatry and radiology. I work in a contract basis and pay the clinic a commission in every patient I see therefore i essentially have no overhead. I.e if I don’t work, I don’t make money but I don’t loose money.

My reasons are as follows:
1. Waiting room density is hard to enforce. People just don’t respect social distancing.
2. Elderly people still booking to come in for mild musculoskeletal conditions despite being told to stay home.
3. PPE supplies are low worldwide. If I continue to practice I will need to use PPE for infection control however this will ultimately take away from the frontline who will need all they can get.
4. Despite what the government says, FACE TO FACE PRIVATE PRACTICE PHYSIOTHERAPY IS NOT AN ESSENTIAL SERVICE. Same goes for podiatrist, hairdressers, nail salons, boutique shops,l etc etc. i have completely lost faith in the government response.

I am hoping Telehealth services will come online and I will continue to support my patients from a distance to give them advice and exercise management of their conditions. 

In the meantime I have expressed interest as a temporary staff in Queensland Health as I believe they will need all the help they can get on the frontline. I am young (30), healthy and my partner is a registered nurse on the frontline as well. We have no mortgage or children. This is our generations World War 3. I urge anyone in the same position as me to reach out to your state health department and express interest to help in any way you can. We the younger people are the ones who have to fight this. If you can’t help on the frontline then STAY THE FUCK HOME.

Cheers for the rant

&amp;#x200B;

They are over 10, and have a chance of not just getting sick but also being fatal 0.2% of the time. As per stats from China, they can also spread this virus easily to everyone including grandparents.

&amp;#x200B;

The virus will over run us in 1 or 2 weeks max anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

To all the parents out there like me who have a choice and are able to do this, take a stand and demand at home shooling , do society a favor and don't send them, keep them home.

&amp;#x200B;

If your circumstances don't allow you to do this, then fine no judgement from me, but I would rather be safe and keep them home. 

&amp;#x200B;

Schools are a breading ground, and it will make things worse, in NSW they are even saying that sending kids home may spread it faster, what a load of crap.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway in ONE more week it wont matter, so call in sick and don't send them for your kids and families sake.

 Victorian restrictions on shopping etc - should we allow people to shop or exercise near their workplace too? Under the current Victorian restrictions for stage 4 people can go out to buy food or exercise within 5km from home, and can go to work if in a permitted industry.

When at work, they cannot go out to buy takeaway food/coffee or to have a walk (unless work is also within 5km from home).

I am not sure how I feel about this - it cuts down the number of contacts, but buying takeaway for lunch or going for a walk seems reasonable to be able to do when at work.

I’m not sure if I am upset at this because it impacts me, or because it is actually unreasonable.   I work 12 hour days, and think I can manage a 15 minute window for exercise by rearranging my morning routine completely.

 Victoria is (unofficially pursuing elimination). What does this mean for NSW, SA and QLD borders? What about other states? Supposedly QLD is now saying they "hope" to have borders open to both NSW and VIC by Christmas.

NSW is officially not pursuing elimination.

SA will probably do the same as QLD. 

What does this mean? NSW and VIC will be first to open borders; but if VIC's plan does work and it does eliminate, will it want to risk a third wave being open to non-elimination NSW? I honestly can't imagine VIC taking any more lockdowns ever again.

What will QLD do then?

After Dec 2022 I have no work here anymore, and would want to return home so my kids can grow up in Aus with their grandparents nearby etc. I know it's all just guesswork, but does anyone think there could come a point where Australian citizens are not able to return home?

2) More people have died and will die. The death rate for children with COVID19 is 6% and the overall death rate is 2%.
3) My great great auntie cannot visit us this year because of the health risk
4) My brother cannot use school equipment (they had a rule where you couldn’t bring your own as to prevent theft) and they STILL let him share his own. He is no longer attending school.
5) Sick people were not sent home from my school. I am now staying home as I am high risk, however would even if I weren’t.

This would’ve been manageable and dealt with if people stayed home, our schools were closed sooner and legal action was taken. It’s not “living your life”, it’s taking life away.

 For all those people who are demanding we close our schools. How are we going to make sure that the kids are being looked after? I've been trying to do research and get a feel for this as much as I can but I'm really not in the position to say. We don't have any kids just yet. While I think from one point of view it would be a great benefit to close the schools in an effort to flatten the curve I'm wondering from a logistical point of view how we would get all those dual income families to look after their children.

Going off some numbers I got from here: [ more than two thirds of households are dual income families with children under 18. I understand this will include young children who are in childcare but it is what it is. Ultimately we should all be working from home, so I guess there should be someone at home to make sure your kids are remaining at home. 

For those households where both parents are unable to work from home, who is going to look after their children? Do you think one person will take leave and remain at home? Are we going to ask grandparents to come look after them? I was reading that the CDC was using this exact example as why they don't want to close schools. This would raise the number of older, more vulnerable people being exposed to the virus when they should really be staying at home practising good social distancing measures.

I guess the main reason for this post was to get different perspectives on this issue. I'm pretty much cooped up at home as I imagine a lot of us are and I have no one else to really ask. A good comment from  u/shengbat in another thread about why they didn't enforce the mass gathering "ban" straight away gave me pause for thought and ultimately I was less stressed/angry about the whole situation. I think we all would be better off if we were less stressed.

The Federal Government is considering helping Qantas and Virgin operate specific services to bring Australians stuck overseas home.

If you (or your family) are still overseas, the government is urging all Australians to return home as soon as possible.

But with many flights cancelled, the government says it is in talks with Australian airlines to put on new flights to bring people home.

It says this will only be done on a case-by-case basis, where all other commercial options have been exhausted, where local authorities permit flights, and only to those outside the epicentre of the outbreak.

My work visa ends in October and I've chosen to stay the full duration as my partner (uk citizen) can't come back with me until boarders re-open.

My inquiry is, when connecting flights in other countries, are you subject to quarantine there? or does it only come into effect once my journey is done. Cause from my understanding, I have 2 connecting flights (Amstadam &amp; Hong Kong) and I could be pulled off and qurantined at any point ontop of being qurantined again once returning home.

 PM Media Release: Tasmania to help more Australians return home *07 Nov 2020*

*Prime Minister, Minister for Foreign Affairs*

The Australian and Tasmanian Governments have agreed to provide an additional 450 spaces in quarantine facilities in Hobart hotels to help more Australians return home from abroad.

The Tasmanian Government has indicated it would increase its quarantine capacity spaces if it can confirm additional hotel contracts, which will then make it possible for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, in partnership with Qantas, to arrange facilitated commercial flights to help Australians return home.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the additional capacity was on top of the 6,315 weekly quarantine spaces currently agreed to by states and territories.

“We’re working every option to help as many Australians return home as quickly as possible,” the Prime Minister said.

“We thank Premier Gutwein and his government for their willingness to help us tackle the challenges our friends and family are facing overseas amidst the pandemic.”

The Commonwealth is continuing to work with state and territory authorities to further increase the quarantine capacity they can offer, as well as further facilitated flights.

Tasmanian Premier Peter Gutwein said Tasmania was pleased to support the national effort to help Australians in need.

“Tasmania will never turn its back on its fellow Australians, and as I have said for some time, we stand ready to play our role to help bring Australians home,” the Premier said.

“This is being achieved in a COVID-safe way for returning Australians and Tasmanians, with all inbound passengers required to be tested prior to travel, and will need to return a negative COVID-19 test on or after day 10 of their quarantine period before entering our community.

“This deal also means supporting our hotel industry which has seen a significant downturn in bookings this year.”

Minister for Foreign Affairs Marise Payne said DFAT officials would work with Qantas to ensure the most vulnerable Australians registered are given priority access to these flights.

“Our focus is on helping Australians who want and need to return,” Minister Payne said.

“More than 411,000 Australians have returned since 13 March and around 30,600 have been assisted by the Australian Government including on 66 directly facilitated flights.”

The Government continues to assist vulnerable Australians overseas through consular assistance and through the Hardship Program. Financial assistance is available to help cover the costs of flights where other sources of finance have been exhausted.

More than 7,000 Australians of the 26,200 registered with DFAT on 18 September have returned since, including around a quarter who were considered vulnerable.

We continue to encourage Australians trying to return to Australia from overseas to register with DFAT through the nearest embassy or high commission or via Smartraveller.

The Government is underwriting the cost of the flights, and airfares will be available at commercial rates to passengers, with loans through DFAT available to those who need assistance.

More details on the flights will be available on [smartraveller.gov.au]( and [qantas.com](

 University of the Sunshine Coast's COVID-19 response Just got sent this e-mail:

USC is closely monitoring government advice regarding the best measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.  A key prevention strategy is social distancing.

To better implement this strategy, USC is pausing all coursework teaching and assessments (lectures, tutorials, lab classes, fieldwork, exams and online assessments, etc) at our Queensland campuses for one week from Monday 23 March. This includes exams which have been scheduled to occur next week, including online exams. We will continue to conduct placements during this time.

This pause will enable the redesign of face-to-face teaching and assessments to modes which support social distancing.  

All our campuses will remain open. The library, food services and study spaces will be operating and staff will be working, with additional hygiene and sanitation measures as well as enhanced social distancing measures.

Learning and teaching will resume on Monday 30 March using technology-enabled learning and teaching.  You will receive communications next week from your Course Coordinators regarding new arrangements for your teaching and learning and assessments.

 Working during Covid-19 I work on the front line in a busy bottle shop/supermarket in a hotspot in Sydney. 
Keeping our essential services open is all good and well but what about the health of our frontline? 
All of last week I was serving people (over 1000 people in the week) in a packed shop with people who were coughing and sneezing all over the shop and putting both myself and my team in huge amounts of risk and stress. 
The only measure that had been put in place was a bottle of hand sanitizer and a box of tissues and I was told by management that measure was the only thing that had to legally do and was in tune with the national health department. 

I have had to take leave without pay because I couldn’t handle it anymore over concern and stress, I’m happy to still be hired in this craziness but at what cost?

I have mentioned to my up-line my concerns about contracting the virus at work and bringing it home to my family, I was told that I should just forget about it all.
We have been told by the health minister that it is crucial to stay inside and practice social distancing on the highest regard or risk contracting the disease. So why are workers put in these high risk situations?
I feel like if any number of the workers contracted covid-19 then they have a high chance in spreading the virus to the community as well.

Why has the delivery services from both Coles and Woolworths been stopped forcing people to go into these environments? 

I think it’s irresponsible sending people to work in these high risk outlets and surround themselves with potentially sick people all day every day until a cure is found.

Thoughts?

Problem is the Government not giving me the option to do that.

Should I write a letter and explain my position and risk fines?

 If you attend the BLM protests this coming weekend, you risk everything we've had to sacrifice so much for. You are risking another outbreak. You are risking further restrictions. You are risking people being out of work for longer, not being able to afford rent or groceries for longer, not being able to see their families overseas for longer. You are undoing everything that we have worked so hard for over the past two and a half months. This is not about you and your beliefs, this is about community health.

 If all the caregivers in a house are sick, can a child stay with friends? What is the protocol here? 

I'm sick and so's dad. Like proper getting bad sick. 

It's probably nothing but let's pretend it's not. 

We're both a bit vulnerable as he's over 70 and just had an operation, me, I've got all the congenital lung/heart/spinal abnormality/asthma/chronic respiratory disorder crap. 

Point is if this goes belly up it could go bad quick and that leaves a kid without caregivers. 

I'm a sole parent, I moved to the middle of nowhere to care for my dad, brought kid. Now we're rural. 

Now we're sick. I'm sure we'll be fine but if we get worse we can't look after her. 

Send her interstate to family, how? Everything's locked down and we don't have anyone here. 

**Can we ask a school friend's family to take her in?** She's fine but kids can be asymptomatic carriers, right? Won't we be risking another families health too?

Is it even appropriate to ask?

 Some people have asked why the Government isn't taking harder faster measures. And what next steps might be. Here is an excerpt from the AHPPC media statement, explaining the reasoning behind their recommendations.  **Quote from the** [most recent media]( **statement from AHPPC**

AHPPC noted that the new restrictive social distancing measures have only just been introduced and that the border measures and enhancing quarantining provisions for returned travellers are also recent. It is too early to assess the impact of current social distancing measures.

AHPPC noted there remains scope for more aggressive contact tracing and enforcement of quarantine for contacts; this is in progress and is of equal importance to the social distancing measures.

Whilst clarification and enhancement of the existing measures (which address the highest risk gatherings) are important, additional, materially more disruptive measures, should ideally be held in reserve until some assessment of the initial measures is possible.

The next step, if required, is likely to be a carefully considered closure of all activity except essential industries and services.

All states and territories are in agreement with the above position, except Victoria, who expressed the desire for even stronger measures at this time.

 Supermarkets and pharmacies in NSW will be able to stay open for 24 hours &gt; The aim of this is to make it easier for people to buy food and medical supplies during the coronavirus pandemic.
 
&gt; Planning Minister Rob Stokes on Wednesday scrapped the usual planning controls that restrict trading hours.
 
&gt; "These orders cut red tape so we can move quickly and decisively to ensure the health, wellbeing and safety of our community during this time," Mr Stokes said in a statement.
 
&gt; "The focus of our first order is giving people the flexibility to visit their local supermarket, pharmacy or corner store at any time of day if those retail premises choose to operate for extended hours."
 
&gt; Mr Stokes said the change would also provide greater flexibility for home-based businesses to operate at any time and expand their business as necessary.
 
&gt; "For those businesses operating out of home, we are facilitating more flexible operating hours and increasing the number of people working together from two to five, providing they can abide by the social distancing rules," the minister said.
 
&gt; "This is important as more and more people work from home and need flexible working arrangements."

I know borders are remaining closed to Vic, but surely opening up to other states when there’s always a lag in finding positive cases is taking a big risk? As a QLDer, I would love to not be so worried about this so I would welcome any arguments in favour of opening the border/reassurance it’ll be OK!

 Shopping for "Essentials" I work in retail, so apparently I am an essential worker. Not supermarket retail, but one other the department stores that isnt closed. There has been a lot of talk about only going out for essentials so why the hell are we still open when the only essentials we provide are things you can get elsewhere and are a low percentage of what we sell?

Yesterday I was working and it was exceptionally busy, like, xmas levels of busy. People out buying things that are not essential at all like toys and decorative homewares and a fucking gazebo while barely maintaining any social distancing and giving our store security guard shit when he asks them to distance.

Is there any way to stop these people coming in to basically use our store as a destination to cure their boredom? Myself and staff are livid that these dickheads are just browsing the store and putting staff at risk just so they can entertain themselves while having the ability and luxury to stay home. Can we call the cops and do they have powers now to tell people to get out if they are just buying things that aren't essential?

 How are your kids coping? In my attempt to try and remain positive, I forgot to ask my 12 year old how he was feeling about all of this.

They see the news, they are aware of the panic, but they are given the least information. 

This morning, I felt a tap on my shoulder while I was sleeping and he asked me "Mama, am I allowed to have breakfast during this?" I was like "What? Yes baby! We have enough!" and he replied "But there's nothing left in the shops."

He asked for 1 slice of toast (he seems to want to hoard what we have), so I took him the biggest bowl of cereal he has ever seen. The smile. 

I had to make him lunch and deliver it to his bedroom, otherwise, he wouldn't have eaten. 

I am sitting down with him this afternoon and taking him through the supply of food I have in the freezer (I always bulk buy during specials, so I am well stocked) and reminding him about why I have decided to self isolate him. 

At the risk of sounding like Maude, please think of the children.
