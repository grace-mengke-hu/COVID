 Time series data of positive Victoria Covid-19 tests. Hi, attached are CSV files for [active]( and [cumulative]( Covid-19 cases in Victorian LGA's from 2020-05-07 to 2020-07-18.

These files were generated from an automated process, and does not contain positive tests from an unknown LGA. I hope these files may be useful in calculating the percentage change at an LGA level for example.

Very heartening to see Victorians are succeeding in slowing the spread of the virus. I hope things will start improving as we start heading out of Winter.
