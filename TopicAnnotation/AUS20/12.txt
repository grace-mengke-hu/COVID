 Should Dan Andrews be made Premier for Life? It seems obvious that Dan Andrews has saved Victoria from total annihilation from this virus. He is the only leader in the entire world who has taken this situation serious from the beginning. Somehow he has managed to not make a single misstep along the way - I attribute that to his extreme devotion to the state and his impeccable work ethic.  
  
Every other politician has worried about optics or tried to politicise the virus but Dan Andrews is solely concentrating on helping the people of Victoria in any way they can. He has not taken a single day off all year and likely sleeps only a few hours every day. Every waking moment is dedicated to eradicating this virus.  
  
I simply cannot see how any other person could possibly match his leadership so why bother? Just declare him Premier for Life and it'll be one less thing he has to worry about. Additionally - having an election during this pandemic is Un-Australian.

 “Protect the vulnerable” In the context of discussions around lockdown I keep hearing mention of alternative options where we open back up and “protect the vulnerable”. Saves businesses, the economy etc etc. AND protects lives. The holy grail. 

What does this actually mean? How can this be achieved other than by completely segregating the vulnerable (which is not just aged care homes, but anyone with co-morbidities or weak immune systems, including children) from the rest of society? Which in itself is not ethical or viable but aside from that...I’m genuinely interested to hear if this alternative scenario exists in any practical way?

 SWiFT model update 13/08 It feels crazy to say it, but for the second time we've managed to predict the day's case number within a margin of 1 case. Now there is some good news and something we need to be cautious with looking forward.

The good news is that our model is still very accurate, laser accurate in some regards which is great, it means we're going in the right direction for the most part. This should still give people optimism that we'll be at single digits come September and an end of Stage 4 during that period looks very likely.

&amp;#x200B;

Here comes the note for caution. The real case rolling 3 day average sits above our model by 29. It means we need tomorrow to sit around 215 to stay within projections. If we have a 400 day tomorrow we will drift away from our model. Luckily once that 410 disappears from our 3 day average on Saturday we can drive that average back in line with the model if we get the next 2 days between 200-300.

&amp;#x200B;

I would urge people to stay optimistic, we're very much in alignment with the real numbers coming in for the last 7 days now, we're all very confident of how good we're looking going forward.

&amp;#x200B;

Also interesting news to add, we had a senior member of DHHS reach out to us wanting to get more information and insight from our model, and they are also looking at our projections which is very humbling. Thanks for all your support guys :)

 How are commute times for those living in Melbourne and travelling from lockdown for work into Geelong and other areas? Genuinely curious about this as I have a teaching role starting in Geelong next month (August) and will need to drive from Melbourne to Geelong for this. So for those of you out there, how have things been driving to work in areas outside of the "ring of steel", has there been any significant increase in travel time due to the checking of paperwork at the police checkpoints?

 COVIDSafe and suspect behaviour I’m just gonna flat out ask the question on everyone’s mind. Will the authorities ever be able to use the data from COVIDSafe to link to behaviour that may considered suspect?

We all know what the apps intended use is, we all know they have said that it’s data will only be used for assisting the community in the Coronavirus crisis - but can they/will they/what will happen if they use the data to assist in other enquires not related to the Covid-19 pandemic?

Asking for a friend...
