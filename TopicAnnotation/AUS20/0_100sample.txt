 Anyone expecting Essential vs Non-Essential to be a lasting issue after COVID19? E.G Essential workers have Essential printed on their licence plates.

Non-Essentials have it stamped on their 1 day exercise permits?

 Empty Platitudes in a Time of Crisis - Do the people standing outside clapping for the faceless, nameless essential workers feel as though they are genuinely contributing to something or is it just the latest iteration of slacktivism?

 Lockdown to just essential services Everyone is (rightfully) talking about locking down and only allowing essential services to go to work. After all, we can do everything online, right?

So how come no one is listing ISPs and IT workers that make the internet function as essential workers?

 Opinion/discussion: what is essential??? What is essential in people's opinions and when it comes to the restrictions?
Are fast food restaurants (drive thru) essential? Is a Kmart/target essential? Is a bunnings or an IKEA essential? Are clothing stores essential? What about a jb-hi-fi or good guys?

I work in a telco retail store, everything we do on a store level can be done over the phone or live chat (adding some days for shipping) but my area manager has just let us all know we are essential to stay open. 

Is anyone else's jobs claiming they are essential but you can't figure out why? 

Comment below literally anything to do with this, I'm so scattered right now
