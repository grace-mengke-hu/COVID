 It's 3AM in the morning and I can't sleep so I say peak56 has been beaten by a straight line It's 3AM in the morning and I can't sleep so I say peak56 has been beaten by a straight line.

Peak56 model has been my main model for the decline in the number of daily cases in Victoria but it has been over comed by a much better model called Linear. In other words it has been beaten by a **Straight Line.**

To illustrate, I would use some graphs. To start with, I used a graph of Victoria Daily cases

&amp;#x200B;



Next we take a Log scale graph of the Daily Cases

&amp;#x200B;



We then approximate the with a straight line (indicated by the red line). Remember that this ia a log scale graph.

&amp;#x200B;



&amp;#x200B;



Next we convert this back to our normal graph using

linear(t) = exp(10.315902985612235 + -0.06686833778022322 \* t)

And produce this graph

&amp;#x200B;



Now for the complete Shocker, it predicts **reality** better than peak56 model

&amp;#x200B;



&amp;#x200B;



&amp;#x200B;



Both peak56 and Linear

&amp;#x200B;



The Linear model predicts better than peak56 model after August 25 2020. It also explains the **anomaly** on the 3rd September 2020.

 How many times do I need to get tested? I've had the same symptoms for months - mild headache, a bit of fluid in the ear, sniffles, sometimes a sore throat.  I've been tested three times and always negative.  I attribute it to the mould in the rental we live in.  Do I need to get tested again?  At the last test, the nurse jammed the stick hard into my nostril and then yelled (actually raised her voice) when I jerked back a little.  Of course I'll go and get tested if I need to, but it's the same symptoms and I feel it's a bit of waste of resources.

 Wild suggestion: test everyone in Melbourne It's now clear that if we want to go back to normal and be able to stay there we need to eliminate the virus from the community. This cannot be achieved in a timely fashion with the present lockdown, and small pockets will likely still remain.

I would like to see us take a more proactive approach to fighting this virus. The simple brute-force approach would be to test every person in Melbourne. How could this be achieved? Here I would like to speculate on how we could use pooled testing to make this practical.

It is critical that all testing be achieved within a few weeks, it wouldn't be helpful if it took the rest of the year to test everyone. Lets say we set a goal of 4 weeks.

There are 4.9 million people in Melbourne but only 1.8 million households. If we are going for elimination it should make little difference who in a household tests positive, the whole household should be on strict isolation orders. Therefore we don't need to be any more specific than this and just aim to identify positive households. 

Testing 1.8 million households in 4 weeks equates to 64,000 tests per day - not sounding so crazy now! but it is still probably unrealistic. To get this down to our current testing rates of 20-30k, we would need to pool 2-3 households tests together. This means more negative people would be forced to isolate along with their neighbors, which isn't ideal, but not the end of the world. To mitigate these effects, LGA's with more positives could test every household, while the others pool 4-5 together.

What do you think? what other ambitious strategies could be used to beat this virus?

 Childcare centre closes in Melbourne. Guardian Childcare and Education East Ivanhoe has been closed after the parents of a child tested positive to COVID-19. Several of the children also attend nearby Fairy Hills kindergarten which has been contacted for comment.  

A childcare centre in Melbourne’s northeast has been closed after the parents of a child tested positive to COVID-19.

Guardian Childcare and Education East Ivanhoe Statement provided a statement to The Australian that the centre has been cleaned three times since the parents were last in the centre on Friday.

The centre said it immediately contacted the Department of Health Victoria and was advised that the risk of contracting the virus as the result of a pick-up or drop-off was low.

The centre also notified other parents at the centre.

One of the educators has also undergone testing for coronavirus but as of Thursday no educators have tested positive.

The centre will undergo another full disinfectant clean and the decision to re-open will be based on advice from the relevant Health Authority.

Several of the children also attend nearby Fairy Hills kindergarten which has been contacted for comment.

 ScoMo just said we had one of the highest test rates in the world at 147 000 Does anyone know how this stacks up?

That equates to 5764 tests per a million people. 

South Korea had only officially tested [4099]( people per a million as of March 9th, when they had [7478 confirmed cases]( That honestly sounds like pretty good news and might mean there's far less unknown cases out there then other countries.

[This article]( claims the US has only conducted twice as many tests as us, and they are clearly in far worse shape.

 [NSW] Second quarantine guard to test positive for COVID-19 worked with first guard A second guard at a quarantine hotel in Sydney to test positive to COVID-19 worked on a shift with the first guard, NSW Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant has said.

The man, who tested positive at about midnight last night, was one of 700 people tested after the first guard tested positive.

Dr Chant said the man, who had no symptoms, worked on the same shift with the other guard on August 3, but there was currently not an "immediate connection" between them.

The second guard then worked at the Sheraton Grand Hyde Park overnight on August 16, but it was not clear if he was infectious at that time.

All 699 other people who were tested after the first guard's case came back negative.

Urgent testing will be carried out this weekend to determine if the second quarantine hotel security guard to test positive for COVID-19 in Sydney has the same virus strain as the first.

NSW Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant said in a media conference on Saturday afternoon that the second guard and four close contacts are currently being managed in a health facility.

Dr Chant said although the second guard worked on the same shift as the first on August 3, at Sydney Harbour Marriott Hotel, the urgent genome sequencing would be completed by Monday "for the ultimate investigative thoroughness".

"It's critical that we don’t jump to conclusions," Dr Chant said.

She said the second guard's viral load was "quite low" so there may be issues with the ability to carry out the sequencing.

Dr Chant said it is "reassuring" that the second guard is the only other case to emerge after 700 people were tested following the first quarantine security guard testing positive.

"This is a very tricky virus," Dr Chant said.

"The first security guard in effect led us to this second security guard. That's the responsibility we all have, is to rock up and get this testing done [when we have any symptoms]."

 Getting tested for Covid-19 and informing workplace? Hi,

As a hypothetical question, if you were to get tested for COVID-19 (and you had mild symptoms) are you required to inform your workplace that you have been tested while you are still waiting for your results?

Should you use sick days until the result comes back and then inform them if it is positive?

&amp;#x200B;



 Graph format updated slightly - constructive feedback is welcome and will always be considered.

A testing target of [1 in 40]( per fortnight has been raised by DHHS coronavirus testing head Jeroen Weimar. This translates to a daily testing target of \~11,700, which has been added to the graph as the dashed line.

Note: I do this on the actual new cases / the number of reported tests. Some other places do it on the 'net new' cases. I prefer this way, as this is the daily snapshot - The *actual* number of positives from the previous 24 hours vs the *actual* number of tests processed. Reclassified numbers could have been from any time. This way will give slightly higher ratios, and is pessimistic about the 14d average. These are the state wide gross numbers - DHHS seem to be a bit of a black box in how they get their averages. It's important you, the reader, understand these points for yourself. A positivity ratio of 1% does not imply that 1% of the wider population is infected - the tests are not of a random sample of the population.

 NSW Gov: NSW hits three million tests as community urged to remain vigilant 27 October 2020

As the state marks three million COVID-19 tests since January, the NSW Government is calling on the community to continue to work together to fight the deadly virus.

Premier Gladys Berejiklian said reaching three million tests was a major milestone in the state’s fight against [COVID-19](

“I want to thank everyone in NSW who has come forward to be tested – three million COVID-19 tests is an incredible result,” Ms Berejiklian said. 

“As we ease restrictions, it is critical that we maintain our high rates of testing which has been central to our success in limiting the spread of the virus and keeping NSW open.”

Health Minister Brad Hazzard warned that while recent easing of restrictions is very welcome, it comes with risks and it is critical everyone keeps getting tested.

“This is a stealthy virus and if we give it an inch, it will take a mile and undo a lot of good work,” Mr Hazzard said.

“The community response to COVID-19 has been fantastic and I thank the people of NSW for their efforts and sacrifices during the past nine months, which have put us in a position where we have been able to ease restrictions.

“We hope to be able to continue to ease restrictions in the weeks and months ahead, but this depends on us being successful in minimising community transmission.”

As at 8pm on 26 October 2020, 3,000,641 COVID-19 tests had been performed on 2,247,101 people in NSW. Of those people tested, 63.7 per cent had a single test and 36.3 per cent had more than one test, with 1.16 per cent having more than five tests.

NSW Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant said it was critical that people continue to come forward for testing and practice COVID-safe behaviours when out and about and catching up with family and friends.

“When we have high numbers of people continuing to get tested, that allows us to detect cases in the community earlier and prevent onward transmission,” Dr Chant said.

“Get tested at the first sign of even the [mildest of symptoms]( wash your hands regularly, physically distance and wear a mask when using public transport and in places where you can’t physically distance.

“We have been able to get the recent clusters under control with the support of the community, but their emergence shows that the risk of a resurgence of cases in NSW remains very real.”

Restrictions eased recently by the NSW Government include:

* 30 people can now gather outdoors in public spaces (previously the rule was 20 people). It remains a maximum of 20 people in households
* there can be 30 customers per booking, and 30 customers per table, at hospitality venues (previously the rule was a maximum of 10 customers)
* corporate functions of up to 300 people can now be held at any appropriate premises, including at restaurants, subject to a COVID safety plan (previously it was just function centres)
* religious gatherings/places of worship (excluding weddings and funerals) can have up to 300 people, subject to a COVID-19 safety plan
* gyms are now only required to have a [COVID-19 safety marshal]( if there are more than 20 people in the gym at one time.

Additionally, from 1 December 2020, the number of people who can attend weddings will be increased to 300 people subject to the four square metre rule indoors and two square metre rule outdoors. This will allow people to make plans and book venues knowing the capacity ahead of time.

There are more than [300 COVID-19 testing locations]( across NSW. Find your nearest [clinic]( or contact your GP. Most people receive their results within 24 hours.

 [VIC] Residents of Geelong’s northern suburbs and Lara urged to get tested after wastewater finding Media Release  
*26 November 2020*

Coronavirus fragments have been detected in a wastewater sample  collected from the Oyster Cove wastewater treatment plant in Corio.

Residents and visitors to Geelong’s northern suburbs and Lara from  Saturday 21 to Tuesday 23 November are urged to get tested if they have  any symptoms, no matter how mild. 

The result is unexpected given that there are no residents in the  area known to have recently had a coronavirus (COVID-19) illness or  diagnosis. 

Samples of untreated wastewater are analysed for fragments of  SARS-CoV-2 – the virus that causes coronavirus (COVID-19) – at more than  50 wastewater treatment plants across Victoria. 

Acting Chief Health Officer Allen Cheng said the viral fragments may  be because of residents or people visiting these areas shedding the  virus. People who have had coronavirus may shed the virus or virus  fragments for several weeks in their stool, well beyond their infectious  period.

“We have had few of these positive wastewater results recently and,  while we haven’t discovered any undiagnosed case of coronavirus  (COVID-19), it is possible that there may be an infectious person in  this catchment,” Professor Cheng said.

“We encourage people in this area who are symptomatic to be tested  and will update the community once more testing results become  available.”

“It is also a timely reminder for local businesses to re-check their  COVID Safe plans to keep themselves, their colleagues and customers  safe.”

Viral fragments were last week detected in wastewater in Altona,  Benalla and Portland despite no known local people with recent  coronavirus (COVID-19) infection.

Increased testing of residents and visitors in these locations has not revealed anyone with the virus. 

For a full list of testing locations, visit the [Where to get tested]( page. 

More information on wastewater testing is on the [Department of Health and Human Services website](

A list of wastewater sampling locations and latest results can be found on the [Wastewater monitoring webpage](

 Daily Tests/Positive Ratio, 27 Aug Daily 0.44% positivity ratio, 113 cases on 25,470 test results. (I think this is an outlier due to the high reported testing rate today)  
3Day Avg: 0.89%, 137 Cases, 17337 Tests  
7Day Ave: 0.89%, 156 Cases, 18463 Tests



Note: I do this on the actual new cases / the number of reported tests. Some other places do it on the 'net new' cases. I prefer this way, as this is the daily snapshot. This way will give slightly higher ratios. It's important you, the reader, understand what the difference is. A positivity ratio of 1% does not imply that 1% of the wider population is infected - the tests are not of a random sample of the population. 

I have done this as a post rather than a comment in the daily thread as the test numbers were published so late. I don't intend to do this as a post every day unless the test numbers are published late again. Feedback welcome on this.

 Newborn baby tests positive to COVID-19 in Melbourne A baby under three weeks old tested positive to coronavirus at Melbourne's Royal Children's Hospital.

It's not clear when the baby tested positive and if they are still considered an active case.

Associate Professor Tom Connell, a paediatrician and chief of medicine at the children's hospital, said the case served as a warning that newborn babies are vulnerable to COVID-19.

"Children are susceptible to COVID-19," he told 3AW's Neil Mitchell earlier today.

"It's not just an adult disease. There's still a lot we don’t know about it."

When asked how the baby was diagnosed, Associate Professor Connell said: "It's usually a parent who's used their intuition to say there's something not quite right with their baby.

"We have obviously a lot of babies admitted every year to the hospital with viral infections, many, many under three weeks of age - under two weeks of age even."

Common symptoms among babies include decreased feeding, fast breathing and fever, Associate Professor Connell said.

 2nd Australian Death Confirmed. Total Cases in NSW rise to 22. NSW Health has confirmed a 95-year-old woman who died at a Sydney nursing home tested positive for coronavirus.

Last night the health department confirmed five more cases in the state, bringing the number of infections in NSW since the COVID-19 outbreak began to 22.

The 95-year-old resident at the Dorothy Henderson Lounge in Macquarie Park, in Sydney's north, died on Tuesday in hospital. Another elderly resident at the facility also tested positive for the virus.

An aged-care worker at the facility was diagnosed with coronavirus earlier this week, becoming the third person to be infected via human-to-human transmission in Australia.

NSW chief medical officer Dr Kerry Chant said the five new cases also included a female doctor who worked at Liverpool Hospital, and a female on the Northern Beaches.

"The female doctor who was diagnosed on March 4 had no history of overseas travel," she said.

"We are immediately establishing which staff and patients may need to self-isolate and be tested for COVID-19 should they be unwell."

A 50-year-old man from Cronulla and a 60-year-old woman, who is believed to have returned from the Philippines, also tested positive.

Her travel details are being obtained and will be disclosed if it is decided that she posed a risk to any other passengers on her flight.

NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard said the aged-care worker had contact with 13 residents of the Macquarie Park home, and that two of them, including the woman who died, subsequently reported respiratory symptoms.

The other affected resident is an 82-year-old man who is being treated in hospital after testing positive on Tuesday.

It is unclear how the worker contracted coronavirus, as she had not been overseas.

She is now in a stable condition at Royal North Shore Hospital.

"It is concerning when we have someone present with coronavirus and we can't track the source," Mr Hazzard said.

"[NSW] Health is looking at how we can step up some of the testing that goes on with some of the people who present with respiratory symptoms that in the normal course may not have been considered for coronavirus testing."

Dr Chant rejected the suggestion the Macquarie Park facility needed to be in full lockdown and said infection control staff visited last night.

She said it was pleasing to note that the centre had already taken a "lot of steps" to raise infection control.

 Is there any bad side effect from nasopharyngeal swab test(covid-19 nasal swab test)? I had this test 2 days ago. The first day I had nose bleed and tingling sensation in the back of my head. Few days later, I developed otitis because I noticed that there’s some liquid leaked from my right ear and it feels really itchy( not sure if it’s related). Is this nasal swab test safe?

 Cold/flu test I understand Australia is running low on the chemical needed to test for the Coronavirus and the health system needs to use discretion when giving out tests to try to target people more likely to be carrying the virus than the cold/flu.

But are people who are displaying symptoms of the virus who haven’t been overseas or in contact with a confirmed case been tested for cold and flu? 

I don’t know the science involved or what’s needed to carry out such a test but why not test these people for cold/flu and if those test come back negative then test for coronavirus?

I am sure I heard the Mayor of New York talking about this on The Daily Show but haven’t heard it talked about in Australia.

 Boris Johnson Tests Positive for COVID-19 Boris Johnson tests positive for CORVID-19

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has tested positive for coronavirus.

Mr Johnson said he developed mild symptoms over the past 24 hours, including a temperature and cough.

He said he will now self-isolate in No 10 but will "continue to lead the government's response via video-conference as we fight this virus".

Mr Johnson was last seen on Thursday night, as he clapped outside No 10 as part of a nationwide gesture to thank NHS staff.

In a video on his Twitter account, Mr Johnson said: "I'm working from home and self-isolating and that's entirely the right thing to do.

"But, be in no doubt that I can continue thanks to the wizardry of modern technology to communicate with all my top team to lead the national fightback against coronavirus.

"I want to thank everybody involved and, of course, our amazing NHS staff."

He was tested at No 10 by NHS staff, on the personal advice of England's chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, Downing Street said.

He will still be in charge of the government's handling of the crisis, the statement added.

There are more than 11,600 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK, and 578 people have died.

Earlier this week, the prime minister's spokesman confirmed that Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, as the first secretary of state, was the selected minister to stand in if Mr Johnson became unwell.

It comes after the Prince of Wales also tested positive for the virus earlier this week.

Prince Charles, 71, is to be displaying mild symptoms "but otherwise remains in good health", a spokesman said.

 South Australia records 1 new interstate case A South Australian man, in his 40s, was granted an exemption to travel to and from Victoria as an essential worker. He tested negative on July 10, but later tested positive on July 22.

Chief Public Health Officer Professor Nicola Spurrier says the man has been in quarantine during the infectious period. However, Spurrier says there is a chance the man’s family, who he has been at home with, could have contracted the virus. The entire family and close contacts are now self-isolating.

The new case is the third confirmed in the past 48 hours after two women, in their 50s and 30s, tested positive on Wednesday. 

The woman in her 50s had recently returned to Australia from Pakistan. She had two negative results in Melbourne while in hotel quarantine, but subsequently tested positive 12 days after she arrived in South Australia on July 9. Spurrier says the woman had been in quarantine the entire time and was completely asymptomatic. She will remain in isolation for another 10 days as a precaution.

The second case is a woman in her 30s who had been quarantining in Adelaide after arriving from Mumbai on a repatriation flight on June 27. She also had two negative tests while in hotel quarantine, but had a family member who tested positive. A recent serology test revealed the woman was infected but, due to the time frame, her case is not considered active.

The state’s total now sits at 447 with two active cases.

 Inmate at Sydney jail tests positive for COVID-19 A jail in Sydney's north-west has been placed in lockdown after an inmate tested positive for COVID-19.

The inmate arrived at Parklea Correctional Centre on July 26 after he was refused bail for driving offences. He recently arrived in NSW from Victoria and had been in isolation at the facility.

"Preliminary contact tracing with staff and inmates has confirmed the inmate has not had any close contacts in custody, on being transported, or at Parklea Correctional Centre since his arrival, in accordance with the isolation protocols," a Corrective Services NSW spokesperson said.

The inmate was transferred to the NSW Corrective Services COVID-19 hospital at Silverwater upon returning a positive test.

The area in which the inmate was in isolation is being forensically cleaned and his family is being notified, the spokesperson said.

It is the first case of COVID-19 among staff or inmates in NSW's jails.

 Hypothetical person refuses to get tested, exhibits corona-virus symptoms. What should happen? Say hypothetically there is a person called Bob.

Bob exhibits COVID-19 symptoms, shortness of breath, sore throat, etc. But  Bob refuses to self-isolate. You also have a close relationship to Bob. 

Bob doesn't want to get tested because they don't want to be enforced into quarantine. Some have pointed out to Bob that they could potentially be infecting others, Bob doesn't take things very seriously anyway because Bob is young and immature. 

So today an ambulance where workers in COVID-19 PPE came to take one of the neighbors to the hospital (see image) below. Now an observer could speculate that Bob's sickness and the ambulance are either unrelated, or that they might be related. 

What would the optimal course of action be for a third party who is witnessing the situation?  Can they inform authorities of someone who may potentially have COVID-19 but isn't sure?
