 Tips for Safely Injecting Sunlight to Cure Covid 1. Use   only pure Sunlight. This is one time where you don't want it cut down   or diluted with cheap additives like Fluorescent or LED. If you have a   vampire around, test it first on them - if they burn up, then you know   you have the good stuff.
2. Make sure it has both UVA and UVB. ASK YOUR DEALER!
3. It's okay to share needles provided you push a bit of sunshine through after each injection.
4. Studies   have shown that singing John Denver songs increases the treatment   efficacy by approximately 34%. Strangely, the song itself doesn't seem   to matter.

Expect there   to be a shortage on pure sunlight in the coming weeks or months. And   there are some states, like Washington, where it might never be   available. But there are still things you can do.

1. If   you are lucky enough to have Full Spectrum Light Bulbs, these will  work  - though it may take several bulbs. If you can fit the bulb in  your  mouth - do so and turn them on for no less than 30 minutes. If  they will  not fit, you can crush them up and ingest them; but be aware  this is  far less effective.
2. It   is difficult to collect full sunlight but blind studies have show that   one of the most effective collectors happens to be the eyes. While the   sun is fully visible, stare at it for no less than 15 minutes and  repeat  as needed.
3. Small   amounts of concentrated sunlight can be smoked with good effect. Those   who have combined sunlight with marijuana seem to particularly enjoy  the  result.

As with any Covid-19 treatment, please contact your local politician to see if it is right for you.

EDIT  1: No, refracting light through your hoarded hand sanitizer will not  increase the efficacy of the sunlight. It may, however, kill some ants  depending on how the bottles are aimed. Which, I suppose, could be  helpful if the ants are carrying Covid 19.

EDIT 2: There is no evidence that ants carry or can pass on Covid 19.

EDIT  3: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, choro tibique deseruisse te cum, probo  meliore ius id, vix munere eripuit molestie an. Accusam signiferumque  his ei. No duo epicuri assentior, at ius eros elitr mollis. Cu mel posse  referrentur, an enim appetere quo, vel an recusabo tractatos. Per  audire necessitatibus cu, ne qui utamur intellegam.

 MINIMUM PRACTICAL PROTECTION for Businesses and Public Workers and PUBLIC If you interact commonly with the public, PLEASE PLEASE WEAR AN EFFECTIVE MASK. The only ones proven to work are rubber sealed FULL FACE MASKS, which protect your eyes as well as your breathing orifices. Goggles are impractical as they are extremely uncomfortable to seal with, and also non-swimming ones have holes that allow for ventilation.  


The ONLY filters that properly work are rated P2 or above, cartridge based, as you do not want to take chances with evaporated viruses floating in the air. They stay there for 3 hours at a time according to a study (google it).

You can buy the 3m 6800 here with P1 or something filters

or import Drager masks with a 26$ expired NBC P3 filter here

AVOID BUYING HALF CUPS. THEY ARE NOT EFFECTIVE. SURGICALS ARE PLACEBO. THERE IS NO SEAL AROUND THE NASAL RIDGE AND ON THE SIDE OF SURGICALS. 

PROTECT YOURSELF to PROTECT OTHERS. 

Remember how many people are asymptomatic, and the sky high longest incubation of 24 days.

Good luck mates.

 WHO - Water, sanitation, hygiene and waste management for COVID-19 My view on the concept of 'panic' is that a worrying behaviour is when you start speculating about worse case scenarios and reacting to baseless fears. It is not panic to pose a question and then seek out an answer to that question. 

I was down-voted quite a lot for hypothesising about why people are stressing about drinking water in the r/perth thread (someone was calling people ridiculous for stocking up on drinking water). In response I proposed that people may be concerned about water sanitation.

I though that this was interesting information on the topic:

The World Health Organization released a technical brief on Water, sanitation, hygiene and waste management for COVID-19. Be aware that when they say "no evidence to date", it means there is no research done... no one has actually tested the water. 

**Link to PDF**: [

"The risk of catching COVID-19 from the faeces of an infected person appears to be low. There is some evidence to indicate that COVID-19 may lead to intestinal infection and be present in faeces. Approximately 2-10% of cases with confirmed COVID-19 presented with diarrhoea and two studies reported detection of COVID-19 viral RNA fragments in faecal matter of COVID-19 patients. However, to date, only one study has cultured the COVID-19 virus from a single stool specimen. There have not been reports of fecal-oral transmission of COVID-19 to date".

"While there is no evidence, to date, on the COVID-19 virus survival in water or sewage, the virus is likely to become inactivated significantly faster than non-enveloped human enteric viruses with known waterborne transmission (e.g., adenovirus, norovirus, rotavirus and Hepatitis A). For example, one study found that human coronavirus survived only 2 days in dechlorinated tap water and hospital wastewater at 20 degrees C.  Other studies concur; noting that human coronavirus demonstrated a 99.9% die-off from 2 days  to 2 weeks at 23 degrees C and 25 degrees C, respectively. Heat, high or low pH, sunlight and common disinfectants (e.g. chlorine) all facilitate die-off."  


"The presence of the COVID-19 virus has not been detected in drinking-water supplies and based on current evidence the risk to water supplies is low.  While laboratory studies of surrogate coronaviruses taking place in well controlled environments indicate that the virus can remain infectious in fecally contaminated water for days to weeks. A number of measures can be taken to improve water safety starting with source water protection, treatment of water (at point of distribution, collection, or consumption), and safe storage of treated water in regularly cleaned and covered containers at home".

"It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems likely to behave like other coronaviruses."

So basically, there is evidence that the virus is present in fecal matter, however they have only been able to culture the virus from fecal matter from one stool sample. Viruses can survive on surfaces up to 9 days (in the best possible conditions of temperature and humidity) and will likely die in water in 20 minutes.

I would be interested to know how they would determine a fecal transmission as opposed to just assuming it was droplet transmission, if anyone has insight into this feel free to point me toward some reading.

 I feel like some people need a little reminder about cleaning products.... excuse the flair.. I put it as prepping/self protection, but for some reason it wouldn't let me post, yet again... mods please fix this issue!! In times like these, people will be more vigilant in cleaning their homes (floors, benches etc)... it doesn't help much that the majority of disinfectants and bleaches are running low, so people unfortunately think they can mix certain chemicals together in hopes it becomes stronger to kill all germs and  viruses. 

Please guys, be extra careful mixing the following: 

•Bleach and vinegar, produces chlorine gas, which can cause coughing, breathing problems, burning and watery eyes.
•Bleach and ammonia, it produces a toxic gas called chloramine. This causes shortness of breath and chest pain.
•Bleach and rubbing alcohol, it makes chloroform, which is highly toxic.
•Hydrogen peroxide and vinegar, this combination makes peracetic/peroxyacetic acid, which can be highly corrosive.

There are many places online that sell certain essential oils proven to kill germs, pure eucalyptus oil for example, buy in bulk and it actually works out cheaper if you use these with water. I buy a huge 5lt bottle and honestly clean my home top to bottom everyday and it lasts me a very long time (plus less plastic bottle wastage, less added chemicals and less shopping trips)

If you manage to find bleach, dilute it with water according to bottle instructions... just water -NOTHING ELSE, please!! 

Vinegar is OK to clean but not proven to kill germs

Invest in a quality steam mop (a multi use one that has the added handheld) steam clean benches, taps, handles and floors, then do wipe over with a disinfectant. 

Stay safe people. Remember, a healthy you and family, starts at home xXx 

Ps: if you are having trouble finding proper disinfectants, try your local NQR, i went in there today and they had almost 300 bottles of some eucalyptus type disinfectant, made in Australia too!

Also, many online cleaning wholesalers have bulk lots, 5lt, 20lt etc... Also try Bunnings, mitre 10, home hardware, and bargain shops ...
