 Thoughts on why masks do and don't work TLDR. I think masks are mainly a visible symptom of societies successful in suppressing Covid-19, not the reason for their success. But I think they do play an important psychological role in combating the virus by acting as a constant reminder of the pandemic. And that is why I personally choose to wear a mask.

A lot of people point out simple analogies like Taiwan (insert other successful country) with mask = success, USA (insert other failed country) without mask = failure and conclude that masks must have done it.

I think it is more complicated and that masks are just a symptom, not a cause of countries success in fighting the virus. To me, mask usage is an indicator of a society more toward the collectivist end on the individualism/collectivism spectrum.

Citizens in countries more of a culture of emphasis on the good of the many vs individual rights, are more likely to take steps to protect others and themselves such as staying home where possible, washing hands etc.

Because many believe masks help, that means many of them will wear masks as well. So the masks are just symptomatic of citizens taking steps for the greater good over their personal comfort.

Masks in and of themselves don't help since the virus is small enough to get through non N95 masks that are the majority of what people are wearing.

Yet I think the most important aspect of masks is the psychological effect they have. Admit it, if you are not wearing a mask and walk into a room full of people wearing surgical masks, your human instinct would automatically put you in danger mode. You would act more cautiously.

Masks are scary because they indicate the presence of an invisible threat and act as a constant reminder of the pandemic. It's human nature to tense up when seeing others wearing masks. This I think is one of the drivers of the political backlash to mask wearing. More individualistic people see masks as scary and a symbol of their lost freedoms and react by attacking the symbol.

So if there is a critical mass of mask wearing, then despite them being mere placebo for stopping the virus particles, they do have a very real psychological effect in reminding everyone to be cautious and washing hands, social distancing etc. I think people are a lot more likely to adhere to social distancing if they see a lot of people wearing masks than if they were not.

For this reason alone, I believe mask wearing should be strongly encouraged.

 Can we get masks with valves banned? Whenever I go out on public transport and into shops, etc, I diligently wear a mask. I totally but into the whole "a mask is now to protect others than to protect yourself" though clearly it offers some protection.

However, more and more I see others wearing masks with valves. It absolutely infuriates me! I mean, do they think they are helping? Do they think they are doing their civic duty and some how protecting the public? No! They are doing the most selfish thing possible saying "I want to maximise my own protection whilst doing nothing to stop my own virus laden breath passing virtually opposed though the valve in my selfish mask and infecting those around me".

I would rather see no mask at all than the utterly contemptible valve masks.

Mandate masks or don't - but I would like to see valve masks banned (unless one is actively performing an activity that calls for them - spray painting or whatever).

 Have anyone try this streamlined respirator and reusable filters? I have my RD 40mm respirators and filters (that makes me look like I'm cosplaying Metro) but recently, I've found [this respirator]( and supposedly N95 filters on eBay. Have anyone tried them? It can be a more sustainable option compared to disposable N95 masks that are being sold for 5 bucks per mask.

Also found: [here]( and [here](

This is not an advert. I am honestly curious about this Lianyou respirator. it cost about 26 bucks for a respirator + 10 filters and filters bought in bulk can be as cheap as 90 cents each.
