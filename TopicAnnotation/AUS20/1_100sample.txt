 Lowering restrictions seems a little sketchy The talk of, and planned lowering of restrictions seems a little sketchy.

The 140+ billion dollars is already spent, job keeper and job seeker payments are going out and will be for months to come. 

We're almost at single daily digits even another 14 days could possibly put us into low single digits. Why not just wait a couple more weeks at least? All the talk of lowering restrictions is going to give a lot of Australians a false sense of security and more social interaction will occur as a result, even before the restrictions are technically lowered. We've come so far why risk that. 

Just my 2 cents
