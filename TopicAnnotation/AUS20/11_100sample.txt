 Genuinely asking the question...If children are not considered “super spreaders” and are encouraged to go back to school by the PM, why are they still subject to social distancing measures? If they’re not high risk of contracting or spreading the disease, shouldn’t they be allowed to go to the beach, hang out at the mall and visit their grandparents? To be clear I’m not advocating these activities for kids, but trying to make sense of back-to-school vs home-iso. Link to Qld gov official advice below. 

Text taken from 

“Are children ‘super-spreaders’ of the coronavirus?
While we all know kids, especially younger ones, are not great at keeping their hands and bodily fluids to themselves at the best of times, there is so far no evidence to suggest they are so-called super-spreaders of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (COVID-19). Some asymptomatic (showing no signs or symptoms) infections have occurred in children but it’s too early to say how often this occurs. However, almost all the reported infections in children have been traced to an adult in the same household. This suggests that children have been infected by close prolonged contact with adults and not by contact with other children.
While it’s important to note there is still some uncertainty around the role children play in the transmission of COVID-19, it is most likely that children, with mostly mild or asymptomatic infections are not very effective spreaders of the virus. Of course, this risk can be reduced even further with careful attention to hand hygiene and cleaning, particularly in children who may have symptoms.”

 WA schools to cease formal classes on April 3  

WA Premier Mark McGowan says from now until next Friday, all children who attend public schools will continue to be taught.  
 

&gt;*"However, the State Government encourages families to keep their children at home if they can access the online or other resources for the education of their children to continue.*   
   
*"Children of people who need their children to attend school, to enable them to maintain employment and those children in vulnerable families, like children living with grandparents, are encouraged to attend school. Formal classes will now finish at the end of Friday, April 3."*

He says arrangements will be in place in schools to supervise children who need to attend school on the last four days prior to Easter.  Education Minister Sue Ellery says students who stay at home will be required to use online learning. 

&gt;*"In the week of the 6th of  April, teachers and education assistants and other school staff begin the preparation for what education in a combination of physical school settings and distance and online education will look like in term 2.*  
   
*"Students who attend, again, because their parents need them to attend so they can maintain their jobs, will be supervised, not taught.*  
   
*"Schools will continue to manage vulnerable staff members, no students will be turned away from schools if they attend."*

 Unpopular Opinion: Schools don't need to close! People are circle jerking that schools need to close just because every country is doing it but there are consequences for this, we are talking about first and foremost low socioeconomic students where school is the only place where they can get basic needs covered, then we need to think of people who work in essential services who will be forced to stay home because the kids have to stay home which in turn would lead, for example, the capacity for the healthcare system to handle any substantial increase in cases. I believe that schools will close eventually, but it needs to be graded. e.g introduce screening at schools, kids  at risk are identified and not allowed entry to the school and if there is a confirmed case, then the school closes down, no need to close down the whole school system in the whole continent just because johnny in a small school in suburban bondi contracted corona.

 Surely school closures mean that we're going for elimination... If not, why are they closed? Sitting here in Victoria on another beautiful lockdown winter's day there is one thing I find thoroughly bemusing about this supposed "suppression strategy".  Given our state CMO is quoted that he would "love elimination" that seems like prima facie bullshit. Our deputy federal CMO uses the word, but calls it "aggressive supression". Well it's certainly aggressive something.

Anyway, if they won't come out and say it, then surely the re-closure of Victorian primary schooling blows a gaping hole the so called suppression narrative. Either that, or they truly don't have an idea as to what they are doing.

**Ummm, guys, the data is in about schools...**

Aside from hysterical headlines about school clusters here in Australia, the data has been in on  schooling and school aged children as a driver of the pandemic for a long time now.

From the journal *Pediatrics* July '20 *-* [COVID-19 Transmission and Children: The Child Is Not to Blame](

&gt;Almost 6 months into the pandemic, accumulating evidence and collective experience argue that children, particularly school-aged children, are far less important drivers of SARS-CoV-2 transmission than adults. Therefore, serious consideration should be paid toward strategies that allow schools to remain open, even during periods of COVID-19 spread. In doing so, we could minimize the potentially profound adverse social, developmental, and health costs that our children will continue to suffer...

We've being seeing this in Europe since way back in March... [

&gt;Within families, the virus is mainly transmitted from adults to children. Children are sometimes infected with the virus, but less often than adults. There were no families in which a child under 12 years old was the first patient in the family.

Same for Iceland in April... [

&gt;Children under 10 are less likely to get infected than adults and if they get infected, they are less likely to get seriously ill. What is interesting is that even if children do get infected, they are less likely to transmit the disease to others than adults. We have not found a single instance of a child infecting parents.

How about when Finland reopened schools in April?  [

&gt;“When investigating chains of transmission, it has been found that children clearly are infected less often than adults, and chains of transmission have rarely started with a child. In light of this information, the risk of large-scale spread of the coronavirus in contact teaching is low. However, it is likely that some coronavirus infections will be diagnosed among those in contact teaching.”

What about Denmark, the first country in Europe to reopen schools and childcare?  [

&gt;“You cannot see any negative effects from the reopening of schools,” Peter Andersen, doctor of infectious disease epidemiology and prevention at the Danish Serum Institute

**So, what are we doing exactly?**

Obviously you could argue that we're going for elimination, so therefore the schools are closed until we have no cases. That would be a coherent action with such a strategy. Otherwise, what exactly is the government doing shutting down schools under a "suppression strategy"?

I contend we may actually have the worst of all situations...  no real strategy combined with the willingness to simply throw away one of the most valuable pillars of our society for no real gain.

 Schools and Carriers Unley High School in SA had a teacher and student test positive to Coronavirus - 5-7 days ago.

At the time, we were told that the student was isolated at home by the parents. The school was closed temporarily and cleaned anyway, and reopened 24 hours later.

I just saw on ABC news that another student was also infected and went on a CAMPING TRIP with 60 other students.

Right now, 110 students from Unley High School are in self-isolation.

Unley High School is now forced to close and students are working from home.

If we think that we are going to beat this virus by keeping kids at school, we are a deluded society.

 Private school funding under threat if schools close against government advice on coronavirus  

Prime Minister Scott Morrison has warned independent schools their funding might be at risk if they defy government advice and close due to the COVID-19 threat.

Mr Morrison spoke to school leaders on Wednesday, including the head of the Australian Independent Schools NSW Geoff Newcombe.

 

Dr Newcombe subsequently sent a letter to all his members about the conversation, in which Mr Morrison "reminded me that in this situation there were certain expectations attached to the recurrent funding provided by the Australian Government to Catholic and independent schools.

"He asked if I would convey this message to schools in our association, as well as colleagues in other states and territories."

State and federal governments are trying to maintain unity over keeping schools open, a difficult situation when there are three sectors, and in one of those, the independent sector, each school is individually run.

The major private schools in Sydney are sticking to government advice to keep schools open in the face of pressure from some parents. One head said only a handful of parents were lobbying for the school to shut, but they were very vocal.

Kambala, PLC Croydon, Pymble Ladies College and Moriah College have all announced they are bringing learning online. Some will keep a skeleton staff on campus for students without supervision.

 [The Archbishop of Sydney stepped in]( on Wednesday morning to stop the entire NSW Catholic system from closing, ordering the state's 11 dioceses to follow government advice and stay open. 

Health authorities say there is little benefit to closing schools at this stage, and substantial risk the virus will spread further if children are sent out into the community.

They also warn of massive economic repercussions.

 Schools need to close  

I teach over 200 kids a day (sometimes more) in a school of about 1000 (wow, that's over 500). Now, this is just my little rant about the issue of keeping public schools open and by no means is it actually guided by scientific studies. It is purely my opinion and there could many flaws and no one might even read this. However, I feel that teachers have little say and we all feel the fear of speaking out (but thank you teacher's federation for your efforts).

The arguments about keeping schools open are just plain dumb. Schools aren't just made up of children, there are teachers, cleaners, general assistants and office staff and more. Ask any of us and we will tell you that a school is the perfect place to spread germs (the flu gets spread at least once a year in a school; no it's not scientific, it's just based on experience).

Now the government's main issue for keeping schools open is that it's safer?

\- Children will run around and spread covid-19 to the public by hanging out in big groups at the park and shopping centres? How is that any different to before and after school? Do we not trust that our children and parents of the children to keep them at home as if they were at school? Are they rabid animals who hang around in gangs of 30 and terrorise everyone around them with the threat of viruses by coughing and sneezing on people?

\- They need supervision/ parents can't all stay home to look after them. Well Sherlock, some parents are at home already and some have been sent home. Schools should be left open for kids who have no other options (no parents /no access to technology/HSC related work that needs face to face instruction or the like). Not only does this cut down on numbers, it means that any kid walking around in public should be at home or at school just like any other school day. This isn't a holiday. This is a lockdown.

\- Children don't apparate into school. They walk or take public transport. Some travel a fair distance. Just because a kid is at school, doesn't mean that they're never out in public. Kids dominate public transport before and after school (I apologise to the public in advance) and now we've increased the number of people who are in the line of exposure. Well done.

\- Big companies such as CBA, Telstra, Macquarie, NBN, Tabcorp and many more, have sent their non-essential staff to work from home because they understand that it reduces the chances of spreading. They haven’t closed nor have they continued at 100% load. Why can’t schools do the same??? No more than 500 people in a gathering (haha, have you been in a public school before?). What a joke.

Now I know that there are some parents who are wanting their kids at school and there are definitely parents who aren't able to stay home to look after young children. However, this is a pandemic. We are trying to limit the numbers of people catching this NOT BECAUSE THEY WILL DIE but because THEY WILL SPREAD IT. Schools should stay open for only the absolutely essential kids with no face to face teaching but just supervision for them to do their work and otherwise, there needs to be arrangements made for kids to not be in large class groups (1.5metres apart. Ha. Good one. Have you met children? Have you seen schools?)

Tl;dr Schools are over 500 people. Close them.

 "The Health Advice" - Australian Health Protection Principal Committee advice on schools I just wanted to post this here because I keep hearing "the health advice" from Scomo, but no useful detail. This is the AHPPC statement from 22 March:

[

Specifically: 

&gt;AHPPC does not support the closure of schools given the lack of  evidence of significant disease in children and the lack of reported  major disease spreading in schools. Furthermore, the closure of schools  poses a major risk to children's education, mental health and wellbeing,  particularly those from low socioeconomic regions, where schools  provide an important environment for nurturing and learning.  The impact  on the critical workforce and potential exposure of elderly relatives  caring for children is also of significance.  School closure would  achieve some degree of additional social distancing but the evidence of  its benefit at this stage is minimal.  AHPPC views schools as an  essential service and strongly supports keeping schools open.  
&gt;  
&gt;There are significant opportunities to improve social distancing  within schools, and we will continue to work to provide advice to the  sector.  AHPPC will continue to review developing evidence regarding the  effect of the disease in children and the role of children in the  transmission of the virus.  
&gt;  
&gt;School closures are likely to be more effective when approaching the  peak of the epidemic and enforced for a shorter period. If there is a  strong desire to close schools at this later stage, it is essential that  an option is provided for children of essential service providers, such  as health care workers, to attend school or be otherwise cared for.   
&gt;  
&gt;AHPPC notes one state has elected to bring forward their Easter school holidays.

The public primary school informed parents via email that NSW Health had closed Willoughby Girls High “until further notice” and that they could pick their children up if they were concerned about the spread of the virus.

“I was a bit worried when the school told us that Willoughy Girls had been closed down because of the coronavirus,” she said. “I think it’s better to be safe than sorry"

 Hunter schools enforce social distancing as teacher is exposed 

&gt;A NEWCASTLE Grammar School teacher has self-isolated after their friend was found to have COVID-19.

&gt;Head of School Erica Thomas wrote to parents on Sunday to tell them the year six teacher had come into contact with a confirmed case. The school is following NSW Health advice.

&gt;Ms Thomas told the Newcastle Herald the teacher was in Sydney last week with friends, including one who was confirmed on Saturday to have COVID-19.

&gt;"The teacher had contact with students and staff last week and had no idea he had come into contact with the virus the weekend before," Ms Thomas said.


&gt;"The teacher continues to exhibit no symptoms.

&gt;"We have cleaned all areas the teacher was in thoroughly, communicated directly with parents of the students he was most in contact with, phoned any parent where we knew the child or parent might because of other health complications be concerned, and informed staff."

&gt;Schools across the Hunter - including Newcastle Grammar - started rolling out social distancing measures on Monday, such as staggering break times and cancelling a range of events, from assemblies to sports carnivals, excursions, parent teacher interviews, Harmony Day and Easter hat parades.

&gt;"The school in the modern era has never dealt with a health crisis of this magnitude"," Ms Thomas said.

&gt;"As a community we need to protect those that are most at risk - while younger people seem to be less impacted if they contract the virus - we don't want to be responsible for passing it on to their grandparents."

The practicality of social distancing in a school setting and the question of school closures aside: community transmission in this context is a thing that we don't seem to be taking seriously enough at all.  Or in any context really.

 COVID-19, children, and schools: overlooked and at risk  "It is widely thought that children are much less susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection than adults and do not play a substantial role in transmission. However, emerging research suggests this perception is unfounded. Seroprevalence and contact tracing studies show children are similarly vulnerable and transmit the virus to a meaningful degree. Research suggesting otherwise is hampered by substantial bias. Additionally, large clusters in school settings have been reported, with implications for the control of community transmission. Risk-reduction strategies must be implemented in schools as a matter of urgency. "

“The number of schools in Victoria that are closed after being linked with recent positive cases of coronavirus grew to more than 80 on Wednesday, with Strathcona Girls' Grammar in Canterbury, Mac Robertson Girls' College in Melbourne, Aquinas College in Ringwood, Presentation College Windsor and three schools in greater Bendigo among the new closures.

Many schools on the list have been closed for more than a week, waiting for an increasingly drawn-out contact tracing process to play out.”

This is a joke - 80 schools closed and done waiting more than a week for contact tracing to even start.

 It's a start, 'Victorian public school students to be kept home for two days' 


Victorian public school students will be asked to stay home for two days to allow teachers to prepare to run classes remotely, in case the coronavirus pandemic escalates.

Schools were told late on Friday that the last day of term one (next Friday) and the first day of term two would be pupil-free days.

During those two days, teachers will finalise preparations to run classes remotely should schools shut down at the peak of the pandemic.

"Teachers and schools are working hard to prepare for the possibility that we will need to move at some stage to more flexible learning arrangements, including remote learning," Dr David Howes, Education Department deputy secretary said in a notice to public schools.

This will provide an important opportunity for schools to consolidate their preparations."

Dr Howes said schools were already prepared to teach remotely but "it won't always be perfect, and we will learn as we go".

Principals have also been asked to support vulnerable teachers and staff who need to work from home to minimise their exposure.

The notice, seen by The Age, repeated that schools would be open next week as anxiety about spreading the coronavirus within schools festered.

On Thursday, Victoria's Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton said schools needed to remain open this early in the outbreak

There is not widespread community transmission at this point, and levels of COVID-19 illness are likely to be very low," Dr Sutton said.

"Children who are at all unwell are advised to be at home, and schools and teachers should exclude any unwell children who present to school. Any children with undetected symptoms are likely to be minimally infectious.

"The evidence is reviewed daily and advice will continue to be tailored to the evidence."

Earlier on Friday, it was revealed NAPLAN tests had been canned for the year. The tests – taken annually by children in years 3, 5, 7 and 9 – will resume next year.

The news came as a senior boarder at Geelong Grammar at the Corio campus was diagnosed with coronavirus.

Five school parents have also tested positive, having attended a cocktail night for parents of year 9 students at the Timbertop campus.

 Online high school tutoring I don't know if this is appropriate or not, so feel free to delete:  


I'm a VCE Chemistry tutor, currently studying science and engineering at a university in Melbourne. I know that a lot of kids are being pulled out of school, and some of my students schools are imminently closing.   
If you, or your children would like lessons, I can offer to do online classes for them over video chat (I don't necessarily have to see the child, but they will see me). I have a valid Working With Childrens card. 

I'm just throwing my hat in there, to see if this is something that people might think is helpful with all the school closures/keeping kids out of school. Learning must go on if possible, and we have the technological resources to do so.

I can also offer some math tutoring, or even junior and middle high school tutoring.  
Please message me if you've got any questions, and we can see if we can arrange something.  
Thanks!

 School Closures If school closures are to happen soon, roughly and realistically how long do you guys reckon they going to be closed? Will the department wait until the peak of the virus has passed?

 NSW/Sydney parents: are you keeping your kids home from school tomorrow? Interested to know how many families are planning to keep their kids home starting tomorrow, or are planning to before official school closures are announced? I’ve spoken to a few other mums from our school today, they’re sending their kids but don’t want to. They’re worried about it, but want to abide by the “rules” and wait for official school closures. A few are thinking of pulling their kids out before the end of the week though. Are you keeping your kids home tomorrow?

 "Children are not giving this disease to their parents, the parents are giving to it the children." - QLD CMO Queensland's chief medical officer Jeanette Young has been quoted as saying: 

&gt; Looking at the evidence, we have not seen outbreaks in schools, we haven’t seen them in Australia, we haven’t seen them overseas.

&gt; Where children have got it, when we’ve worked back through how they got it, they got it from their parents.

&gt; Children are not giving this disease to their parents, the parents are giving to it the children. 

&gt; This is not flu.

&gt; This is not a flu, it is a coronavirus. Totally different.

 Covid legislation - Removal of children. Can anyone clarify when this would be used. Is it only referring to children in custody of the state? Example: foster home or any child in any dwelling? What right does this take away from the parent.

 I'm in Melbourne and just heard that a large school with close links to my child's will be closed tomorrow Some parents in our school's group have shared the other school's email notification (they have kids at both).  I might post but I really don't know how to without it being identifying.  Not sure if it's in the news yet.

The gist of the email is that a school community member is showing symptoms after being in contact with an infected person.  The school will remain closed tomorrow while they asses the situation.

It's getting a little too close to my family now.

 Lessons from history So chatting with elderly parents today. Finally learned why father was never christened. There was a polio epidemic in the late 1930s. No large gatherings and schools closed. (According to family memory). Polio has a r0 of 5-7. Obviously covid 19 varies but seems to be at least 1-3. Higher if it gets out of control.
Interesting that we could close schools at that time (and yes I realise life was v different back then regarding likelihood of both parents working).

 Realistically will schools be on come Monday next week. I’m just curious as I have many assessments due then and wondered if they’d be done in school or possibly after the school holidays.

 Schools Open For Infection!!!! Discussion/Rant ***One Day Is All It Takes.***

Our PM is not looking after school staff or Australia's children.

By saying if you have a job, you can send your child to school for the economy's sake is ridiculous. A lot of children at school do not take this pandemic seriously they don't understand the implications of this virus.

Children do not show the symptoms as much as others, if any at all.

most families I can say consist of two children if one child were to contract COVID-19 theres 14 days of glorious incubation time where symptoms may not show. during this time should your child be attending school ( say they are in year 2) they will sit with their 20 odd classmates where social distancing is not possible due to small classrooms. during lunch they tend to spend 15+ mins during lunch and recess playing with children from other classes, maybe friends up one grade or down a grade. then your child will go home after 6 hours of crowded contact with their classmates. and spend time with their sibling that doesn't have COVID-19 yet. They spend well over 15+min together playing/fighting whatever most siblings do at home. Now your year 5 child starts spreading the virus to her class for 13 days.

Now COVID-19 has a nice trip home with other students and families.

The Australian Average School size is about 470 students plus 40+ school staff. the average household as of 2016 is 2.6 (let round that to 3).

1530 people now have to be quarantined, as **SCHOOL STAFF CANNOT CONFIRM WHO HAS BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THAT CHILD FOR 15 + MINUTES OVER THE LAST 14 DAYS.**

Yet Scomo says, let close play lands and birthday parties, no more than 10 in a space. while classrooms are double that.

Personally we are f\*&amp;(ed.

 Any Word Whether Or Not Scott Morrison's Children Are Still Attending School? After Morrison's address yesterday where he stated he felt safe sending his kids to school, as a father I was naturally curious as to whether or not he was *actually* sending his kids school. Other than the fact that his kids attend a private Baptist school in Sidney, the details of his children's schooling isn't available online (nor should it be), but I was wondering if anyone has any info as to whether or not his children's school is a) still open, and b) if they're attending.

I've found his completely illogical justification for putting our children at the frontline of his 'herd immunity' strategy to be absolutely reprehensible, and would very much like to know if he's putting his (children's) money where his mouth is.

Not looking for specifics with regard to locations or school names, just whether or not he has his kids in school at this point in time.

 Can someone answer this question about asymptotic carriers? Can someone answer this:

If child A gets the virus from their parents and hangs out with child B, and Child B goes home back to their family with the virus - does the virus magically disappear or does the family that interact with child B get the virus?

 Please stop sending your son or daughter to school NOW Now is the time to act. Countries are closing down schools every second. The UK closed all their schools indefinitely. Our Prime Minister is slack idiot who wants to keep schools open just because of his own daughters. **He will close schools only if his daughters get the coronavirus.**

This idiot (ScoMo) follows Singapore‘s advice, a tiny little island nation that has only 25 schools (Primary and High combined) nationwide, while Australia has 10,607 schools (Primary and High Combined).  


As a former teacher and a former advisor to an Education minister, I can tell you it is certainly NOT okay to send your kids to school.    
Many parents and guardians are withdrawing their children from school every day. Join them. Phone, text or send an email to the school and education department that you are worried about your child’s safety.

And make sure you 🖕Scott Morrison for keeping schools open and risking children’s safety just to save the economy, when everyone knows that it will go into a recession anyway.

And there are plenty of online teaching and tutoring services online to continue learning such as zoom.us
