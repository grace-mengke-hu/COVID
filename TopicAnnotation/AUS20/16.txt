 Is anyone else still isolating? I'm in Melbourne and our family are still isolating including continuing to homeschool children. Would love to discuss with others in the same situation.

Any friends or family I've discussed with thinks we're nuts. Are we the only ones?

 Isolation from family members at home while waiting for test results Had myself tested a couple of days ago as I developed some minor symptoms and still awaiting the results. Wanted to keep my family safe so I tried having social distancing at home and putting on a mask when I’m with the rest of the family except meals, where I sat further away from them. It’s weird. It felt so strange and alienated even though we were all together in the same house. Did anyone else tried isolating from family and experience the same while waiting for your results?

 Other Individuals More Vulnerable To Serious Complications From COVID-19 include those on Opioids, Individuals with Diabetes Mellitus, Cerebrovascular disease, Hypertension, and Coronary Heart Disease It's not only those over 65 who are 'at risk' of contracting COVID-19 and developing much more serious and severe symptoms from the virus but individuals with chronic pain conditions who are taking prescribed opioid for these conditions, according to GP's. Unfortunately, many Australians who are currently taking these medications are not aware how they compromise their immune system - not to mention other organs and bodily functions over time - and may not be aware they're in the same group as those over 65 regarding COVID-19.

Other individuals who are more susceptible to developing serious complications from COVID-19 include those who have diabetes mellitus which is estimated to be 1.2 million people (5.1% of the population) - and those are those who have been officially diagnosed with diabetes, not accounting for those with the condition who are unaware they have it. Then, according to the Lancet, there's adults who have cerebrovascular diseases, hypertension, and coronary heart disease. - [ 

Considering the large numbers of Australians who have been diagnosed with one or more of these health conditions, such as diabetes mellitus and/or hypertension (two conditions often comorbid) as well as coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease, as well as those taking prescribed opioids, it makes one wonder at the actual percentage of the population that should be added to those over 65 when considering who is more inclined to develop serious complications if they contract the coronavirus? It is thought-provoking, to say the least. 

If you read this and know someone with one or more of these conditions, let them know about the Lancet article concerning this matter. It does not mention those on opioids - for that they need to talk to their GP and it's not advisable to suddenly cease such medications considering not only the side-effects of sudden cessation but the increase in chronic pain, also. Nevertheless, it is prudent for anyone taking opioids or who knows someone who is to let them know these drugs decrease the body's natural immune response, to therefore take especial precautions to try to guard against any infectious conditions whether the 'common cold', seasonal influenza, or COVID-19.

 For all those people who are demanding we close our schools. How are we going to make sure that the kids are being looked after? I've been trying to do research and get a feel for this as much as I can but I'm really not in the position to say. We don't have any kids just yet. While I think from one point of view it would be a great benefit to close the schools in an effort to flatten the curve I'm wondering from a logistical point of view how we would get all those dual income families to look after their children.

Going off some numbers I got from here: [ more than two thirds of households are dual income families with children under 18. I understand this will include young children who are in childcare but it is what it is. Ultimately we should all be working from home, so I guess there should be someone at home to make sure your kids are remaining at home. 

For those households where both parents are unable to work from home, who is going to look after their children? Do you think one person will take leave and remain at home? Are we going to ask grandparents to come look after them? I was reading that the CDC was using this exact example as why they don't want to close schools. This would raise the number of older, more vulnerable people being exposed to the virus when they should really be staying at home practising good social distancing measures.

I guess the main reason for this post was to get different perspectives on this issue. I'm pretty much cooped up at home as I imagine a lot of us are and I have no one else to really ask. A good comment from  u/shengbat in another thread about why they didn't enforce the mass gathering "ban" straight away gave me pause for thought and ultimately I was less stressed/angry about the whole situation. I think we all would be better off if we were less stressed.

 Store Report - definite uptick in buying Took a trip to Coles on Northern Beaches and there is a significant uptick in the volume of buying.

All the usual is gone. No toilet paper, sanitizer, wipes etc.

Pasta is low, rice very low, cans not so much but still lower than normal.

Looking at trolleys everyone has more than what I would call a usual amount of food, especially of the above mentioned items

 If I'm not allowed to leave the house except for the essentials, how can stores like JBHiFi still be open? lots of stores are still open even though people are not meant to leave their houses except for essential things like food, medical, work, etc but then how are stores still open, are they just expecting people to break the rules?

 Does anybody actually know anyone who has Coronavirus? I am asking specifically like a family member, close friend, co-worker. Not your best friends aunties 3rd cousins babysitter who lives overseas somehwere or a facebook friend. Someone you would see on a sort of regular basis in Australia. 

There are about 20k subscribers here but i bet none of them have had covid or would be lucky to even know someone who has had it let alone died from it.
