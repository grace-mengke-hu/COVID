 Airport work I work at an airport in Australia, I have 6-7 weeks of annual leave before I go leave without pay, hpw long do you think the airport will suffer until it goes back to atleast semi normal operation? Should I start looking for another job now? 

I cannot go without pay, is this an overreaction?

 What is the goal of this lockdown and whats the long term plan? Im from Melbourne &amp; I want to know what the plan is after this lockdown? Have I missed something on the news? 
What are we working towards exactly? cause I dont have a clue.
I understand we need to get the numbers down and it will be awhile before we see the effects of that reflect in the daily case numbers but this lockdown has less restrictions than the last ( I think it needs to be stricter) and even if we get the cases low again to ease restrictions wont the case numbers just increase again? 
Is there a long term plan goal here, or are we just going to keep locking down  until/ if  we get a vaccine?

 How to get r/coronavirus news from Europe (Firstly - I only joined reddit in January, so my epiphany might be obvious to 99% of you)

There is no r/coronaviruseurope and I've had various discussions over the last 6 months about how to get r/coronavirus news from Europe (because I keep being frustrated that r/coronavirus is completely dominated by news from the USA).

My epiphany is that you go to r/coronavirus and click on the **Europe** flair (Ditto the **world** flair, etc)  

Thank you reading my rant/epiphany  (-:

 A question for everyone baying for tough punishment of those testing positive It's been impossible to ignore the intensity and pitch with which people (and the media) are calling for tough(er) punishment of people who have tested positive and aren't found to be at home when called on. 

Why will people continue to go get tested in an environment of fear of retribution? 

I'm sure there are people already making that decision and this would only make it worse. Is the goal to identify and control COVID or have it silently spread in the community... because I think it's clear which outcome we'll achieve through the punishment approach.

 Just got banned from r/Australia for posting that NZ was shutting schools &amp; going into lockdown. Are they allowing nothing covid-19 on there or something? I didn’t make any political commentary just posted link to NZ Herald newspaper.

 What is happening in off-shore detention centers regarding Coronavirus? Any news about its effect in places like Manus island or Naru?

 Any other supermarket staff here? Hi guys, I work in a major supermarket and am currently feeling very let down and unsafe at work. Is there anyone else in this position as I would love to discuss. 

I do not feel as though the measures in place are enough (social distancing is not being enforced in the slightest), and I live with my family who have raised concerns about me going to work. At this point I am tempted to quit but also feel selfish considering how many people have lost their jobs to this crisis.

 Wtf people? So I’ve had a shot of scotch and I’m tired and exhausted so rant coming.

I work in healthcare, which is fine. I chose those job, I don’t need special treatment. But what I do need is a little faith restored in humanity.

Over the las few weeks I have been disgusted with the behaviour of the general population.

This every man for himself, the entitlement, the acts of violence and aggression towards those that are in the same boat or worse off.

We have had medical equipment stolen in large quantities by the general public. They walk in, take an entire box of gowns off the wall and walk out, we have had to cable tie out hand sanitiser, masks, gowns, toilet paper and other protective equipment so that people (it’s not just one or two, it’s to the point that we are unable to replenish the stock) can have this shit sit at home hoarded, not being used by the people who need it, the people at risk, vulnerable etc.

And really, we can’t blame the government, we knew the numbers, the transmission rates globally, we are fucking adults, we should not have to be told to stay the fuck at home.

People continue to take more than they need so the elderly an vulnerable are left without.

Cashiers are treated with violence and abuse, and for what? They are human beings going through the same panic and fear the rest of us have.

We’ve lots jobs, any sense of security and still people continue to fight for their own self.

It’s fucked. 

The food shortage and toilet paper shortage was caused because people wanted to hoard for themselves. Those vulnerable that can’t afford it are fucked because people don’t care.
And now the shops are trying desperately to keep up.

We are all human. Even the government, this is not something we were really prepared for and arguing about that is a waste of time.

This is when we should pull together, not argue about “the Government didn’t tell us to stay inside, or not go to gatherings” we are all adults, we need to start taking accountability for our own actions.

To be honest, if I believed in a God who controlled our existence, I’d have no reason to give them as to why we shouldn’t be wiped out. Our behaviour, on a whole is reprehensible.

It’s not just Australia, it’s world wide, and I feel it’s probably worse in other countries, but this should be the shake up we need. To look after each other, to stop with the every person for himself. To look after each other and our world.

Not only have I been looking after people with respiratory issues, but I’ve also had people who have been on the receiving end of violence, in particular cashiers, retail people, etc. I’ve looked after older people who are hungry and going without because their neighbours won’t even offer to drop off a meal or something. 

I’ve seen people abused and threatened with violence about things they have no control over.

I hear random acts of support and help, but overwhelmingly, it’s the violence and selfishness that I see and and deal with. Hourly, not just daily.

I don’t want special treatment, I just want people to be nice to each other.

And when people offer support, stop complaining it’s not enough.

It doesn’t have to be over the top, just a meal here or there, offer to pick up a couple of things if you they are out, and stop abusing the cashiers and stealing medical supplies.

And stay the fuck at home unless it’s for necessities.

And for gods sake, wash your hands and practice personal hygiene!

 Will concerts happen in 2020? I was looking at a list of concerts that have been cancelled/postponed in 2020 and was surprised to see that Harry Styles is still planning to go ahead.  I have tickets to one of the Brisbane concerts, which also requires me to travel from NSW, and I assumed that it would be postponed until next year. Is the Queensland government even allowing such large gatherings before the end of the year?

 Halloween in Victoria and NSW: how to transmit lollies and not disease #Victoria

27 October 2020 | Source: [DHHS](

##Key messages

This Halloween there are some actions you can take to keep your friends, family and community safe, while still enjoying yourself.

- If you have any symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19) get tested and stay at home. By staying at home this Halloween, you help to keep your friends, family and community safe. 
- Wear a face mask with your costume, but remember that a costume mask that is part of your Halloween costume is not a substitute for a face mask. Consider making your own mask and decorating it.
- Keep at least 1.5 metres between yourself and people you don’t live with. This means no hugging or kissing when greeting people. Don’t share food or drinks.

##Trick or Treating

While we can’t celebrate in the normal ways we would, there are alternative options  

- Have a Halloween party outside in a public place. You can catch up with a group of up to ten people (including yourself). Babies under 12 months age aren’t included in the ten-person limit. An outdoor public place means an area accessible to everyone, including local parks and beaches.
- Do a Halloween scavenger hunt by giving children a list of Halloween-themed things to look for as they walk outdoors from house to house admiring Halloween decorations at a distance. Just like eye-spy! The limit of ten people (including yourself) applies to scavenger hunts. 
- Carve or decorate pumpkins with members of your household.
- Decorate your house.
- Have a virtual costume party or party with friends and family on video chat. 
- Have a Halloween movie night with your household. 
- Create an around the house trick or treat or scavenger hunt for your household.

##Handing out lollies or candy

Coronavirus is still with us and celebrating at home is the safest way to mark Halloween this year. If you do trick or treat, you need to stay safe. It is safer not to hand out lollies or candy to trick-or-treaters this Halloween. This is because the virus can spread on surfaces, including food or packaging. 

Under current restrictions traditional trick or treating where you knock on someone’s door is not permitted. If you can’t resist handing out lollies this year you can do so by having candy available outside of your home. 

- Don’t use communal bowls for lollies or candy. Putting lollies in a shared bowl will mean everyone is touching the same food and surfaces which isn’t safe. 
- Instead, put individually wrapped lollies or candy in bags for non-contact collection.
- Place bags on your fence, at your front gate or outside your home for collection.
- Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds before preparing the bags or individually wrapped lollies or candy.

##COVID-safe Halloween advice

NSW Health supports individuals participating in COVID-safe Halloween celebrations, providing levels of community transmission remain low and participants follow current rules when gathering together. Help us stop the spread this Halloween and always remember to:

* Keep 1.5 metres apart
* Practise good hand hygiene
* Stay home and get tested immediately if unwell
* Wear a face mask if unable to physically distance

##COVID-safe tips if you plan to hand out treats

NSW Health recommends:

* If you have any symptoms of COVID-19 over Halloween, stay home, don’t receive Halloween visitors and get tested immediately
* If you are self-isolating, don’t answer the door to trick-or-treaters
* Make it a front-yard event, not at the front-door of your house. Keep your celebrations outdoors and get creative in decorating the front yard
* Only hand out individually wrapped treats
* Don’t use communal lolly bowls. Consider other ways of distributing treats such as hanging them individually on your fence, front gate or up your driveway
* Offer hand sanitiser at your front gate or fence
* You may wish to avoid people knocking on your door by putting up a sign that says “We are home but due to COVID-19, we are distancing. Please take one, Happy Halloween”
* Remember, you can only have 20 people on your property at one time.

##COVID-safe tips if you plan to trick-or-treat

NSW Health recommends:

* If you have any symptoms of COVID-19 this Halloween, stay home and give trick-or-treating a miss this year. Get tested immediately
* Keep it local by staying in your suburb rather than going to well-known “treat streets” that attract crowds
* Celebrate outside, don’t go to people’s front door
* Stay in small household groups (for example a supervising adult and children from the same household) rather than groups of young people together. Remember, no more than 30 people can gather outside in a public place
* Stay 1.5 meters away from people you don’t live with
* Only take treats that are individually wrapped
* Use a disposable bag to collect your treats, and dispose of it appropriately afterwards
* Don’t share your treats with others from different households
* Don’t share costumes or costume face masks
* Carry hand sanitiser with you and use it often, especially after touching common surfaces.
