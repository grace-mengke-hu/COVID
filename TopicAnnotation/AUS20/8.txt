 PM Press Release: Pandemic leave disaster payment for South Australia 23 Oct 2020

*Prime Minister, Minister for the National Disability Insurance Scheme, Minister for Agriculture Drought and Emergency Management*

\--

The Australian Government has extended Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment arrangements in place with Victoria, New South Wales, Western Australia and Tasmania following agreement with the South Australian Government. The Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment is a lump sum payment to help an individual during the 14 day self-isolation, quarantine or caring period.

The agreement will see the Commonwealth Government extend the $1,500 Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment to South Australian workers who cannot earn an income because they must self-isolate, quarantine or care for someone with COVID-19.

If an individual is instructed by a health official to self-isolate or quarantine, and they have used up all appropriate leave entitlements, including any special pandemic leave, they may be eligible to make a claim. They may also be eligible if they’re the parent or guardian of a child aged 16 or under who has been instructed to isolate as they are a close contact or has tested positive for COVID-19, or they’re caring for someone who has tested positive for COVID-19.

In line with arrangements with other states, South Australian workers will not be eligible for the payment if they are receiving income, earnings or salary maintenance from work, receiving the JobKeeper Payment or other forms of Australian Government income support, or receive a Pandemic Leave payment from the South Australian Government.

The payment can be claimed again should an extended self-isolation or quarantine period longer than 14 days be instructed by health officials, or their period of caring is extended.

To date, more than $15.5 million in Pandemic Leave Disaster Payments have been paid for more than 10,300 granted claims since 6 August.

The fastest and easiest way to make a claim is over the phone by calling 180 22 66. Please do not visit a service centre.

 Government to pay workers' wages for coronavirus  

The federal government is planning to pay a generous share of wages for closed and hobbled businesses that retain their employees during the coronavirus recession.

The payments, being worked on by Treasury, will be similar to wage subsidies of 75 per cent to 80 per cent introduced by Canada, Denmark, New Zealand and the United Kingdom in response to the virus shutting down large parts of the economy.

Sources told *The Australian Financial Review* on Saturday that Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Treasurer Josh Frydenberg were finalising government-funded wage payments, which are set to be capped at middle income earner levels.

The emergency wage payments are expected to be announced in the next few days.

 More than 1 million people are [expected to become jobless]( due to governments shutting down business activity in response to the coronavirus and enforcing strict social distancing rules. 

 

More than 1 million people are [expected to become jobless]( due to governments shutting down business activity in response to the coronavirus and enforcing strict social distancing rules.

Economists are forecasting the unemployment rate to soar to between 10 per cent and 15 per cent due to mass job axings across retail, travel, hospitality, entertainment, sport and leisure.

Asked about the prospect of stronger wage support for businesses, Finance Minister Mathias Cormann said the government was working to "significantly expand" income support through business.

"We are going to provide the best possible support that we sensibly can to support business to support Australians who are deeply impacted by this crisis," Senator Cormann told the ABC Insiders program on Sunday.

"We are looking very hard on further expanding the level of income support through businesses to enable more businesses to stay in hibernation or to survive through this difficult period ahead \[and\] for a strong bounce back on the other side."

Senator Cormman said it would be done in an "Australian way" through the existing tax and transfer system so payments could be delivered quickly.

He said it would "not be responsible" to adopt an entirely new system like the UK wage subsidy model, because it would be too slow to set up and inject money into businesses.

The wage subsidies would typically be paid if a struggling employer keeps staff on the employment books and plans to give them work after the virus crisis passes.

Senator Cormann said that would be the "intention" of the extra support for employers.

[Labor and economists have called for the government to pay large wage subsidies]( to help businesses cling on to workers and underwrite some of the private sector's $300 billion annual wage and salary bill.

The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry [has been lobbying for an 80 per cent wage subsidy]( based on a similar system to the UK, capped at average full time earnings of about $1600 a week.

Mr Morrison has said many businesses [will need to go into "hibernation"]( for around six months. He has warned that banks, landlords, energy companies, governments and employees will need to make financial sacrifices so affected businesses can emerge unencumbered by large debts after the crisis passes.

[Retailer Myer announced on Friday night]( it will close its stores from Monday and stand down 10,000 store and support centre staff, taking retail job losses from the [COVID-19 crisis]( to more than 40,000.

Myer's decision mirrors similar moves by Solomon Lew's Premier Investments, Country Road Group, [foot wear retailer Accent Group, jewellery chains Michael Hill and Lovisa, fashion retailers Mosaic Brands]( City Chic and PAS Group, outdoor leisure retailer Kathmandu, homewares retailer Adairs and autoparts retailer Bapcor.

Canada on the weekend announced a 75 per cent wage subsidy for small and medium businesses, up from an initial 10 per cent, to encourage firms to keep workers on the payroll.

New Zealand is providing wage subsidies to employers of $NZ585.80 per week for full-time workers and $NZ350 for part-time workers.

Kiwi businesses are being asked to pay their employees 80 per cent of their pre-virus income.

If employers can't afford this, they are being asked to pass on the subsidy in full to their workers.

British Prime Minister [Boris Johnson, who reported he was infected with the virus on Friday night, has pledged to pay 80 per cent of people's wages]( to firms that keep paying workers.

The UK scheme is capped at £2500 ($4900) per worker each month.

Mr Morrison had previously ruled out adopting Mr Johnson's UK scheme, saying during the week that Treasury was not advising it and that it would require a whole new system to be built.

Instead the government so far has used the existing tax and transfer system.

As part of the government's economic rescue packages announced earlier this month, it doubled the weekly welfare payment for the jobless to $550.

Mr Morrison also pledged tax credits to small businesses, worth on average about 20 per cent of their wage costs.

The payments were not contingent on firms retaining workers.

The government is [providing between $20,000 and $100,000 to small businesses with annual turnover under $50 million and not-for-profit employers.](

The employers will receive a payment equal to 100 per cent of the PAYG withholding tax paid to the Australian Taxation Office on behalf of workers, up from the 50 per cent initially slated.

The soon-to-be-announced wage subsidies will be more generous and be better linked to retaining staff.
