"New cases" plots the aggregate number of cases across *all* sources (i.e., overseas, interstate and local).  In the coming days, I plan to break this down by source type.

**Queensland:** As it has been almost three weeks since the last infectious case was out in the community, we will be suspending the daily QLD update threads and taking QLD out of the press conference threads. As with WA, SA, TAS, NT, and ACT, users may post the daily updates as they come out if they wish. Both the Queensland flairs are available for users to use (to post official case updates). 

Congratulations to Queensland for stamping out this latest cluster!

 Some medicines will be restricted to one-per-purchase (ventolin and paracetamol were mentioned specifically)  Deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly addressed reports of shortages of some medicines like ventolin or paracetamol. He said the shortages have been localised at the moment and have happened because of panic buying:

&gt;"We have today worked through with pharmacists that they will be required to limit dispensing of certain prescription products to one month's supply at the prescribed dose. Sales of certain over-the-counter medicines — particularly Ventolin and Paracetemol, to a maximum of one unit per purchase.Pharmacists will be required to place children's paracetemol formulations, the syrup and the like, behind the counter to assist in allocating supply.

 A Collingwood staff member has tested positive for coronavirus  

The AFL club said that the staff member, who was recently overseas, had not been in contact with the clubs.

"Due to quarantine requirements, the staff member has at no point been in any contact with players or staff members at Collingwood since returning and has therefore presented no transmission risk to the club."

[AFL boss Gillon McLachlan said yesterday that if a player tested positive, the competition would be forced to shut down for 30 days]( 

Yesterday, Collingwood played its first AFL game for the season at Docklands stadium, recording a 13.8 (86) to 5.4 (43) victory over Western Bulldogs. Its women's team narrowly lost its AFLW finals match against North Melbourne 5.4 (34) to 5.2 (32).

 Three Formula One team members in Melbourne placed in isolation &gt;Three Formula One team members at the Australian Grand Prix have been placed into isolation after concerns they may have contracted the coronavirus.  
&gt;  
&gt;One member from McLaren and two from the Haas teams were evaluated at the circuit’s isolation unit, established by F1, after showing fever symptoms at the track.  
&gt;  
&gt;The team members have been tested for the virus and placed under self isolation at their hotels. There will be major concern if their tests are positive having already been mixing in the paddock while carrying the virus.  
&gt;  
&gt;On Monday, Andrew Westacott, CEO of the Australian Grand Prix Corporation, said the race will proceed as planned and there was “not a chance” the Grand Prix would be cancelled or postponed.

 WA is restricting its alcohol sales, because it can’t have its police and emergency services responding to alcohol-fueled instances while they are trying to keep the border in lockdown and ensure people are self-isolating.  

WA is restricting its alcohol sales, because it can’t have its police and emergency services responding to alcohol-fueled instances while they are trying to keep the border in lockdown and ensure people are self-isolating.

The new alcohol restrictions are:

Any person, per day, may purchase **one carton of beer or one carton of cider or premixed spirits,**

OR

**three bottles of wine,**

OR

**one litre of spirits or one litre of fortified wine.**

**Buyers may purchase a combination of any two of those packages.**

&gt;*This is a sensible precaution while we’re in a state of emergency. This is all about public safety and assurance. We know it’s a stressful time for our community and we don’t want people buying to excess; we have seen that happen with other foods and supplies and I have had reports of people filling shopping trolleys right up with alcohol, and this is a sensible precaution.*

WA is keen to stress this is not prohibition, as residents can still buy up to **100 standard drinks a day** under the new restrictions.

 BREAKING: NSW TO SHUT DOWN NON-ESSENTIAL SERVICES  

The NSW Government will proceed to a more comprehensive shutdown of non-essential service over the next 48 hours.

Supermarkets, petrol stations, pharmacies, convenience stores, freight and logistics, and home delivery will be among the many services that will remain open.

Schools will also remain open tomorrow.

 NSW reports 1 new local case and 2 new overseas cases # New cases reported in the last 24 hours

* **2** are returned overseas travellers in hotel quarantine
* **1** is locally acquired and was acquired at Concord Hospital:
   * *The locally acquired case worked at Concord Hospital while potentially infectious. The case cared for patients with COVID-19 and further investigation is underway to identify how the infection was acquired.*

**Note:**

&gt;NSW Health advises that further assessments and testing of the case reported in **Murrumbidgee LHD** on Thursday has determined it was a **false positive and therefore not a case**.  
&gt;  
&gt;Testing has decreased this week (down 16%) though overall testing rates remain high. The largest decrease in testing rates this week was evident in school-aged children.  The number of people reporting flu-like symptoms has decreased; this may lead to a reduction in testing rates for COVID-19.  
&gt;  
&gt;Proportion of locally-acquired cases interviewed by public health staff within 1 day of notification to NSW Health = 100%  
&gt;  
&gt;Proportion of close contacts (identified by the case) contacted by public health within 48 hours of case notification = 100%

# Sources of confirmed cases - last updated 7:00 PM [10/09]

NSW Health has updated the missing data that I reported on Wednesday night. The discrepancy between the 1 additional overseas case, and missing local known case from the 6th has been resolved; I think our data friends at NSW Health were a little sleepy when updating the data yesterday - lol. One unknown case from 6th has now also been reclassified as known - *hoorah!*

^(\*The case reported on the 06/07 worked at both Concord Hospital ED) *^(and)* ^(Liverpool Hospital ED while potentially infectious. Therefore, it is probable that this case is the source of the first Concord Hospital ED case \[07/09\]. In total, NSW Health reports that there are 12 people associated with this cluster, 8 of whom are HCWs, 1 hospital visitor, 1 patient and 2 household contacts of the patient \[09/09\]. While this cluster was first confined to the EDs of each hospital, Dr Chant advises that it is likely to have been transmitted to other areas of the hospital \[09/09\].)
