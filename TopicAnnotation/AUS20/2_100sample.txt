 Gyms reopen in Melbourne Dont you guys think reopening gyms in late November is extreme. If you look at Fitness Victoria article below, it seems as though gyms are not as infection as Bret Sutton said in the press conference at all. Plus now that we are wearing masks and hand sanitising+spray and wiping equipment I don’t understand how they plan to reopen so late. Gyms are essential services!

 ‘Go Big’ on Coronavirus Stimulus, Trump Says, Pitching Checks for Americans Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin made the case to Republican senators  on Tuesday for $1 trillion plan, including $250 billion for direct  checks to Americans by the end of April. 

Maybe Trump is the right man for the situation. Can't say I've ever liked him, but his tendency to 'go big' with everything does lend itself to such a dire situation.

 Japan mulls easing entry limits for four countries: Thailand, Vietnam, Australia, New Zealand *By Takashi Nakamichi - 31 May 2020, 10:54 GMT+10*

Japan is considering easing entry restrictions on people from Thailand, Vietnam, Australia and New Zealand because of signs that novel coronavirus infections are declining in those countries, the Yomiuri newspaper reported, citing government officials.

The government may relax the limits from as early as summer, the newspaper said Sunday. The visitors would be required to carry documentation showing that they had tested negative for the virus before leaving their countries, and would need to be re-tested when they arrive in Japan, according to the report.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s administration remains cautious toward softening the restrictions any time soon on China as any early reopening could trigger a backlash from the U.S., which has been critical of the mainland’s handling of the disease, the report said. Japan is also being careful about opening up for visitors from South Korea because of increasing infections there, it said.

 QLD records 2 new cases * New cases are 19-year-old women, one from Logan, one from Acacia Ridge.
* Being cared for at the PA Hospital.
* They both travelled together recently, including returning to Brisbane from Melbourne on July 21 via Sydney.
* One of them works at Parklands Christian College. The school is closed as a deep clean is going underway.
* The young women went about their business within the communities that they live in and so there will be a large amount of contact tracing to be done, largely within it the Logan and Springfield areas, including shopping malls, restaurants and a church.
*  Jeanette Young: "The initial investigation is indicating that there were incorrect details on their declaration passes and we are still trying to examine all of those facts and obtain the border declaration passes. Investigation will look at whether that was deliberate or otherwise. Our concern of course is that these people were able to get through the border....I will not get into what they have done as the investigation will determine that."
* Police have launched a criminal investigation as to how the two women managed to travel to Victoria and return to Queensland without going into quarantine.

 South Korean COVID-19 Test Kits "Not Accurate, Falls Well Below US FDA Standards" Claims Stanford School of Medicine Scientist Casting Doubt on Korean Government's Official Numbers (Xpost from r/VanCovid19) As you know the global media is praising the Koreans for testing everyone and that more people have been recovered than diagnosed. My Korean friends have just directed me to an interesting recent development in the past 20 hours.

A famous Korean medical professor has posted on his Facebook that he has a letter from Dr. Seung-min Park, a Scientist at Standford School of Medicine, which allegedly describe a comparison experiment between the Korean test kits with others that concluded the Korean test kits were "inadequate", "fell well below US FDA standards" even adding that even in the most dire situations "it cannot be relied upon".

The Korean professor says this puts into question the numbers being reported by the Korean government and that potentially thousands of people who were tested negative are roaming freely.

There are increasing number of cases being reported by the mainstream Korean media where those who tested negative are resulting in positive, in one particular case, a person was tested 6 times with the kit until the 7th try yielded a positive result,  raising questions about the accuracy of government's reporting and the test kit. 

This shocking claim is sending shockwaves throughout the country is being shared all over Korean social media. What we have come to believe about South Korea's official figures are now being questioned.

 Netflix is in talks with the Australian government about reducing the quality of its streams in order to help the NBN cope with increasing demand while people are at home  

Netflix [is in talks to reduce the quality of its streams in Australia]( as the NBN continues to be squeezed by skyrocketing usage due to the coronavirus epidemic.

The Australian can confirm that the US streaming giant has had discussions with the government and internet service providers including Telstra about limiting the quality – and therefore internet traffic – of Netflix shows and movies.

 

If implemented, the move will mean streaming quality will be limited to standard definition, rather than high definition or 4K, for all users.

Watching high definition films and shows on Netflix uses about 3GB of data per hour - three times more than standard definition – and it’s estimated that streaming services including Netflix account for between 70 and 80 per cent of Australian internet traffic during peak times.

NBN usage was up by about 5 per cent last week, a figure that’s set to soar as Australians across the country work and study from home.

The plans follow a similar move in Europe, announced overnight, which Netflix said should reduce its traffic there by around 25 per cent.

 Leaked emails reveal government knew of problems on day one of hotel quarantine 

“Top bureaucrats warned senior health officials at the beginning of the Andrews government's botched hotel quarantine scheme that security guards were ill-equipped for the work and demanded police be called in to take control.

The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald have seen leaked emails between senior officials in leading agencies involved in the quarantine system, which was supposed to protect the community from imported COVID-19 cases.


The first email raising concerns was sent by a senior bureaucrat at the Department of Jobs, Precincts and Regions within 24 hours of the March 28 launch of the program.

It was addressed to several senior officials at the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), which was the leading agency for the day-to-day management of hotel quarantine, according to an Emergency Management Victoria operational document seen by The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald.
"We request that Victoria Police is present 24/7 at each hotel starting from this evening. We ask that DHHS urgently make that request as the control agency," the email read.

DHHS was asked to address issues on the supply and distribution of masks and gloves, and to clarify policies on whether detainees could leave their rooms or order UberEats takeaway food.


The email was also sent to Emergency Management Victoria, which was jointly responsible for the hotel scheme alongside DHHS.

The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald have chosen not to reveal the identities of those named in the email exchanges, or to quote from the emails in full, because those involved had not consented to providing the emails to the media.

Premier Daniel Andrews announced an inquiry into Victoria's quarantine scheme, to be led by former judge Jennifer Coate, after protocol breaches by guards at the Rydges on Swanston and Stamford Plaza hotels were identified as the source of coronavirus outbreaks in Melbourne's north and west.

The outbreaks marked the start of a second surge across the state. Victoria recorded 177 new cases of COVID-19 on Monday after more than a week of triple-digit daily increases. In May and June, there were dozens of days when fewer than 10 new cases were reported statewide.

The state’s Chief Health Officer said on Monday it was "conceivable" that all the active COVID-19 cases in Victoria stemmed from Melbourne’s problem quarantine hotel program.”

 [Aus] Number of ICU beds, oxygen, ECMO, etc. required - ***Absolutely terrifying - read at own risk*** This first paragraph I have copied and pasted from the journal article below.  I chose that article because it a single, simple paragraph. 
The original JAMA article is at the end of this document.
* … A total of 81% of cases in the JAMA study were classified as mild, meaning they did not result in pneumonia or resulted in only mild pneumonia. Fourteen percent of cases were severe (marked by difficulty breathing), and 5% were critical (respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction or failure.*



81% = Mild – No or only mild pneumonia.  

14% = Severe - Marked by difficulty breathing.  

15% = Critical – Respiratory failure, septic shock, or organ dysfunction or failure

(=&gt; 2.3% = Case Fatality Rate (CFR))

My numbers for Australia:- 
The comparative figures for Covid-19 I have been working from are below.  
I’ve done lots of rounding to keep the figures simple.

Assumptions:-
1.	Australia is going to have an infection rate similar to the rest of the world.  
40-70%.  
2.	Aus. can transfer intensive care equipment (ECMO, etc.) and medical staff from state to state as easily as China.
3.	The virus does not mutate too much…
4.	This is not a bi-phasal virus with 2nd infection worse than 1st.

Cases
Rounding the 40-70% to 50% x Aus. pop (rounded to 25m)  
= 0.5 x 25 million 
= 0.5 x 25,000,000 
= 12,5000,000 infected cases

Hospitalised
Rounding the 19% to 20% x # of cases  
Twenty percent of cases infected need hospitalisation 
= 0.2 x 12,5000,000 
= 2,500,000 need hospitalisation

Respiratory failure
Rounding 5/14 to 30% x # hospitalised
Thirty percent of those hospitalised need assistance breathing (Oxygen, etc.)
= 0.3 x 2,500,000 
= 750,000 need Respiratory assistance

Death
Rounding 49% to 50% x # in respiratory failure
Fifty percent of those in Respiratory failure die
= 375,000 die

 Victoria's hotel quarantine inquiry reveals a quagmire of blame and lack of responsibility 
++++++++++
 The science behind spikes in U.S. coronavirus infections [ 

&gt; COVID-19 spreads virtually unchecked across the United States. The Johns Hopkins University tally showed almost 100,000 new cases over the weekend in the U.S., and the total confirmed cases surged to over three million. Florida has reported daily highs of 10,000 new cases. Arizona has seen record hospitalizations. **Countless Americans joined festivities across the country. Health experts fear in five to seven days, there would be a new spike in cases.** Donald Trump and Joe Biden have both made the pandemic a top campaign issue. And Trump's campaign team says it will hold another rally this week. That's despite criticism from health experts of previous re-election events, **as some Trump staffers later tested positive for the virus**. While many states are gradually re-opening their economy, it was a daunting challenge for some that opened too quickly. What's the public health prognosis in the U.S.? Earlier, Tian Wei talked to Eric Rubin, the editor in chief of the New England Journal of Medicine, who said a lack of leadership left states to fend for themselves.

 The importance of early and drastic measures A modelling tool for COVID-19 spread has been developed by University of Basel in Switzerland. You can access it here:  

The credentials of the team who developed the tool look very solid. Read about them on the "About" page of the link.

Putting in the relevant Australian numbers (population (25 million) current infections (700), number of hospital beds (92000) ICUs (2013) etc), we get the following results:

If "no mitigation" measures are taken, we end up with 238,000 deaths

If "weak mitigation" measures are taken, we end up with 210,000 deaths

If "moderate mitigation" measures are taken - 137,000 dead. The key difference here is that the hospital system is not completely overwhelmed, and most people get treatment. But there is a significant fatality rate even with treatment. This is what "flattening the curve" looks like.

If "strong measures" are taken, the loss of life falls to.... 2285 people. The disease does not reach a large percentage of population. This is what China managed to do. 

Note however that for every 4 day delay in implementing "strong measures" the death toll will double.

The model does not explicitly state what "weak", "moderate" and "strong" mitigation measures actually are. But the current spread data in Australia is consistent with "weak" measures.

The current government response seems to be focused on trying to manage the economic effects of COVID-19 epidemic. Unless we are willing to accept 200,000+ deaths, this will have to change. Every 4 day delay will result in doubling of deaths. 

We need drastic measures, and we need them early. 

The best way to limit the economic impact of this epidemic is to first and foremost address the spread of infections directly.

 Boris Johnson Tests Positive for COVID-19 Boris Johnson tests positive for CORVID-19

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has tested positive for coronavirus.

Mr Johnson said he developed mild symptoms over the past 24 hours, including a temperature and cough.

He said he will now self-isolate in No 10 but will "continue to lead the government's response via video-conference as we fight this virus".

Mr Johnson was last seen on Thursday night, as he clapped outside No 10 as part of a nationwide gesture to thank NHS staff.

In a video on his Twitter account, Mr Johnson said: "I'm working from home and self-isolating and that's entirely the right thing to do.

"But, be in no doubt that I can continue thanks to the wizardry of modern technology to communicate with all my top team to lead the national fightback against coronavirus.

"I want to thank everybody involved and, of course, our amazing NHS staff."

He was tested at No 10 by NHS staff, on the personal advice of England's chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, Downing Street said.

He will still be in charge of the government's handling of the crisis, the statement added.

There are more than 11,600 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK, and 578 people have died.

Earlier this week, the prime minister's spokesman confirmed that Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, as the first secretary of state, was the selected minister to stand in if Mr Johnson became unwell.

It comes after the Prince of Wales also tested positive for the virus earlier this week.

Prince Charles, 71, is to be displaying mild symptoms "but otherwise remains in good health", a spokesman said.

 Victorians to be banned from Queensland from July 10 Queensland will completely close its borders to Victorians from midday July 10, Premier Annastasia Palaszczuk has announced.

Victorians were previously still allowed to enter the state if they self-quarantined for 14 days at their own expense, but the Premier announced that would change so that no visitor from Victoria will be allowed to gain access or be able to quarantine in Queensland.

The border will still officially open to other states including NSW as of July 10.

Exemptions for essential specialist workers will be permitted but "very few exemptions will be granted", the Premier [tweeted]( ahead of a 9.15am press conference.

"It is strongly recommended that Queenslanders do not travel to Victoria. Queensland residents returning from Victoria will gain access, but they must quarantine in a hotel for 14 days at their expense," she tweeted.

Health Minister Steven Miles said there were no new cases of coronavirus in Queensland over the past 24 hours, keeping the state's total at two cases.

 The Story Between Humans, Animals, Nature, Life In The New Corona Virus NCOV Event **The Story Between Humans, Animals, Nature, Life In The New Corona Virus NCOV Event**

If you are looking for another view and want to understand more about what exactly going at the moment on planet Earth during the NCOV event, then this is a story you should read.

From the ancient times, humans are the hunters and going to hunt all kind of animals in the wild forest. But most of that animals are the invisible one, so there is no big deal for them.

And by nature, there are a lot of new clans, new groups and including the authority was setup for “more productive”.

Suddenly one day, the invisible beast like a lion appear but this is a legendary lion have wings and can fly.

The authorities who are only stay at home in the city do not know exactly what is going on.

Some hunters tell them they are the dangerous just like a lion, some say they are just the cat, and a hidden legendary hunter say they are the unstoppable beast from ancient textbox.

The authority know the dangerous of that new animals, but instead of telling the truth to the people, they are keep telling the hunter that “they are just a big cat, not a big deal”.

After hearing that message from the authorities, many hunters still keep doing what they are doing everyday without any fear or any prepare. The time pass and many many hunters passed away mysterious.

And now the authorities instead of asking all the hunters to seek real information, they only ask the “scout” group called the scientist who their jobs is just using microscope, camera to capture the actions. Many governments are refuse to talk any theory about that legendary beast unless you have photo or videos like the scientist.

Ask yourself simple question: if you think hunters or any scientist can easily using camera to record that beast in details, then you are an absolutely idiots !!!

And those idiots are the government &amp; authorities are controlling you guys in this NCOV battle.

They are having no clue what is going on, they only want to enslave the people and keep the regime.

Instead of seeking new information from all people, they only rely on the “media, scout, scientist”.

For you know that the science is only for kids and stupid people. They are no much different than the media, they only describe and telling what was happened.  
 

What people need now is the solution, the way to solve the NCOV problem, they do not need some stupid statistics or image/video. The governments better wake up before too late.

**It is very easy to solve the problems if you seek help from all entities either online or offline. Just give a chance for whoever claim able to handle to problems, instead of gambling on only the “science”.**

What is the winning condition in this battle with the new corona virus NCOV, can any so called world leaders or any secret societies, elders can answer?

No, because they have no clue, just look at their actions.

People need a real leader who can lead them through this chaos, they do not need a “gambler, politician, businessman” who do not sure whether or not can solve this problem.  
 You will have more chance to survive if you follow and listen to any entity who claim have cure &amp; solution for the problems than the “not sure” one.

I am the legendary hunter who know that legendary beast and the forest map very well. But because almost nobody listen to me, then I still keep the best and waiting the right opportunity to reveal it.

Best Regard,  
 **The Savior**

 The Expert But Idiot I made a post on /r/wuhan_flu titled  **Pre-Pandemic Peak Post Mortem: the Intellectual Yet Idiot,** about how our so called experts are idiots. I originally adopted Intellectual Yet Idiot concept by Nassim Taleb to describe the current medical leadership. A poster pointed out that Intellectuals is not the appropriate descriptor as it meant something else in Taleb's article. Fair point. So I will just be a revisionist and ask you to replace "Intellectual" with "Expert" as embodied in people like Kerry Chant and Brad Hazzard.

 [ 

 

# Pre-Pandemic Peak Post Mortem: the Intellectual Yet Idiot

[**Meta**](

The Intellectual Yet Idiot is a phrase coined by Nassim Taleb (author of 'The Black Swan', a very timely book if there ever was one) to describe people who are "self-described members of the “intelligentsia” (who) can’t find a coconut in Coconut Island, meaning they aren’t intelligent enough to define intelligence hence fall into circularities".

"Indeed one can see that these academico-bureaucrats who feel entitled to run our lives aren’t even rigorous, whether in medical statistics or policymaking. They can’t tell science from scientism — in fact in their image-oriented minds scientism looks more scientific than real science."

You can read the whole article here: [

Now that we are at the door step of this pandemic, let's count the ways the Intellectuals Were being Idiots indeed:

1. Basing Western pandemic strategies on Chinese data. Chinese data was found to be a formula
2. Knowing 5 million escaped Wuhan. So they only banned flights from Wuhan, knowing 5 million escaped Wuhan
3. Relying on WHO for pandemic policy. Knowing that WHO didn't send people to ground zero to investigate
4. Limited knowledge of the virus' full capability. Basing quarantine policy on limited knowledge of virus' capability
5. Seeing China shutdown 700 million of their populations' cities. Not asking why China quarantined 700 million people
6. Knows the virus is cold-virus like with all the attendant vectors and fomites and can travel the world very quickly. Still let all Chinese in. Or banned Chinese from entering, knowing any other national in a transit airport or a third country can still get infected by a Chinese.
7. Told people NOT to wear masks when infection rates were low or nil. Told people to wear masks when infections rates were already high

Any other example of Intellectual Yet Idiotism?

 The psychological impact of quarantine and how to reduce it. Studies show quarantines can lead to PTSD, confusion &amp; anger. Researchers recommend reducing stressors by minimizing length of quarantine, keeping people informed and providing supplies to reduce stress and financial burden.  The December, 2019 coronavirus disease outbreak has seen many countries ask people who have potentially come into contact with the infection to isolate themselves at home or in a dedicated quarantine facility. Decisions on how to apply quarantine should be based on the best available evidence. We did a Review of the psychological impact of quarantine using three electronic databases. Of 3166 papers found, 24 are included in this Review. Most reviewed studies reported negative psychological effects including post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion, and anger. Stressors included longer quarantine duration, infection fears, frustration, boredom, inadequate supplies, inadequate information, financial loss, and stigma. Some researchers have suggested long-lasting effects. In situations where quarantine is deemed necessary, officials should quarantine individuals for no longer than required, provide clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols, and ensure sufficient supplies are provided. Appeals to altruism by reminding the public about the benefits of quarantine to wider society can be favourable.

 COVID-19 What Australia Doesn’t Want Us To Know From a friend in Australia: Just got a one hour briefing from a cabinet minister after their full day on Covid-19 with the chief medical officers of aus, uk, USA and Israel and prime minister yesterday. Summary as follows:
- 60% of Aussies will be infected 
- South Korea is testing 15,000 per day. Mortality rate there is 0.6%. This makes it a bad flu (10X normal flu rate). That’s the expected mortality rate in Australia 
- mortality rate grows exponentially from age of 70 as per normal flu. Mortality rates there are 10-15%
- so deaths in Australia to be tens of thousands, mainly aged
- mortality is not out and out their main concern, it’s a third of the workforce being sick and economic impact 
- there is no stopping the virus, masks limited use, advice is to get it early while there are hospital beds. Masks only useful to stop infected people infecting others. There is one mask factory in Australia which the Australian defence force has now taken over to produce 5m masks per month 
- most of our sunny paper is made in Adelaide, so don't worry about that!
- vaccine up to a year away 
- Govt response is not to stop the virus but to flatten the peak of the bell curve, so we have only 1-2m infected per month. Worst month expected to be June, easing by September and all done be December 
- we will be in recession next quarter. This is a 1 in 100 year economic event but we are going to manage it much better than in past
- tomorrow the government will announce a whopping 1% of GDP fiscal injection to prop up the economy. This will be focussed on small business investment. This Is biggest Govt spend over our history (to be spent over 90 day period). The banks will come to the party passing on rate cuts
- hospitals are cancelling elective surgeries to make bed space for the aged infected
- difference between this and SARS for instance is that China failed to act for 6 weeks. It could have been contained 
- however China sees the end in sight. Iron etc prices have not dropped. This is because Chinese mills are stockpiling, getting ready for massive production and rebuilding rush later in year. Australia will boom again from this
- our business should be prepared for how to get contractor resources on the expectation of up to a third of our staff being ill at a time, how to work remotely etc. 
- Trivia: the reason the Iranian political elite are all ill is because the Chinese have been engaging them heavily.

 NSW: Another pub, the Macarthur Tavern in Campbelltown, announces COVID-19 case Another pub in south-west Sydney says it has been informed by NSW Health that a patron who attended their venue has tested positive for coronavirus.

The Macarthur Tavern in Campbelltown shared the news on Facebook this morning.

The patron attended the venue on Saturday between 9pm and midnight, it said in the post.

“There is no requirement for the premises to shut down or for any member of staff or patron to self-isolate but they will need to remain vigilant for any respiratory symptoms and get tested immediately and self-isolate should symptoms develop,” it added.

It is not known if the case was reported in yesterday's numbers, or linked to the Crossroads Hotel outbreak.

The pub will reopen at 3pm today after a deep clean.

NSW Health has been contacted for comment.

 Coronavirus: Seek hurting as job ads plunge amid COVID-19 shutdowns  

Online recruitment platform SEEK says short-term revenue will be greatly affected by the coronavirus economic shutdown because of a plunge in job advertisements.

The company has withdrawn full-year guidance, saying billings from job ads dropped by more than half in March due to the global pandemic.

In a statement released to the ASX on Monday, SEEK said its Australian and New Zealand website and its SEEK Asia operations recorded a fall in billings of approximately 60 per cent for the week ending March 29 compared to the corresponding period in 2019.

 SEEK’s core business has been hit hard by the COVID-19 economic fallout, as companies press pause on recruitment in an attempt to lower costs while in commercial hibernation. 

 

or the week ending March 22, Seek recorded a decline in billings of 40 per cent across its ANZ and Asian businesses.

Seek said that while the decline in billings was starting to stabilise, it was deferring the payment of its half yearly dividend.

 

SEEK chief executive Andrew Bassat said the economic challenge would affect short-term profitability and that a dividend payout in the current environment was not viable.

“Deferring the dividend was a decision that we did not make lightly,” Mr Bassat said.

“The level of uncertainty arising from the virus has prompted us to take a prudent approach to managing our cash flow and balance sheet.”

In its interim results released on February 25, Seek noted its Chinese and Hong Kong businesses were directly impacted by COVID-19 regional shutdowns, but said at the time that overall company guidance remained on track.

The company’s Chinese recruiting site, Zhaopin, had recorded an approximately 60 per cent decline in billings in February. But Seek noted the decline had eased in March as operating conditions gradually returned to normal.

“When the pandemic subsides, as it will, job creation will be at the core of economic recovery,” Mr Bassat said.

“Our focus remains on executing against our existing long-term growth strategies and developing new employment and education solutions to meet the needs of our customers in the months and years ahead.”

The company has implemented hirer support measures to assist businesses in the associated costs of recruiting new employees.

SEEK said it would relieve employers of monthly ad spending obligations and would only charge them for ads used. It has also extended the expiry date for all pre-purchased ad packs.

For the first six months of the 2020 financial year, the group posted an interim net profit of $75.6m, which was down 24 per cent compared to the previous half yearly result.

As at December 31, 2019, the company had a net debt position of $895m. It also noted it recently refinanced its syndicated loan facility, allowing it to raise an additional $150m. As at April 6, SEEK said it had $395m in undrawn debt facilities.
