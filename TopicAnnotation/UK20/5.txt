 Just like speed limits, social distancing policy should be *guided by* the science, but not to the exclusion of everything else There's been a lot of complaint lately about how policies on lockdown easing, social distancing, etc are not being based completely on the science. Rather, politics are coming into play - and that's seen as being wrong, but really it's inevitable.

Take road speed limits. If you asked a road safety specialist what a "safe" speed limit is, they would probably tell you 20 mph. That's a speed where nearly all accidents are survivable. Typically [nearly 2 000 people die and 25 000 are seriously injured]( in road accidents every year in the UK. If we set speed limit policy entirely according to the science, then the vast majority of those deaths and serious injuries would be avoided.

But for politicians, other factors come into play. A lower speed limit would make transporting goods around the country slower and more expensive, which would hurt the economy. People would waste a great deal of time travelling - even for essential things like commuting and shopping (don't forget that buses would be slowed down just the same as private cars). Many leisure activities would become impossibly time-consuming.

So for all those reasons, politicians (of all parties) over the years have instead set the speed limits considerably above what pure science says is "safe". And the public by and large go along with this; very few people are campaigning for lower speed limits. Most people recognise that high speed travel has risks, but that the benefits exceed the downsides. We accept that every decade nearly 20 000 people die, and quarter of a million are seriously injured, entirely avoidably.

It's the same with Coronavirus policy. If **all** you care about is minimising Coronavirus deaths, then the science says that you need to says strictly locked down for many months, and never get within 2m of another person. But politicians have to think about the other factors - the effect on mental health and wellbeing, the economic damage that will inevitably also cost a great deal of lives in the future, etc.

Coronavirus is a new, scary and very serious problem to manage. But that doesn't mean we should handle it entirely differently to a whole load of other issues, where we have to balance risks and benefits for the best overall good - which is not always, or even mostly, **just** about minimising deaths from that specific thing.

 We're all passengers in a racecar Flattening the curve, building immunity in the resilient, protecting the vulnerable, the futility of suppression due to other places with weaker healthcare, all of those I can accept. The basic goals of the plan seem sound to me, and I think I can reasonably expect those in charge to not make errors in the details.

It's still uncomfortable to see the plan in action. In a motor racing analogy of the epidemic case curve, the horizontal line of healthcare capacity is a hard wall at the next corner. Braking is needed to reduce speed and corner safely. But as civilians we're all passengers in the car, and:

1. We can see China and Italy wrecked on the side of the track.
2. We haven't been told where the corner is, what the cornering speed will be, and when braking will start (the target capacity and when to implement controls).
3. We know the brakes need to be slammed on weeks before the corner is reached to reach the right speed (incubation period).
4. The accelerator is stuck on, we're already moving uncomfortably fast, and when the driver said he'll try to take the corner he actually reduced braking (reduction of isolation period).
5. While the driver is super good at computer simulations, nobody has ever approached this corner in real life and not crashed; some have stopped short and that option looks really attractive right about now.

 Will travel insurance protect against cancelled flights? With us still being in the early stages of Covid-19, situations across the globe are constantly changing and so are the ways countries are reacting to it. 

With the holiday season coming up, how is this going to evolve and affect international travel in the broader scope? 

I’m traveling to New York for 10 days in early May, and I’m worried about my flights ending up cancelled. If that were to happen, how would travel insurers react? Would they still cover you and reimburse any travel costs if the cancellation of a flight is out of your control? 

My flights etc are booked but I haven’t picked my insurance yet.

 Moratorium on flights from mainland China. Following the Australian example

To give some more time.

How can this happen?

We need to isolate the disease not transfer it from one continent to another. Somewhere has to be the world reserve for production.

 Where would you change leftover Currency in the U.K? Where would you change leftover currency; We have a variety of currencies from last summer - Some Swedish and Danish Kroner, some Euro's etc..

I would like to change them to put towards a 'Staycation' Camber Sands here we come.

They would have been re-used but we could not visit Europe because of the Coronavirus lockdown so we didn't take the flights.

I'm super curious where you would change leftover currency in the current climate.

Thankyou

 Just had another text from GP reminding about not going to surgery,hospital or a pharmacy. Never even thought that people would be going to ask pharmacists! Advice call 111 if you've returned from infected country within 14 days or been in close contact with infected person recently!

 Stop spreading hysteria Death is bad. 

However, you would think by this sub that the death rate of this virus is 50% ffs. People sharing stories and telling people where to go and where not to to as if they have ultimate control over people's lives.

This entire fiasco has really shown how heard mentality can be detrimental to an entire nation. People with underlying heart conditions and weakened immune systems die most from this, yet most of you are acting as if everyone dies from this. Get yourself together ffs.

Yes people are going to die. None of us want anyone to die but shaming people and asking for tOuGhEr ReStIcTioNs isn't going to stop people from dying.

This is a communicable disease. A lot of the population have had it. Many didn't even know they had had it and the vast majority have survived without needing to speak to any medical professional. Yet you all act like it's the opposite.

Honestly, some of you should get a job in the media with your click bait reactions to everything jfc.

 my community is encouraging. i see a post about panic buys and how the people of the UK are selfish arseholes - and well its hard to argue that he is wrong, but he is wrong about EVERYONE.

i went home yesterday to a postcard through my door from a neighbor offering their services if we need to self isolate, i see posts from teachers offering child care and multiple posts from people offering help.

above that we have all the NHS staff who i trust with my life, not because i HAVE too but because i know that they are genuine heros and will do everything in their power for me and my loved ones. then we have police, firefighters and in these days even your asda checkout staff and shelf stackers all continuing on at personal risk.

ill be printing post cards off tonight to offer to my neighbours to see if i can help them and ill be there if i possibly can be. ill be looking out for other ideas as to how i can help in this shitty situation.

while i cant argue the panic buying is pure stupid and inconsiderate, it is a few (admittedly clean) arseholes ruining for the rest of us. im not gonna lose faith in everyone just yet.

 My flatmates aren’t cooperating and I don’t know what to do I live in a shared flat with 4 other people. One of my flatmates is taking the situation seriously like myself however the other 3 aren’t. They’re meeting up with friends, inviting people over and not taking any precautions. Now one of them isn’t feeling well. She has a cough, a slight temperature and her chest feels tight. They still aren’t taking things seriously and my flatmate who isn’t well was even going to go to work (she works in customer service)! Is there anything I could do? Anyone I could contact? How can I make my flatmates understand?

 Best masks to buy and from where? I'm reading at lot about N95 respirator masks being the more effective ones to buy but want to ask others on here many thanks.
