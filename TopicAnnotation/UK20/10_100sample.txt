 Updates to COVID Tracker UK: New map feature, overall improvements Hi everyone, I  posted here a while back with the website I created for tracking coronavirus cases. Thank you all for those who used it and gave me feedback, it was quite helpful. Since then, I have implemented quite new features and some improvements, and I thought I should share again with you all:

**Website Link:**  [**

**1.  New interactive coronavirus map**

This is the main new feature since my last post. Basically, this map shows the weekly new case rates for the various local authorities in England, and displays the weekly and per-million stats.  I have also made a change in case rates function that shows blue for areas with decreasing weekly cases, and red for areas with increasing weekly cases, which you can use if you wish, but I personally found it to be rather difficult to look at. Clicking on a region also takes you to the respective chart for the region. Right now this feature is only for England, might add other areas in the future too as soon as I find out how to get the data for them...



**2. Charts for NI, Wales and Scotland**

This was highly requested, and fortunately the new beta GOV.UK coronavirus dashboard provides the API for it, so I could add them rather easily.

**3. Permalinks for charts**

You can now bookmark the charts for the areas that you want, so you no longer have to keep looking them up from the list.

**4. Graph now shows both pillar 1 and 2 data**

Not a change by me, but the GOV.UK dashboard now includes pillar 2 data too, so they are added into the charts too. I initially wanted to be able to separate these two pillars, but I'm not sure where I can get the individual data by each pillar. A new "About this data" popup is also added for those who are interested in how things are calculated/where I get my data from.

As usual, please feel free to give me more feedback! I quite enjoyed doing this website (I must have too much free time rip), so I'm still thinking of what I can add to it. My current plan for now is to add an interactive scale for the map on the upper corner, and to migrate to the new GOV.UK dashboard to fetch the coronavirus data, and maybe even add death/hospital/testing usage data too? Not too sure if that's what people want. Thanks!

 Weekly Total Deaths in Scotland up to wk commencing 27 April 2020 compared to Previous 5 year Average 
++++++++++
 There were 616,014 deaths registered in the UK in 2018 or 1,688 per day If we end up with a terrible number of 20,000 coronavirus deaths from mostly older people with underlying health problems, is it wrong to put that into perspective with the average daily deaths of 1,688 based on 2018 numbers?

We will get through this.

Please can people stop panic buying.

Please can people stop abusing supermarket staff.

Keep calm and be polite.

 Mild Cases being diverted to home treatment, plus breakdown of current stats:  *In a major change of policy, some people who are confirmed to have contracted the virus are now being treated at home rather than in hospital.*  


*Of the 115 confirmed cases across the UK since the outbreak began in late January, 18 have been cured, 52 are still being cared for in hospital and 45 are being treated at hone, said Dr Susan Hopkins, deputy director of Public Health England’s National Infection Service*

 NHS Test and Trace Statistics - 13th August to 19th August 

Hi all, the new NHS Test and Trace report have been released.

At the week ending 19th August, 442,392 people were tested for COVID-19, with 602 positive cases coming from pillar 1.

Pillar 1 positivity rate - 0.46% (down from 0.59% the previous week

Pillar 2 positivity rate - 1.76% (down from 1.94% the previous week)

Overall positivity rate - 1.38% (down from 1.53% the previous week)

Good to see the positivity rate declined again this week. Overall things seem to have plateaued but good to see we haven’t seen a sharp increase like other European countries.

Have a great week everybody!

 PHE local Covid cases map updated 

As an aside, there seems to be more cases in more deprived areas (from just a cursory look over the areas I know the demographics of, so by no means an in depth analysis) which fits in with previous data that showed those from lower socioeconomic status were over-represented in both those hospitalised and mortality figures. Guess there are so many factors - crowding, nutrition, health, behaviour

 We need to emulate the best performing countries - weekly growth rate analysis. I thought I'd do some analysis based on the rate of growth in COVID19 cases to take a slightly alternative view on where this might be going. People tend to fixate on the raw number of cases/deaths by country, but given how important the exponential nature of growth in infections has been proven to be (see [this]( great post), where we stand now will be affected as much if not more by that growth rate than the current number of cases.

Given this, see below an analysis of % Growth in cases over the last 7 days, countries with over 100 Confirmed cases. Arguments about quality and completeness of testing in different countries aside, I think we need to look to emulate the actions of the Japanese/Koreans/Singaporeans/HK and China to get a handle on this rampant growth.

&amp;#x200B;



We appear to be "middle of the pack" in terms of growth, but a 658% weekly growth in cases is certainly not sustainable. It does highlight potentially huge issues for other European nations too though, and they will also need to clamp down, as their status will be intertwined with ours over the coming months given the amount of movement between nations.

REMEMBER:

Stay at home for 7 days if you have either:

a high temperature

a new continuous cough

if you live with other people, they should stay at home for 14 days from the day the first person got symptoms.
This will help to protect others in your community while you are infectious.
Do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital.

 Latest: Didier Raoult Chloroquine protocol: 1 death, 1003 patients treated It's  been sent 1 hour ago on Twitter by Didier Raoult. He released his  latest covid-19 treatment evidences on real people. His team treated 1003 patients in IHU  Marseille with hydroxychloroquine-azithromycine . Only 1 death. We  wanted bigger sample evidence, we know have the confirmation that giving  that as soon as people get covid-19 positive helps sensibly.

[

[

At the IHU, for the past week, 16,506 screenings have been carried out. Of the 1,003 patients treated, only one death was reported. He is an 86 year old man. Another 70-year-old patient is in intensive care.

[

Roche  Director just announced to be convinced by their internal tests on Chloroquine and they will give 130 millions dosis to the world:

[

Note  that there were 1 chinese study showing no big impact compared to a  control group (30 people sample but without azithromycine and as I remember, it was not hydroxychloroquine but Chloroquine Phosphate that is proven to require more mg per day to have same efficiency) and also one previous 80 patients study by Didier Raoult  that was less convincing than the numbers he gives now. What the latest  1003 stat shows without doubt is that giving that chloroquine protocol  as early as covid tested and assuming we have this strategy in place and  we don't wait for the covid-19 to evolve into pneumonia/lung  infection/death, then it's confirmed that it reduces mortality rate, and quite sensibly.

All experts currently agree that Covid-19 mortality rate is around 1%. A proactive wide-testing strategy along with hydroxychloroquine-azithromycine seems to show a 0.1% mortality (i would say higher than than, but a good division by 2 or 3 of the mortality rate to reach something manageable by the healthcare systems is doable). Chloroquine protocol decreasing viral charge massively also, it means we could get rid of massive confinment in a futre pandemic and focus on early massive testing and treatment delivery as soon as cases are detected (Korea very low death numbers are partly a reason of that strategy. They were much more prepared because they have suffered massively from the first 10 years old SARS epidemy)

Disclaimer: this is just a news and in no case I am pushing people to buy Chloroquine. I personally only use a plants-based strategy and will act at the earliest symptoms and follow confinement rules (also because I am not in a risky age group). Use your own judgment, document yourself and take the decision that satisfies you.

 Mortality lower than 1%? According to the Guardian, the UK CSM said this morning:  “We have been looking at this right from the outset with very sophisticated mathematical modelling, and we are confident of refining the death rate, the mortality rate, down, and we really think 1% is probably the most accurate figure at the moment ... It may be lower.”

 Confused about the stats From the Guardian:
"England records another 445 deaths, taking death toll to 19,746

A further 445 patients, who tested positive for Covid-19 have died, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 19,746.

NHS England said the patients were aged between 14 and 101 years old. 27 of the 445 patients (aged between 14 and 94 years old) had no known underlying health condition.

The number of deaths of patients with Covid-19 by region are as follows:

East of England 55

London 129

Midlands 96

North East &amp; Yorkshire 72

North West 59

South East 57

South West 16

Total: 475

NHS England and NHS Improvement publish the number of patients who have died in hospital and tested positive for Covid-19 in England.

From 28 April, NHS England and NHS Improvement also reports the number of patient deaths where there has been no Covid-19 positive test result, but where Covid-19 is documented as a direct or underlying cause of death on part 1 or part 2 of the death certification process. This change has been introduced for deaths that occurred on 24th April and subsequently.

This means the NHS England and NHS Improvement data collection provides information on all coronavirus-related (suspected and confirmed) deaths in England hospitals.

Today, 30 deaths are reported with no positive Covid-19 test result."

 When is UK going to release number of recovered and active cases? Without these numbers we have no clue if things get better or not.. I check everyday the statistics for every country. Except UK and Netherlands, rest of the world updates daily the number of recovered and active cases. Not only it gives a trend on the spread, it helps a lot in the moral seeing more people recovering every day.

 Public Health England on Twitter: Counting only those who died within 28 days of a positive #COVID19 test would include 35,664 deaths, and exclude 4,149 deaths in people with laboratory confirmed infection Twitter

 Wales not updating their figures? Just looking, Wales is the only country to not have updated today. Also they apparently only release the number of tests on Thursdays?!  

I'd urge anyone concerned to make a formal complaint, as I have done: Public Health Wales Concerns Team

 Cases not discovered due to NHS guidelines 
This may have been covered before but not that I’ve since I’ve been following this sub. 

If you were to follow NHS 111 guidelines on COVID-19, you had all symptoms but no contact with any confirmed cases and no travel to “affected regions”, you will never be tested unless say you have been hospitalised with severe illness. Now there have been several cases of people contracting the virus in the UK with no known links to either affected areas or confirmed cases, there could be 100’s or thousands of people in the UK with the virus that simply don’t get tested this not reported. 

The NHS need to update their services to accommodate this sooner rather than later.

 Six days ago, a user posted UK vs. Italy death counts. Here are updated death counts reflecting current figures. Remember, we cannot draw conclusions as quickly as we want to, we need to understand data before we make conclusions. This is example of stoking fear without knowing data fully.

 Changes to daily updates? As the cases continue to grow exponentially, will we potentially be given multiple updates every day like other countries such as Germany and France are doing?

Would much rather have two updates spread throughout the day without the 24 hour delay (I believe the numbers we are being given are the confirmed cases for the previous day, correct me if wrong), it would help a lot.

 A note on the case numbers over the past few days &amp;#x200B;

[Cases by date reported \(28\/09\/20\)](

Over the past few days there has been a noticeable decline in the number of reported cases per day, from a height of almost seven thousand three days ago to just over four thousand today. This erratic fluctuation of case numbers is largely due to reporting delays. The chart above shows the reported cases by specimen date. The online dashboard doesn't produce a seven day average on data that is less than eight days old as these figures are not considered final.

Over the next few days, it can be expected that the reporting delays will catch up with the trend seen by the blue line, making 10,000 cases a day quite possible this week.

Stay safe, this ain't over yet.

 Outlying v.low Case Fatality Rate in Germany, Austria and Switzerland ... pondering why? Possibly wrong sub but .... I'm in the UK and its CV19 related...

As these countries are geographically close, I found it curious to note that all 3 have very low case fatality rates relative to their confirmed case numbers.
This has been the case for some days now; I first spotted it last weekend when reviewing the outbreak numbers.

What might be the reason? 
What is else might be common with these countries / populations? 

Germany news media was reporting that the authorities there acknowledge the anomaly but can offer no view as to why.
It was initially postulated that it was due to cases being originally confirmed in returning skiers as that this group being young and healthy. But that postulation doesn't hold valid as time progresses and spread in confirmed cases increases...

 Total weekly deaths in UK Given that we can't be sure all coronavirus deaths are being properly counted, the total deaths should give a better picture.



This graph goes upto 17th April, at which point the official UK figure was 19,093 coronavirus deaths.  In contrast, if we look at the difference in total deaths from week 13 onwards, then 2020 has had 26,943 additional deaths over what would be expected by week 16 of an average year.
