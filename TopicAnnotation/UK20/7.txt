 Moderator Recruitment (2 needed) Hello Everyone, I hope you're all doing well! 

As many have brought to my attention the lack of modding in this sub has become noticeable and when only a few mods are active posts slip through and sometimes cause disruption! As of now I've added 2 New mods! But having 4 or 5 active mods may not be enough as there is nearly 30K people part of our subreddit, so I'm asking for 2 more, in the future I may ask again. 
So anyone who wants to be a mod please comment below and have a little explanation of why you want to be a mod and also include your best qualities!
Only 2 are needed this moment in time!
Thank you, for your continuing support!!

 Click on the hide link underneath a post if you get tired of seeing the same post on this or any other subreddit. Click on the **hide** link underneath a post if you get tired of seeing the same post on this or any other subreddit.

When you go to your account page (by clicking on your user name) you can see them under the **hidden** tab (pretty obvious)

This advice pretty much applies to this post as well.

 3D Printing Ventilator Parts I recently saw this [article]( regarding 3D printing ventilator parts. My University has hundreds of 3D printers that can churn out these parts which is especially good because the engineering department is basically connected to our cities hospital and we're closing down next week so the workshops will be unused and empty (they are still open just unused). I assume lots of Universities around the country will be in a similar position. Does anyone know if these parts are needed on mass/if all ventilators use the same parts as we could be producing hundreds a day if they are something the healthcare system needs.

 Other useful sub for global view For people just arriving here there is an uncensored sub r/Wuhan_Flu that is a good source of information more globally; it was quarantined very early by reddit - kind of ironic.

Reddit wants everyone in a controlled environment of r/coronavirus and r/china_flu where they have been deleting comments and banning people - denying useful information.

One of the active filters on the above subreddits was r/coronavirusuk so basically if you wrote this subs name in there, your post would be deleted as this sub is outside of their control.

The following post details what went on and is still going on there;

To see them still deleting posts - look how many reds there are - the sub has exploded since they are now pushing it on the front page but legitimate posts were being deleted - links to other information outside their influence were deleted etc.
