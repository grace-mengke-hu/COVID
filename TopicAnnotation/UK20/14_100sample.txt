 Eat out to help out - What are your predictions - Orderly behaviour or bedlam and people engaging in fist fights over chicken nuggets? It could go either way - How do you think this 'Eat out to Help out Thing' will pan out?

I am of the opinion that roads will be gridlocked from Monday, cues will form and people will be throthing at the mouth and fighting to get buckets of chicken for 50% of the usual retail price. It will not be pretty people, batten down the hatches and 'bug-out' whilst you still can.

Re-emerge on Thursday-Sunday when the scheme isn't operational, but still 'stay alert' as the occasional brainless fast food addict high on sugary snacks might still be throthing at the mouth and demanding 50% off their order.
