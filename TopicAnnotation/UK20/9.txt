 What about the typical NHS pressures at this time of year in relation to tier decisions? So, I'm in Lincolnshire and unsurprisingly we are in tier 3. 

I understand why the NHS pressure is taken in to consideration for making a decision on tiers, but is this made solely in relation to COVID pressures, or does it factor in typical winter pressures as well?

I'm just wondering as I know our local hospital goes on to divert quite often at this time of year due to lack of bedspace. If it is just a look at pressure on the NHS in general without consideration of the history I need a word with the mother in law to prep her for a real long tier 3 duration.

 Employer edits ACAS guidelines to remove key areas that effect their business to continue work on premises.  A friend works in engineering, the company has already stopped any new orders and has since the outbreak refused work from home.

ACAS guidelines have been released by the company today and are missing key elements of procedures. Checking the company release against the official one has proven that they have redacted sections and embellished others. 

If I get images sent over I will post them in comments. 

Are they breaking the law in doing this?

 Coronavirus: £3bn for NHS to prepare for possible second wave  [ 

&amp;#x200B;

The NHS in England will get an extra £3bn of funding to prepare for a possible second wave of coronavirus, Boris Johnson has announced.

&amp;#x200B;

The funding will also help ease winter pressures on the health service, Downing Street said.

&amp;#x200B;

It follows warnings a second wave this winter could see around 120,000 Covid-19 deaths in UK hospitals.

&amp;#x200B;

The PM made the funding commitment at a Downing Street briefing, where he also pledged a new testing target.

&amp;#x200B;

Under the plans, capacity will be increased to at least 500,000 tests a day by the end of October, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said.

&amp;#x200B;

Confirming the extra £3bn in funding for the NHS in England, Mr Johnson said Covid-19 could become "more virulent" in winter.

&amp;#x200B;

He said: "Demand for testing is not the only challenge that winter will bring. It's possible that the virus will be more virulent in the winter months and it's certain that the NHS will face the usual annual winter pressures."

&amp;#x200B;

He added: "We're making sure we're ready for winter and planning for the worst."

&amp;#x200B;

Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will also receive additional funds, the prime minister added.

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has called for an urgent review into how coronavirus deaths have been recorded in England.

&amp;#x200B;

Downing Street said the new NHS funding would be available immediately and would allow the NHS to continue using additional private hospital capacity and maintain the temporary Nightingale hospitals until the end of March 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

This will provide additional capacity for coronavirus patients, as well as allowing the NHS to carry out routine treatments and procedures, No 10 said.

&amp;#x200B;

Non-urgent operations were suspended as the UK went into lockdown, to free up hospital beds during the first wave of coronavirus - but in May NHS England told hospitals they should restart procedures.

&amp;#x200B;

In normal times an announcement of £3bn to help the NHS in England cope with winter pressures might look generous.

&amp;#x200B;

But these are not normal times as the government pumps tens of billions into the economy to soften the blows of the coronavirus crisis.

&amp;#x200B;

The head of NHS England, Sir Simon Stevens, has been in talks with the Treasury to get guarantees that the Nightingale hospitals can stay open through until next spring in case there is another Covid surge.

&amp;#x200B;

He also wanted secure funding in place to do a deal with private hospitals to help tackle the backlog of cancelled non urgent operations such as hip and knee replacements.

&amp;#x200B;

That money now seems to have been secured, though we await further details.

&amp;#x200B;

The question is, will this be enough to get the health service through what could be one of the most difficult winters in its history?

&amp;#x200B;

There have been predictions that the waiting list for routine surgery will swell to 10 million as fears of a second wave of Covid cases in the depths of winter won't go away.

&amp;#x200B;

A No 10 spokesman said the funding for England was new and not previously allocated; the level of expenditure for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will be set out in due course.

&amp;#x200B;

**Return to work?**

The UK's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance told MPs on Thursday there was "absolutely no reason" to change the government's current guidance on working from home.

&amp;#x200B;

Since late March the government has advised people to work from home if possible to help curb coronavirus.

&amp;#x200B;

But last week Mr Johnson signalled a change, saying: "I think we should now say, well, 'Go back to work if you can'."

&amp;#x200B;

**Second wave fears**

Earlier this week a report, requested by Sir Patrick, called for immediate action to reduce the risks posed by a second wave of coronavirus this winter.

&amp;#x200B;

Among its recommendations were increasing the capacity of the test and trace programme and having more people vaccinated against flu.

&amp;#x200B;

Asked to model a "reasonable" worst-case scenario, scientists suggested a range of between 24,500 and 251,000 virus-related deaths in hospitals alone, peaking in January and February.

&amp;#x200B;

The estimate does not take into account any lockdowns, treatments or vaccines.

&amp;#x200B;

Research suggests the virus can survive longer in colder conditions and is more likely to spread when people spend more time indoors.

&amp;#x200B;

Experts are also concerned the NHS will be under extreme pressure, not just from a resurgence of coronavirus but also from seasonal flu and a backlog of regular, non-coronavirus workload.

&amp;#x200B;

No 10 said the increased prevalence of seasonal illnesses was also likely to increase individual's vulnerability to infection, particularly among the elderly.

&amp;#x200B;

The potential for a rise in other respiratory viruses with similar symptoms also presents challenges for the capacity of the government's test and trace programme, Downing Street added.

&amp;#x200B;

Health Secretary Matt Hancock has already announced plans for the "biggest flu vaccination programme in history", with expanded eligibility criteria expected to be set out shortly.

&amp;#x200B;

**'We need transparency'**

The British Medical Association chairman, Chaand Nagpaul, called for clarity on how the £3b funding will be used.

&amp;#x200B;

"The government talks of winter planning, but we need transparency on this, including how far this money can stretch in tackling a modelled worst-case forecast - including a second peak, additional non-Covid demand and a possible flu outbreak," Dr Nagpaul said.

&amp;#x200B;

"Crucially, the government must make prevention a priority and take every necessary step to try and avoid a national second spike all together."

&amp;#x200B;

NHS Providers, which represents hospitals and other NHS organisations, echoed the call for clarity over what the money will be used for, saying funding is already in place for Nightingale hospitals and private beds.

&amp;#x200B;

While welcoming the financial support, deputy chief executive Saffron Cordery added: "Trusts need more than that. They have got to recover the lost ground of the last four or five months and put measures in place to manage the additional activity that always happens in winter."

 Donate a tin? With the supermarkets allowing the front line staff from nhs etc and elderly  to shop an hour earlier than the rest of us as we've (collectively) bought everything , could we arrange a donation point with supermarkets where we can donate food exclusively for the above as a form of gratitude for their hard work etc in this unprecedented time.

 I have 2 children. One in reception and one in year 1. I know nothing is set in stone but I just cannot have my children being used as Guinea pigs. Karen's kids next door are in year 2 and 4 and from what was said yesterday they will be staying home safe. Why do the government consider some childrens safety more important than others?
