 Is the government really not testing? Looking at the thread with the latest update, I struggle to understand why people are saying the government is not testing? They did 3800+ tests today, with a positive rate of 4-5%. The number of tests is certainly not as high as South Korea's, but the positive rate is not too far from them. We are also doing much better than some other countries which have significantly more cases than us.

The change in testing criteria is one thing that people bring up too. But if they're only testing severe and critical cases, shouldn't that inflate the positive rate? If we test people with a cough and fever, I'm sure we'll get a lower positive rate. The fact that the government has changed the testing criteria and still haven't observed a significant increase in positive rate should be good news.

That doesn't we should let the government off the hook though. They should pursue contact tracing, more surveillance testing and, most importantly, proactive social distancing measures, but on the issue of testing, it appears that we are doing relatively okay.

 COVID19 positive and negative test results?? Hello!  My partner and I both tested negative for COVID19 (he is a key-worker in the military) and it gave advice to us to stay away from those who are positive and we no longer have to self-isolate for 14 days, etc.

We are both curious as to what the message has been to those testing positive for the COVID19 tests?  We would be curious to see what the text-message or email looks like, if anyone has one handy.  My partner is in and out of his workplace all the time so we are both curious as to what the advice looks like to those who tested positive.

Thanks xx

 Monkeys coronavirus free with Oxford university vaccine My last post (with many replies) got removed due to having  "an editorialised the news headline"  mods could have just edited the title rather than delete the post as people spent time replying to it and this is potenitally promising news on coronavirus, something we don't see enough of in this section or in the news in general.

But anyhow, lets try again:-

I  know people will have mixed feelings about testing on animals, but  monkeys being fellow primates and sharing 99% of our DNA, for human  beings this is very promising news indeed!

This vaccine started humans trials last week, so watching this with interest.
