 Complete loss of taste and smell I lost my sense of taste and smell about a week and a half ago. No cough or high temp but shivers, achy, sore throat, and then suddenly I realised I had no taste and smell. Fully recovered from everything but still do not have any taste and smell. 

Interested to see if many other people have - and I'm talking a complete and utter loss of taste and smell
