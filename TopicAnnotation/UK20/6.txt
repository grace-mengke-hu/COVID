 Reporting Breach of COVID Act Without going into too much detail, a colleagues daughter has been leaving her home on multiple occasions to go shopping, visit friends etc yet she is supposed to be self isolating for two weeks having returned from one of the quarantined countries in the EU. Normally I wouldn’t get involved, but she came into the office today to pick something up from my colleague and I saw red. Biting my tongue I am minded to report her to the authorities for flagrantly disregarding the rules. Ultimately she knew the risk of quarantine when leaving the country.

Has anyone reported an individual for breaching home quarantine rules? My main concern is they (the police) will pass on too many details that will identify me as the person who reported her. 

Advice welcomed.

 UK is still obsessed with "Herd Immunity" Apparently they have ordered 3m antibody tests (I didn't even know this test had been made, I never hear anything about antibodies except from UK government).

Antibodies don't even develop immediately after any infection. They seem obsessed not with catching and quarantining but with getting people back to work a.s.a.p.

 Not much talk about colleges going back next week. How are students feeling and have you been given much information? My son is due back Tuesday. He got a text yesterday to tell him they will let him know what procedures are in place and that's it. It's a bank holiday and they still haven't got safety procedures in place for Tuesday.

 Job hunting amidst Coronavirus I have been really struggling with this decision and have been going to multiple people/ posting in a few places hoping some people could help me!

I am being laid off from my current role (a little while ago... so this is not related to COVID-19) and have spent some time job hunting, I have been fortunate to be offered two jobs, one of the jobs seems more 'recession proof' and is offering quite a substantial payrise however is a slight detour from my current career path (albeit a detour I wished to take down the line anyway, more out of interest than out of career progression), the other job is less 'rich' but is offering me some invaluable experience and more importantly a really good work environment. 

I would normally lean towards continuing on my career path and taking the detour further down the line (there are many good reasons for this but not ones I wish to delve too far into) and my gut feeling is telling me to go in this direction with the feeling that staying on my current path will make me more hire-able in a recession/ in general. However with potentially a recession hitting I am now leaning towards the job with the more stable government funded company, even though it takes me away from my projected career path.

What would people here do? 

I have been very lucky to land two jobs before the economy gets worse but I do not wish to go for the role I am less interested in just for economic safety, but perhaps maybe i should?

 Is it possible that - due to people determined to celebrate Christmas - we will see a reduction in cases because people will actively be extra careful on the lead up? Before the Christmas rules even got announced, me and my family had decided we were gonna do it anyway, and our solution was to do a voluntary 2 week isolation before Christmas Day so that we could spend it completely normally and safely. Through WFH and holidays, total safety was/is achievable.

I'm wondering if maybe people - determined not to be forced into self isolation or potentially affect family members - will ramp up their adherence to Covid rules and generally do more social distancing and staying at home, to minimize the awful chance that they catch the virus a few days before Xmas and cannot see family no matter what the relaxed rules are?

Would this potentially result in infections dipping even further before Christmas?

If it was me I certainly would be extra strict with the rules to avoid that possibility, will be interesting to see.

 Best way to donate masks and gloves to hospital without going there in person? I’m asthmatic and I can’t risk going to hospitals now, it’s not much but I have spare two boxes of gloves and masks that might benefit the staff. I’m not sure if there’s any guidelines on whether I am allowed to give it to them. Can anyone help me out please?
