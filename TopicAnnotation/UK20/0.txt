 So why do people wear their masks under their chin? Props to everyone who has been wearing masks responsibly but some people have pulled their masks down so their mouth and nose are clear. The mask sits under their chin.

What is the point of that? Do they think laser particles might fire coronavirus out of their adam's apple? Why not just not wear it?

Are employers requiring people to wear masks but not bothered about them wearing it properly?

I could understand if it were sweltering heat but this was yesterday evening in a grey Scottish evening.

 KN95 mask "non-medical device" Hello,

I have essentially been isolating this whole time due to increased health concerns. However, I will soon have to go out and so I have been looking at what mask I should buy. I have found KN95 masks from a reputable UK seller, but they say "This product is a non-medical device", although it also says the "GB2626-2006 KN95" on it which I believe is a specification? So why do they say non-medical?

Will this kind of mask protect me properly? Should I use FFP2 instead?

 Will I be harassed for wearing a face mask? My mom made me a handmade mask with a filter, and is sending me some N95 masks as well. I want to wear them out, though i am not going out much these days. Will I be harassed while wearing them? Thinking of wearing sunglasses with them so I can avoid eye contact with people.

 Wearing a mask at the barbers/hairdressers? Does anyone wear one? What are people's experiences like of going to the barbers?

Do people getting their haircut actually wear masks? Also can the barbers actually cut your hair properly with a mask?

I want to go to the barbers, but I don't want to be the only customer wearing a mask! Maybe Bojo will  say everyone will have to wear masks in shops like Scotland, then I will know everyone will wear them.

 Wearing cheap face masks with a beard? In Northern Ireland it looks certain that we’ll have to soon wear masks going into shops. I have a cheap reusable mask that I got in Poundland to use but I have a medium length beard (~3 inches below chin) - am I able to still wear a mask with it or will I need to shave it off?

I know some key workers had to be more or less clean shaven but they had higher quality masks, is it a lower standard when it comes to the cloth style masks?

 Why are the government not encouraging mask use? At the moment in the US if you go outside without a mask you're seen as an idiot/asshole who is a bad person for not following the simple task of wearing a face mask.

But here in the UK it is hardly talked about. Very few people in supermarkets I've been to are wearing masks. I included myself in this. I don't feel any need to wear one because there is near zero request from the government or from UK health experts to wear one.

...so what's the deal with this? Are they not that useful (as I remember reading about when this started), or is this a failure of the government to not successfully push the mask message?
