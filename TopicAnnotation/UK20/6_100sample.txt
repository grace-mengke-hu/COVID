 Long term foods will be in short supply soon. I buy some great tinned food from a German company that is pretty big. Anyway they have run out of huge amounts of stock. I’ve never seen that ever. Conserva if anyone’s interested. 

I have a feeling dried food will start running out. Emergency food storage seen tenfold or more increase in orders. They won’t be able to keep up soon. Dried food for backpackers is a great way to go. Full meals and with a bit of salt they are great. Easy to store and last for years. 

Don’t wait. Spend £100-£150 on food storage. And you’ll feel a lot better about it. The stores in Italy lock down area have almost run dry. And other areas experiencing shortfalls in certain goods. 

Do not wait now. It’s coming for certain. It’s just a matter of time. You’ll be left fighting for lentil soup otherwise.

 Secondary Schools - what happens now? So the second wave is incoming with it all kicking off again in a couple of weeks. Ten days isolation now. Kids aren't as infectious - but they aren't kids after puberty so that's 75% of secondary pupils. What will happen come September? Local closures? How will that effect parents or will we end up with thousands of teenagers living like Ferris Buellar home alone? Thoughts? (I'm a dad of teens and a teacher.

 I have been very ill for about a week, now my lungs feel tight and sore. Will I get tested if I ring 111? I have heard of people waiting for hours to speak to someone on 111. I dont want to waste my time if they are not even going to test me. It started with muscle pain and a sore throat but now I have a cough, with slight pain and tightness in my lungs. My head is killing me too and I generally feel awfull have some diarrhea too. My mum also has the same symptoms and is 50. Both of us dont have a temperature. 

Has anyone tried 111 are they actually testing people becuase I have heard things like they are only testing hospital patients. Should we just stay home?

 Couldn't go out with small, low risk group of friends as overwhelmingly anxious. I live in Dorset which has not yet been hammered by infection. The group of friends is small, all young, all are well. Weren't exactly compromising social distancing; were just gonna drive to a beach with no one around and hang out for a bit. Couldn't go because the initial anxiety about the virus opened up a bigger can of worms and I felt I looked too visibly wound up to go (they're my good friends and would understand, but what's the point in going out if I'm just gonna cast this shadow on the evening yknow). I feel stupid and helpless.

 **WHAT*** do you mean ... I've spent a while trying to respond to some comments and posts, taking some time over each, and then find that the other person has an entirely different understanding of terminology, a different perspective (whether that be political, social, whatever), or has just thrown out a careless reactive comment, or one designed to get lots of "likes". 

There's more Americans on this sub than I expected, and we most certainly use different vocabulary, and our political stances vary, and are not directly transferable to the UK situation.

Particular things I've noticed are to do with these terms: "Herd Immunity".  Vaccination, inoculation, and infection.  Percentage.  Risk.  Rate.  (That in particular - are you talking over time, or over transference?).   

Get a mismatch between terminology and the *ad hominen* attacks start to fly: arrogance,  hubris, no compassion, abhorrent, sociopathic, as well as the obscenities. 

I wouldn't expect this sub to necessarily be as precise as /r/COVID19 , where more care is taken to cite sources, and quote accurately - but it certainly makes a discussion rather easier if one does, rather than pointless argument.

 I swear they keep changing what the symptoms are and when to self-isolate and now we don't know what to do! Trying to support my vulnerable mother She's been closely working with someone with a dry cough. Now she's got a very bad headache and is tired.

I swear initially the symptoms were Fever, cough, headache, sore throat = self-isolation. But now everywhere says Fever or cough = self-isolation.

Plus my GF and her family have gone into isolation, and I've been spending time with them. When this started it was self-isolate if you've had contact with someone that's showing symptoms, now they say only if you show symptoms or if that person is a confirmed test. But you don't know if it's a confirmed test because they aren't testing people that can self-isolate...

How can I know what to do if nothing is clear.

 Query on moving to my partner's home during lockdown I'm considering moving to my partner's house after going a bit loopy at mine. Technically as per govt advice, we are currently allowed to move homes if it means we stay there for the remainder of lockdown. 

The only reason I ask, is because my partner's housemate works in a grocery shop and will be interacting with people a few days a week. I'm fairly sure I haven't had the virus, but obviously a lot of cases are asymptomatic and so I'm worried that if I inadvertedly give it to her that she may pass it on to others and so on.

Am I overthinking this? I also volunteer at Samaritans once a week so I'm cautious about not infecting people who also do that too.

 I’ve had a plan ready since early February and been trying to get this out in front of the right people. We need hospital space. Many hospitals have got one or two wards put aside but it’s not going to be enough. We need to get the non critical cases out the hospitals as soon as possible. Having been in events for 20 years we are able to get fully working semi perm structures up and running relatively quickly. Fully operational facilities managed etc. We’ve identified a few sites around the country. 

We’re about to start getting this forward to the NHS now. But if anyone here has contacts or is interested pm me. Initially was looking at creating centres for virus patients but it appears the best plan of action is to free up as much space as possible in hospitals. 

Website up and running. All ready to go. Not advertising just really need to get this out and do some good.

 Schools...is anyone else craving further specifics?! So, we are in Buxton,  Derbyshire and were involved in the initial closure last week (that feels like months ago!).
I find myself craving further information about the plan for school closures. What is the magic number when mass school closures become an imminent reality?! People need to make suitable arrangements and plan for this. I guess I'm a solid specifics type of gal; which possibly is an impossibility in this current situation. 
I can't believe that we have had no further cases in Buxton following that initial one. Makes me wonder how many people are just carrying on and assuming they have a cold! We don't have anybody at risk of further complications in our home, as such I'm not excessively worried about the virus, more concerned about the ensuing chaos and panic.

 my community is encouraging. i see a post about panic buys and how the people of the UK are selfish arseholes - and well its hard to argue that he is wrong, but he is wrong about EVERYONE.

i went home yesterday to a postcard through my door from a neighbor offering their services if we need to self isolate, i see posts from teachers offering child care and multiple posts from people offering help.

above that we have all the NHS staff who i trust with my life, not because i HAVE too but because i know that they are genuine heros and will do everything in their power for me and my loved ones. then we have police, firefighters and in these days even your asda checkout staff and shelf stackers all continuing on at personal risk.

ill be printing post cards off tonight to offer to my neighbours to see if i can help them and ill be there if i possibly can be. ill be looking out for other ideas as to how i can help in this shitty situation.

while i cant argue the panic buying is pure stupid and inconsiderate, it is a few (admittedly clean) arseholes ruining for the rest of us. im not gonna lose faith in everyone just yet.

 High Risk List Criteria? A question for people better versed in this than me.

What exactly does it take to get onto the high-risk list?

I ask because a nurse at my dad's GP has just told him that their system says he's not high risk. But he's 72, overweight, has permanent lung damage from 40+ years of working around cars, asthmatic (to a point that it's put him in hospital multiple times for weeks at a time and he carries a nebulizer everywhere he goes as well as the pumps), and is diabetic.

They've told him that he can ring and query it with a GP, but I just fail to see how he doesn't qualify automatically. 

We weren't worried initially because my mum was furloughed and I'm not working, but my mum's work has started the "right, we'll probably be open in a few weeks, who has people on the high-risk list in their household?" stuff, and because he hasn't had the letter, she can't actually say that he is, and realistically, I've been out of work 2 months, so I'll need to find something when things start easing up.

Is there anything he should really say to the GP other than the above?

 THE SIMPLE FACT YOU ALL SEEM TO BE MISSING HERE.... If this country goes into full lockdown, our economy will die. It's that simple. We are already seeing the beginning of the collapse. This is a far greater threat to everyones survival than the Coronavirus.

The Government know this and know the only way the country can survive is to get the outbreak over and done with as quickly as possible. Mass infection in one massive hit. 

Yeah they have dressed it up with fancy words (herd immunity) for the dumbed masses but mass infection is what it is. Some might argue it is a controlled spread but it isnt. That would require extensive testing in order to detect and control it (aka South Korea) which isn't happening here. 

It may seem like I am arguing against this but I have realised that they are right. This virus is so contagious that it is unstoppable without Chinese style lockdowns. The only viable alternative is to take it on the chin in one massive hit that will overwhelm us for several weeks but will allow us to start recovering much sooner. 

You see once you as a country go into lockdown, you need to stay in lockdown until the number of new cases are 0. Otherwise you simply start another wave of infection and end up in an even more fucked position.

Look at Italy. They have destroyed their economy already with their lockdown and quarantine. Their lockdown could last indefinitely. It is only a matter of time before the country descends into chaos. They will not be able to recover from this. The rest of Europe isn't far behind them.

That is why we have not and can not go into lockdown. All these posts about why aren't they closing this, why aren't they closing that - Because mass infection. They want you to catch it, they need you to catch it and spread it. Infact we all need as many people to catch this and spread it as far as possible.

Mass infection, one big hit is the only way. We need to get this outbreak over with as quickly as we possibly can so we can start recovering. Yes it is surreal that this is happening but it is time to wake up and start accepting the reality of the situation.

The NHS is going to collapse. A lot of at risk people who catch this are going to die. We are about to be brought to our knees as a country as this thing blasts it way through. That is why it is so important right now that anyone who is at risk (60+, immunocompromised, etc), need to stay the fuck home. Do not catch this as help might not be there for you.

Our Government didn't miss the boat on containment, they just accepted from the start that it wasn't possible. The current one hit strategy was decided on as far back as January with the media instructed to downplay and under report the situation to avoid the panic buying we have seen in the last few weeks (or since the media have actually started covering the outbreak).

I have been tracking this Coronavirus since early January. I watched it leave China and slowly creep it's way into and across Europe. I can feel it in the air now that it's getting closer to me. It is only a matter of time before it will arrive with its full fury in my town. And yours if it isn't there already. 

Good news is most of us will get the mild version that does not require hospitalisation and allows for full recovery. Vit C and Vit D are highly recommended as a precaution and potential treatment if you can get some although I am not a doctor, just some crazy guy who no-one has listened to over the last three months. 

Accuse me of being a scare monger if you want, I don't care as that isn't the intention of this post. People need to accept the situation we are in, accept that shit is going to get real intense for a few weeks and there will be tragedy but push through and be ready to come out the other side and get this country up and running again. Otherwise we are all completely fucked.

 Booking Concert Tickets Hello all,

I'm considering buying concert tickets as a gift for my mum for Christmas, the concert is due to happen in May (I think it's the 12th but I'll have to check). We've all been very worn down by this year and our mental health has seriously suffered, so this will be a lovely thing to count down to (I was literally going to start a countdown).

I am 90% sure the concert will go ahead as planned, and with the current vaccine timetable of everyone being done by the end of March, I think there's a 50/50 chance that it might be a thing of the past by then. More realistically, I suspect we might still be wearing masks and there could be some social distancing.

I think the worst case scenario of tiers still being in place and everything getting cancelled is incredibly unlikely, but it does worry me. Anyone here want to give their thoughts??

 Your thoughts: I am 6 months pregnant, due in August. Realistically, I can't see a way in which I won't need to self-isolate for the remainder of the pregnancy. Opinions please. Morning folks.

Given the government's advice that pregnant women should self-isolate for 12 weeks as of 16th March, but with no immediately clear exit strategy to our current situation, I've come to the conclusion (somewhat slowly, I'll admit - blame it on the baby brain!) that it's highly likely that I'll need to self-isolate for not just the advised 12 weeks - which we are currently halfway through - but the remainder of my pregnancy.

Do you agree? Or have I missed something blindingly obvious? Just looking for opinions in order to plan ahead for my baby and my business and, well, life.

Thanks!

 Even in the chance that we do actually get a second wave, I don’t believe we will be put into a second lockdown.

Boris cannot afford to do this again, and I don’t think he will.  

I think the very worst they might do is backtrack on a few small things and remind people to ‘stay alert’.

 Subreddits response to Boris Obesity message I'm a bit confused by the general subreddits positive response to Boris recently calling out the nations obesity problem as the main reason for the high death toll.

Now this is far from me saying there isn't an obesity problem, and that obesity isn't a factor in how impacted a person with Coronavirus may be, however every other method used by the government to deflect the blame back onto the British public has been met with large criticism and a 'they're trying to start us blaming each other' mentality, or 'they're deflecting from their poor handling' response.

Then yesterday Boris comes out and points it at the nation being too fat and saying people should cycle to work (while the nation works from home) and suddenly nobody is calling this out as deflection and is of the opinion that Boris finally gets it.

Why isn't this being noted as yet another attempt to misdirect from their entirely inept handling of the pandemic?

 An estimate Helloo!

You all seem on top of everything info wise and I figured you could give me an estimate of something.

So, when would you guess we will be able to not social distance with say a S/O from another household? 

Thank you, and i hope you are all safe and well :)

 People need to stop being so fucking selfish! Pretty much all the gyms near me have shut down and done the right thing but theres 1 or 2 that are making a big point about staying open.... So basically what they’re saying is  “Were open, give us your money, everyone come here and lets pack the place out, and we don’t really give a fuck if you catch this virus”... i understand peoples business is going down but we need to start putting peoples health before business so we can speed up the process of us ALL getting back to normal.. The sooner people start thinking wisely then the sooner everyone can have their business back up and running. Cannot believe how stupid some people are being at a time like this. WAKE UP!

 Self isolating but husband works in a hospital. I'm so terrified, I apologise for my panic running my mouth but I need to shout into the void about this and hope.

I am 33, female, very underweight and immunocompromised from Crohn's disease and the medication for it. I have a 4 year old daughter, normal weight for her age, with a mild heart condition (ventricular septal defect - 3mm).

We are self isolating for months as far as I can tell. My daughter has a disgusting cold and cough. Because of the runny nose and sneezing and her generally running about and being fine in herself I dont suspect C19. I have not shown any symptoms personally but am isolating us as a precautionary measure as I do not believe we are safe.

My husband, however, is of the "Oh, we will be fine, it's just the flu" etc. As far as I know the flu does not shut borders, cause quarantines and talks of requisitioning hotels as hospitals and repurposing peoples jobs to make ventilators. He intends to go to his D&amp;D game group tonight, still attends work etc. He works in a hospital as non medical staff in HR...but he will still come into contact with doctors. Doctors obviously are in close contact with patients and I'm not hearing good things about NHS hygiene practice at this time. Lack of hand sanitiser and people still coming to work with symptoms.

What would you do? I don't want to be near him. I don't want our daughter near him. But of course we all live in the same house and I am so very frightened his blasé attitude and denial are going to get us killed.

I know he thinks I'm massively overreacting but I don't believe anyone is safe. I feel it's a massive unnecessary risk for everyone for him to be out and about like this but he won't listen. 

I believe he needs to isolate with us and even then I will only calm down after 2 weeks at minimum have passed and none of us show symptoms. I intend to distance myself as best I can and keep our daughter with me. Thankfully he spends most of his time on his gaming computer upstairs away from us anyway.

Is there anything else I can possibly do to keep safe apart from the hand washing and trying to remove myself and my daughter from as much close contact as possible? Am I actually overreacting or am I the high risk I believe myself to be?
