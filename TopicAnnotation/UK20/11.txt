 High BP meds/Diabetes meds and Ibuprofen can increase your chance of fatal complications ''ACE2 can also be increased by thiazolidinediones and ibuprofen. These data suggest that ACE2 expression is increased in diabetes and treatment with ACE inhibitors and ARBs increases ACE2 expression. Consequently, the increased expression of ACE2 would facilitate infection with COVID-19. **We therefore hypothesise that diabetes and hypertension treatment with ACE2-stimulating drugs increases the risk of developing severe and fatal COVID-19''**

 OPINIONS: Treatment of students. This is a discussion to see what people think on the treatment of university students. Just for reference, I am entering my 3rd year of university so have personal experience of how this pandemic is affecting me. 

This is mainly in regards to how students have been locked down across the Manchester Met across the whole campus, wether or not a flat has it. Surely this is lethal to the mental health of students, who will have to lock down every time a flat member gets tested positive? 

The online learning is a big letdown for myself personally too (call me selfish but I am discussing purely the effects on university students and their treatment). I do a business degree where the main module is to operate our own business; I will not be given the personal support and access to my office which I was promised when enrolling. 

I understanding the rule of 6 and 10PM curfew could be mainly to curb the partying of students. I get this is to stop the spread, but students will party on anyway, and day drink earlier. And from what I’ve seen, many students at my university have spilled out onto the streets at 10, leaving thousands of young people congregating at the same time on the high street. Surely this is counter productive? Cancel the curfew, and allow students to leave bars and pubs at staggered times. 

Let me know.

 University students: What are your Coronavirus plans? So, what are your plans? 

I’m a university student and I was wondering what are you (students) doing? Have you skipped lectures ever since coronavirus was announced? My uni keeps on nagging us about attendance figures for seminars, etc. But boohoo, i think its time to take a hit on attendance. Smh.

So yeah, I was curious, what are you guys doing? Skipping lectures and seminars and using lecture capture to complete your notes? Are you planning to test yourself then go back home, if cases do continue to increase? Or, isolate yourself in your flat/house?

 Covid support for university students Does anyone know what’s happening with universities? The government is only speaking about small children and the actual universities don’t know either. My question is, when is university starting back? 


For context September 2020 would be the start of my first year.
