 Here’s a roundup of information and links regarding Schools and Education in regards to the coronavirus. 
Lots of people are necessarily concerned about what will happen in our schools. Personally, I’m worried about the summer exams timetable, as my son is in year 11.

The Government’s [general advice]( is that schools should remain open unless Public Health says otherwise. 

Schools in the UK are preparing [online learning resources,]( work ready for pupils to take home and cancelling events as they brace for potential closures due to coronavirus.

[UK schools and offices could close for up to two months](

[Will shutting down UK schools stop coronavirus? It’s complicated.](

Information about [UK school closures]( including which schools have closed.

[What schools and colleges do]( if the exam season is disrupted? More [here.](

[Why are some schools closing?](

Schools told [no delay to exams]( so far.

[One School asks parents to clean toilets to stop outbreak](


[Schools could be forced ]( to take extra pupils.

[The Department for Education has set up a group]( to help universities resist the coronavirus.

Please feel free to add any links you think are helpful in the comments and I’ll update the post.

 Partial school closure advice So my kids high school have sent letters home saying they are partially closing their school due to teacher shortage for yr 10, 12 and 13 but its been in the news that the school is actually suffering a covid outbreak affecting about 20 pupils and staff. 

This hasn't been communicated to us as parents.

Should we have parents been told?
What can i do with my kids to protect them ? 

Any help / advice would be appreciated.

 Seriously? Am I missing something? ANOTHER school trip to northern italy and these have gone!  [ 

WTF?? How desperate are these kids for a ski trip and have the parents no fucking sense at all? Perhaps i'm just an over protective parent, but this is just so beyond my comprehension... I just cant

 TL/DR From the Junior school. School will only reopen if national rate of infection falls and school is confident that conditions are as safe as they can make them for children, staff and parents.

Start 2nd June for Reception, Y1 and Y6.

Bubbles of 15 kids with allocated teachers.  

Each class split into 2 bubbles, one attending Monday and Tuesday, the other Thursday and Friday.

Wednesday school cleaned.

Home learning to continue.

Two weeks and then reviewed.

Children given space and not to have contact with each other, but small children will probably find this difficult.

If you chose to send your kid, you need to understand this.

Staggered start and end times, breaks and lunchtimes.

No parents allowed in school, all comms via email and phone.

Manage expectations of kids returning.

No obligation to send kids back.  No penalties.

 Secondary Schools - what happens now? So the second wave is incoming with it all kicking off again in a couple of weeks. Ten days isolation now. Kids aren't as infectious - but they aren't kids after puberty so that's 75% of secondary pupils. What will happen come September? Local closures? How will that effect parents or will we end up with thousands of teenagers living like Ferris Buellar home alone? Thoughts? (I'm a dad of teens and a teacher. We're all desperate to get back to school. I HATE WFH - my hours are longer, my computer equipment is dreadful, no garden and arsey bored kids.)

 Huge queue for tests after outbreak at pub where 200 crowded into beer garden

 Can parents get fined if they sent their child into school knowing that had symptoms? So the situation is, I get a phone call from my child, saying he needs picking up from school. This was literally 5 mins before he would have got the school bus. 
But do to him being close proximity of another pupil who has a confirmed case, he wasn’t allowed to get the bus home.

He knows who the pupil was, because he was asked if he came into close contact. 
But what annoys me is that the pupil was in school today. So the parents knowingly sent their kid to school whilst awaiting the results of a COVID test.
The level of irresponsible is shocking. But could they get fined for this?
I expect the school would deny this was the case. 
But the last minute dash around and panic from the school would suggest to me that the pupil has been in school. Mixing with others and potentially spreading it now.

Not happy with it all. Nothing I can do granted. But now have both kids off school. No point them going back, as they will be breaking up for school only a week after returning now.
