 Anyone else had outpatient appointment in June cancelled? I thought that the NHS and hospitals were supposed to be returning to normal again and seeing patients for 'normal' illnesses?

Just received a message that my appointment has been cancelled in the middle of June, this is after I was seen in the middle of April as an emergency, not a &amp; e but the outpatients department I require. The June app is a follow up to that and one that was supposed to look at changing things to help me long-term with my issue. 

Just feel forgotten about right now, has anyone else had appointments in June cancelled? Really wish the NHS wasn't such a postcode lottery.

 If the world fails to protect the economy, COVID-19 will damage health not just now but also in the future

 I really don’t think the lockdown should be lifted until this disease is eradicated. This disease is highly contagious and so if we lift the lockdown before it’s eradicated we will just go back to square 1 and end up in lockdown again anyway (at least I hope the govt would introduce another lockdown if we did rather than copying Sweden’s idiotic policy next time). 


Allowing the country to open up whilst covid 19 still exists is the eugenicist attack on the people for the Tories and their business sponsors; our health should mean more than the economy and Karen can have her haircut when this horrible pandemic is over.

 Have I already had covid-19? I work in hospitality and I've got sick on the 3rd of February, 7 days after the Chinese new year. We had plenty of visitors from China, one I recall being visibly sick at the time.

Initial symptoms: periodic sharp pain in the chest/lungs. Didn't read much into it. 

Then out of nowhere  I felt like I was hit by a truck. Couldn't sleep all night, I was sweating, my body was aching and shaking.

I have developed the most painful sore throat of my life the next day, felt too tired to move, couldn't eat and I was still shaking.

This state persisted for another 3 days with additional diarrhoea and low grade fever on day 3 and 4. Then I started to develop a chesty cough, which got worse over night. It reminded me for the time I had pneumonia. However, this only lasted for 3 days.

By day 8 I felt quite alright, except the tiredness, lack of appetite and runny nose. This was a new symptom which was not present earlier. I also started to be constantly dizzy, couldn't walk straight, couldn't hold anything in my hands for long and felt weak in general.

The symptoms of dizziness lasted for another week, all other symptoms were gone.

I never experienced such a sudden and forceful illness before, my pneumonia back in the day was much more gradual.

What do you think? Is it possible that coronavirus was in the UK in the end of January?

 Simple infographics or videos to help convince an elderly person to self-isolate? I was wondering whether anyone might be able to help me. I want to convince my 100 year old grandfather that he ought to self isolate. Unfortunately he is as stubborn as a mule and doesn't seem to understand the importance of minimising contact with others. I think he is of the view that he beat the Nazis so he'll beat a bit of flu. He is in about as good shape as you can be at 100. He lives on his own and still drives - Yesterday he visited my aunt and today he came round to our house despite our protestations. He has stopped going to the supermarket by himself now at least. 

Does anyone have a simple infographic or short video that I could show him to help explain the situation? We are at out wits end now trying to explain this to him. He is a smart man and still switched on but set in his ways. 

Thanks so much.

 Why is everything in the news so depressing all of a sudden? The headlines we have seen this week have been a total rollercoaster.

‘Second Peak expected in winter’ followed by ‘Oxford vaccine appears successful’ now, today, followed by ‘UK will be living with Coronavirus for years, if not decades’.

The last one is really the one I want to talk about. The BBC published an article today which made me fucking depressed as shit. I had had a good day as well, so this was a huge blow.

Are we really going to be living how we are now for decades, with social distancing made a permanent rule?

I just want to live a normal life, where you don’t have to constantly distance yourself and you are free to hug your family and friends as much as you want. 

I fear we won’t even be able to have proper Christmas: NYE celebrations this year with family, something I think a lot of people will need and deserve after a year like this.

 My parents are stranded abroad, can anyone advise on how to get them home? Hi everyone, will be brief: my parents are stranded abroad and the local airports are locked down so there are no commercial flights available for them to get home. They're with a group of around 50 people, many of whom are elderly with underlying health conditions. They can't leave the hotel they've been put up in and they're being fed, thankfully, but obviously need to get home ASAP.

I've been in touch with their local MP who is trying to help, and my parents are in contact with the British embassy where they are, but nothing has come to fruition. Apparently, the US citizens got a flight home yesterday but nothing has been put in place for them and the other British citizens.

Can anyone advise on what my/their next steps could be? They've touched base with ITV to hopefully get an interview on the news later to raise awareness of the situation but does anyone have any pointers on what I can do from here in the UK or who to contact? I've never dealt with anything like this so any information would be gratefully received. Thanks so much x

 Potential new job, would need to use public transport The company I'm at currently, I've been there for a few years and I'm currently on furlough. Since April it's been furlough / work from home / furlough / work from home, half the company doing it one month, the other half doing the following month. I don't know when we will be back in the office. 

I've been offered another job, it's in the city centre like my current job but it would require training and I'd need to be in the office full time. It's a better salary, and more prospects and progression. My current job, it's likely it'll be a long time before I get a pay rise and I can't move anywhere within the company. 

What's stopping me from accepting the new position is my reluctance to use public transport, due to the virus. I don't drive, was taking lessons before the pandemic but that's on hold for now. I'm also concerned in case a second lockdown happens before I start the new position, because then I'm in limbo if I've resigned from my current place of work. 

Am I being stupid here? This opportunity may never come my way again, but these two things are worrying me.

 Social Distancing is not working Everyone talks a good game about social distancing to halt this virus however lots of companies are telling their staff to attend work as normal. It's ok for the executives to work from home but the people on the ground are expected to still travel by 2-3 buses and to get to work and then do the same when they go home. The PM and Major of London have both said that people should only travel when really really essential.

I work for a property management company and manage a high end flats in central London with about 200 flats (so approx 500 -600 people live there). My team consists of myself, concierge, cleaners and handymen and we are all expected to travel through London and attend work as normal.

Now I don't believe that concierge to deal with parcel delivery, collecting dry cleaning, accepting Deliveroo orders. Cleaners dusting the residents lounge and a handyman sweeping up leaves are essential work! Until the PM or someone in authority defines what "essential" is actually defined as then companies are going to continue putting people in danger and continuing the spread of the COVID-19 virus.

The residents have also started to complain after I closed the areas containing gym/swimming pool/sauna/steam rooms and jacuzzis following government orders on Friday. They state that this is not a busy public area and can be managed.... Oh how the other half live in their ridiculous bubble.

Clarity and strong actions are required by the government so that it is clear what people should do and companies won't continue the spread of this killer virus.

 Timeline for shielding... and how to get a delivery! Hi all,

So today I got my “stay at home for 12 weeks” letter. 

It advises me to stay at home from today, yet the first batch of letters went out 3 weeks ago. So do I have to shield for 3 more weeks than others? Seems odd the first wave will be released quicker than the second. (Here’s hoping it doesn’t get extended!)

Thanks and stay healthy! X

 Unpopular opinion - I’m tired of seeing NHS staff (particularly those who aren’t even doctors or nurses) showing off their freebies on social media. I think it’s in kinda poor taste to constantly spam Instagram and Facebook to show off their free coffees and their free lunches etc and all their other perks and discounts to other people when we’re in the middle of a pandemic and thousands have lost their jobs and are struggling for money. 

Someone - who I just unfollowed - was posting a picture of their free coffee every morning and then shared a picture of a free pizza that they got donated by a local takeaway and then this morning literally shared a screenshot of someone praising the NHS on Twitter and basically taking the opportunity to thank everyone for their endless support and messages.....the last time I spoke to the guy after Christmas he was at the orthodontist desk doing admin duties. 

Anyone who is a key worker and having to risk catching the virus should be getting free stuff and discounts as well, but somehow I can’t see call centre workers and bus drivers and cleaners and supermarket staff being allowed this can you?

 I hope when this is over the question of why PPE was not available when needed will be asked again and again until an answer is given There really is no excuse for the NHS to be seemingly having such an issue with providing PPE to front line workers.

after SARS, MERS and various other issues, we should have been ready for a pandemic, at least to the extent of keeping a proper stockpile of masks, scrubs, etc.

Surely it would have been sensible to have a national stock that is then rotated out into normal use as new stock comes in, so that there is always a ready supply in such a case. Trying to buy in on the open market when other countries are already suffering and competing for the same product is clearly a stupid idea.

So is there a *good* reason I'm missing?

My suspicion is currently money (some recent headlines about ignored warnings tend to show this), but that is NOT a good reason.

There has also clearly been a decline in contingency planning on a national scale since the end of the cold war, but this is something that should have been simple and relatively cheap to organise.

 Second death in the UK and this government couldn't care less Matt Hancock said "again, somebody who was older and had underlying health conditions." 

So? This man was 80. My grandad died at 94 and had a good life up to that point. This man was robbed of potentially more years. 

The only slightly positive thing that may come out of this is more people realise how little the government care about us, especially the old and vulnerable. 

How many more people need to die before this virus is taken seriously by our government? Will it take a young person dying from it for them to take action? But by then it will be too late.

 They stood by and watched... Our NHS are making visors from plastic bottles, they are begging for PPE and several health trusts have approached a medical fetish website for scrubs. We are begging manufacturers to switch to making ventilators and our doctors and nurses are reporting having to re-use masks.

I am not an epidemiologist. I was a paramedic for many years before retiring due to an ankle injury that meant I could no longer lift heavy weights. Now, I am a professional photographer, nothing more.

I saw this coming. Before Wuhan went into lock down, in the middle of January, I heard and read of this novel coronavirus. I saw the terrible combination of it being deadly and virulently infectious. I knew what was coming, instinctively. I prepared early. Stocking up on supplies and just enough PPE to see me through. I am in the vulnerable category now and not the fit and healthy paramedic I once was.

Before January was over I watched China lock down entire cities, I saw them quarantine 150 million people. Videos of many more body bags than the daily official death figures could explain. Whistleblowers reporting on crematoria operating 24/7 and citizen journalists suddenly disappearing. I saw fleets of vehicles and armies of Tyvek-suited people spraying the air and the streets with chemicals and then China started building hospitals, from scratch. Built in days, the hospitals were for 1000s of patients. Hotels and conference halls were converted into quarantine centres. They forced manufacturers to switch to making masks, gloves and protective suits. The severity of the epidemic on their hands was blatantly obvious.

I saw all of this and wondered what our Government and NHS were doing to prepare. They surely saw this coming too. If I could see it, how could they not see it? Yet here we are. Two months after it was obvious to me that a 1918-like pandemic was on the way and our Government and NHS are just now scrabbling around to get prepared with what they need.

What on earth were the experts, epidemiologists and government advisers doing? Were they waiting for the WHO to actually declare a pandemic? Time was squandered and the only result will be more death, death that could have been prevented to some degree.

Did they stand by and watch...?

 Public Health England Not Protecting Dentists And Endangering Patients Public Health England (PHE) seem to have forgotten about protecting and providing clear information for Dentists which are at high risk of exposure to the virus. The amount of people a dentist can unknowingly pass it on to is huge!

GP practices have started to implement procedures such as over the phone consultations only but to my surprise Dental practices are continuing to operate normally with just posters displayed. Many dentists I know are extremely worried by this - as some in the community branch deal mainly with the high risk groups.

PHEs apparent latest advice is for dental practices to refer patients who are emergencies who have symptoms to the community branch of the service! 

This is potentially catastrophic as the community branch hasn't been provided with personal protectice equipment (PPE) and primarily deal with high risk groups (elderly etc).

This seems to be a massive oversight by PHE - has anyone got any information on what their local dentists are doing? 

A dentist I know had someone turn up the other day with symptoms, lie about them only to leave saying they've had a bit of a fever but the dentist will be fine as they're young - the selfishness of some is unbelievable!

 What’s on your self-isolation to do list? Hello everyone!

I work in hospitality and my company decided to remain open, although they are now planning to close at the weekend. Around 75% of our customers are in the at risk demographic and should really be at home, cosseted in the safety of their houses. As an employee, I felt caught between the desire for people to do what they’ve been told for their own safety, worry for my job and concern for my own health (I have very bad asthma). However, life has a way of intervening and yesterday evening I began to cough. And such a cough it is! Honestly, I sound like a dog barking. Luckily no fever or shortness of breath. But obviously I am now at home with my husband for the next 14 days.

With this in mind, I have come up with a to do list. Most of it hinges on how well I am feeling over the coming days, but in an ideal world this is what I’m planning to do:

1. Have a lay in (first one this year)
2. Garden
3. Paint woodwork on landing
4. Finishing making my nephews quilt
5. Sort and clean kitchen cupboards
6. Finishing reading the books I bought for holiday last year
7. Re-silicone around the bath and shower tray
8. Paint the garden gate
9. Deep clean my car 
10. Practice my saxophone 
11. Do an online history course
12. Sort through my fabric stash and start another quilt

I think my list is rather dull so I’d be interested to hear how other people are filling their time? What jobs have you been putting off for years? Any suggestions for other things I can do?

Stay safe everyone.

If there is no significant herd immunity it makes zero sense to let people go back to normal life.

 Self isolating but husband works in a hospital. I'm so terrified, I apologise for my panic running my mouth but I need to shout into the void about this and hope.

I am 33, female, very underweight and immunocompromised from Crohn's disease and the medication for it. I have a 4 year old daughter, normal weight for her age, with a mild heart condition (ventricular septal defect - 3mm).

We are self isolating for months as far as I can tell. My daughter has a disgusting cold and cough. Because of the runny nose and sneezing and her generally running about and being fine in herself I dont suspect C19. I have not shown any symptoms personally but am isolating us as a precautionary measure as I do not believe we are safe.

My husband, however, is of the "Oh, we will be fine, it's just the flu" etc. As far as I know the flu does not shut borders, cause quarantines and talks of requisitioning hotels as hospitals and repurposing peoples jobs to make ventilators. He intends to go to his D&amp;D game group tonight, still attends work etc. He works in a hospital as non medical staff in HR...but he will still come into contact with doctors. Doctors obviously are in close contact with patients and I'm not hearing good things about NHS hygiene practice at this time. Lack of hand sanitiser and people still coming to work with symptoms.

What would you do? I don't want to be near him. I don't want our daughter near him. But of course we all live in the same house and I am so very frightened his blasé attitude and denial are going to get us killed.

I know he thinks I'm massively overreacting but I don't believe anyone is safe. I feel it's a massive unnecessary risk for everyone for him to be out and about like this but he won't listen. 

I believe he needs to isolate with us and even then I will only calm down after 2 weeks at minimum have passed and none of us show symptoms. I intend to distance myself as best I can and keep our daughter with me. Thankfully he spends most of his time on his gaming computer upstairs away from us anyway.

Is there anything else I can possibly do to keep safe apart from the hand washing and trying to remove myself and my daughter from as much close contact as possible? Am I actually overreacting or am I the high risk I believe myself to be?

 self isolating for cough/fever? I'm not as knowledgable on the subject as a lot of you and I'm a little confused. I've seen that we're expected to self quarantine for a week if we have a continous cough or fever - but schools and workplaces are still open and they're no longer testing anyone who doesn't need to be hospitalised? My friend has a cough atm but she can't exactly take a week off work everytime she shows similar symptoms to COVID19, and since they've restricted testing how are you ever supposed to know for sure unless you end up in hospital and cant go to work anyway? All I'm thinking of is workplaces like the one my friend works at with 100+ people, a lot of whom are coughing and aren't being sent home. Another friend of mine works in food where a manager is suspected of being in contact with someone with coronavirus, yet the store remains open and both of my friends are wary to ASK for time off because the management really think it's no big deal. I just think it's a bit poor they won't take action to lockdown like most other countries yet expect us to just be able to stay off work anyway for a week for having symptoms of coronavirus.

 How have the government checked on your quarantining? When returning from countries not on the quarantine exempt list, how have the government checked that people are quarantining by the rules?

I'm looking for anecdotal stories mainly.

 Using public transport? My two older sons have not seen their dad since the lockdown (it takes a bus and a train to get to him) we both have younger kids and they thought it was best not to see the children

Restrictions have been lifted a bit however I’m not sure I should be jumping on a bus and train with them again? 

I don’t drive but I have said since the beginning of this if he can drive down and collect them, he can have them, but I don’t want to risk infecting both households by using public transport 

Am I being too over the top? My partner isn’t working yet but could be going back soon, if that happens I’ll have to take all 4 kids with me which would mean the risking them too.

I don’t know if I’ve just got use to the “stay at home” message or if I’m sensible about this?

He hasn’t asked to see them, he had a week where he’d call them everyday and play online games via Xbox but he’s not done much since then, just wanted to get some opinions before he mentions something 

Thanks

 KN95 mask "non-medical device" Hello,

I have essentially been isolating this whole time due to increased health concerns. However, I will soon have to go out and so I have been looking at what mask I should buy. I have found KN95 masks from a reputable UK seller, but they say "This product is a non-medical device", although it also says the "GB2626-2006 KN95" on it which I believe is a specification? So why do they say non-medical?

Will this kind of mask protect me properly? Should I use FFP2 instead?

 Disgusting. The Jewelary Channel (TJC) based in the UK is selling masks, 5 for £8. They have a stock of 2100 left and already sold 9000. These could have gone to our NHS.

 Anyone know a company who has recieved it's furlough wages from the government yet. We were told if they applied on the 20th then they would receive the wages 6 days later. I'm asking because my boss said that we wouldn't get it before May but they were going to apply when the site opened. When it did we were told it would take 6 days by the government. My boss has went super quiet on this and won't respond to people. Is there anyway I can find out from HMRC or does all that follow under data protection. 

Thanks for any help

Hope your all staying safe and sane

 Are you seeing any price increases? Fetch, who deliver pet food always would deliver for free for orders over £30.

Now it is £6.99, no matter the size of the order. 

£9.99 if under £30.

 Can anyone remember a minister recently listing the likelihood of death from covid19 across the UK? I'm going mad trying to find a recent government update clip which I watched on my phone, it was from the UK. 
It was an older gentleman (politician/minister), at the now very familiar podium in downing street. He was basically listing the likelihood and severity of infection across the broad spectrum of UK society. 
It was a refreshing list, in light of all the usual fear. 
By that I mean he listed the likelihood of dying as being very low for most people, he talked through bullet points which sounded something like this:

- Many people will not become infected at all.
- Of those who do become infected, many will experience no symptoms.
- Of those who do experience symptoms, the vast majority will be mild, comparable to a cold.
-Of those who do experience more severe symptoms, most will still not require hospital treatment...

The list went on to describe the more at risk people, elderly with underlying issues etc...

I can't find the clip from this particular, (and recent) UK Covid update briefing. I have to admit my ignorance for not knowing which minister it was, I would say Gove but I think the guy was older and grayer than Gove. 

I wanted to find this clip because I know friends/folks who are alone in the UK and very frightened/isolated with their TV's.... healthy people over 50.
They never seem placated by my reassurance that they are not going to die if they just go outside for a walk. That it's not quite as deadly (as the media can make it appear) if you are in good health and have no underlying issues, plus observe the distancing rules.

Does anyone have any idea what I'm referring to, and even better, a link to his part of the briefing??

Thanks in advance :)

 Workplace health and safety. A friend of mine works for a company that all of a sudden have stopped all COVID health and safety due to lots of big orders. Everyone in the warehouse seem to be ok with the situation or to scared to say anything. The HS reps also have turned a blind eye to it.
He has checked the HSE website but have to give details about yourself, which will probably lead to dismissal. Any ideas ??

 Creative ways in which different businesses/social norms can be adapted to post lockdown times! Ideas? Not sure if this post belongs here, if anyone knows of a different thread this post would be more suitable please let me know. 

I have been thinking recently whilst gearing up to go back to work(non essential retail) different sorts of ways in which we can trade, adhering to social distancing rules and keeping staff and customers as safe as we possibly can. Mobile apps seem to be the thing I keep coming back to, I really do think it is gonna be the way forward and here are some of my ideas I have to what may become the new normal. I would love to hear your thoughts and any ideas you have also! 

- There is a non essential retail store you want to visit, they have an app, you can book an allocated time slot, you visit the store in your allocated time slot and pick up all the non essential things you want in a safe way. Even allows for businesses to have a more tailored one on one service with a customer, makes the customers feel special/safe and cared for.

- Restaurants/cafes and also any businesses that want to appeal to passers by. - They have an app you can download and of course takeaway collections and making a reservation have always been a thing but say you are walking past a place and fancy going in they have a screen outside in their window displays with a QR code, you can scan this code and you are given an estimated waiting time, you have shown your interest in going in and are now in a virtual queue, you can go off and wait somewhere else until your phone notifies you that you may come in store as there is space for you and everyone in front of you in the queue has had their turn. 

I just don’t think queues on every high street in every store is ever going to work. Like imagine going to Oxford ST London for a day out I know that seems so far fetched right now but according to the government and all the businesses gearing up its going to happen sooner than we are ready, and there is a queue outside every door, they are soon going to realise that physical queues at every door is not great for anyone. Personally it would put me off going, but say on the other hand I could book an appointment at every store I wanted to visit the day before, great, I would definitely be more trusting of popping down. 

I would really love to hear any of your ideas and thoughts in what aspects of our day to day life  we could see changing to make this new normal a little more better and normal for everyone. Do any of you see any interesting ways in which businesses around you are adapting? 

I’m just so sick of queues lol and can’t help but think some of these massive companies could get a little more creative right now! I wouldn’t be suprised though if this is something a lot of them are already working on! My company doesn’t seem to be doing so :( queues looks like the route they are going down!

 Parcel from Italy I ordered some goods online 2 days ago and the parcel has been delivered this morning, it has come from Reggio Emilia Northern Italy (1 hour from quarantined towns). I didn’t know this when I ordered, I presumed the goods would come from the UK. Interested in thoughts regards keeping the parcel or just sending it back (I haven’t opened it!)

 Home test result wait time? Hi guys.

Has anyone done a home test lately? If so what was your waiting time with regards to results?

I sent a test off Thursday afternoon, it arrived in Glasgow this morning at 8am. Was just wondering if there's any chance I'd hear anything by tomorrow?

Cheers

 Would you respect a Prime Minster who admits failure during a crisis? Many people think that the "Stay Alert" message is a confusing disaster. So I started to think:

"Why can't Boris change his mind? Why can't he say 'screw it, we got it wrong. Stay Home was a much better message'. Let's go back to that. "

Would you be able to get on with an admission like this? Especially *during* a crisis?

I appreciate it's probably 48 hours too late now. And the media would slaughter him. Any thoughts?

 Is social distancing enough? My dad still has to work, he's 69. My dad's job is classed as a key job, so he has to go to work. They have split out their desks and moved people to different offices to reduce the amount of people in work at one time. My issue is, my dad is 69 this year, but they won't allow him to stay home - he's worried if he asks for that to happen they'll force him to retire, which he can't do as my parents rely on that income. 

Is social distancing really enough to protect him?
