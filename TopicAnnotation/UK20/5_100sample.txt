 Moving homes during restrictions Hi, I'm looking for some advice,  me and my girlfriend bought a house about a month ago,  with lots to do , were now getting the final things in place,  our bathroom is currently being fitted (we only have 1 and wanted to get it renovated before we moved in as it was dated) and it should be finished by the end of the week , we are due a security camera to be fitted Wednesday afternoon, a sofa delivery on Thursday,  Friday were supposed to have a bed delivered , Saturday/Sunday we were supposed to be picking up curtains being made by a relative and having a fireplace fitted, and then finally Monday the internet was coming and we were were planning Tuesday Wednesday to move our final things over , and move in . This would allow my partner to then fully isolate , and only I would be going to work,  where as at the moment both sets of our parents are still working .

We have both been in contact with each others families untill today so any mingling of households has already happened as were long term partners who both currently still live with parents (about 5 mins drive from each other) she works from home at the moment and as I'm off work due to taking annual leave, we have already been practicing social distancing and our social contact has been minimal. 

Now we are both stranded in separate houses in a separate town to our new house just as we were about to move in. Will we still be ok to go back and forth to the house (10-15mins drive) with no other contact other than the contractors coming to the house as they will likely be key workers (plumber, electrician, internet provider and a couple of delivery vans), Or are we basically f*****?

 Priority access I hope nobody minds me asking here but I’m not sure what is going on.
I have been sent an email from Iceland.co.uk telling me I’m on the government priority list and they’ve given me access to deliveries, surely everyone who has been identified as vulnerable would’ve been notified a long time before now? 
Has anyone had anything similar recently?

 Please don’t panic buy Happened to go to the shops today to pick up 3/4 tins of tomatoes as part of our normal shop and could barely find any. People are going a bit overboard and it’s hurting those most vulnerable in our society

Was speaking to one of the people working at the local Tesco and she was telling me that stock is ok IF people do normal shopping. When people go overboard then they can’t keep up and it becomes a problem. So please shop responsibly, help those around you who are vulnerable, wash your hands and maintain a clean environment, and just everyone please be safe

 Should I attend my therapy session (SORRY TO BE ANNOYING I ASKED A SIMILAR QUESTION THE OTHER DAY ABOUT COLLEGE) I have OCD and I have a therapy session this Friday but because of the Coronavirus I am super paranoid to attend... I keep thinking of all the people she must see on a daily basis etc and the risks to it. I am considering leaving college too, I haven't been to college this week so far because I have felt ill(and corona worries). I don't know if I'm overreacting because of my OCD, there are no confirmed cases in my area yet (1 in the nearby city where my college is) but I don't trust that. (people must travel and they cant test everyone surely there are people out there they haven't tested who have it) please help!!!! I really want to see my therapist but I don't want to risk it. She works in my town and another town 20 mins away. I could ask for a phone appointment but I want to see her face to face. Am I being overdramatic?

 Quarantine enforcement Since the 14 day quarantine has been in force since June 8th has there actually been ANY reports of it being enforced? I read an article saying no police force contacted had handed out any fines, I can't find any examples of people being sent to government designated hotels for those who don't fill out the forms and I've seen that peiple have been reported for breaking quarantine with no police follow up... Just seems pointless at this point

 Cheltenham festival 250,000 spectators Due to start next week, on top of 250,000 visiting spectators there is a huge festival staff and all the people related to the horses.

A lot of people drinking a lot, crammed into small bar and betting areas, then traveling home on train's and planes.

This is an example of 'too big to fail' . It should be cancelled, it must  be cancelled, but I very much doubt it will be.

 Question about the new mask laws... Hello everyone, I’m not sure if this is the right place to ask this, but I wasn’t sure where else to. 
I work as a cashier in a large grocery store and sometimes part of my job is standing by the door, giving out masks and making sure everyone is wearing theirs properly. I was recently shouted at by a customer who told me that it was illegal for me to ask whether or not he had an exemption. I have never asked anyone what their exemption is, or asked them to prove it, only if they have one or not. 
I did some research into this but it was all relatively convoluted, so I was wondering if anyone could tell me definitively if, legally, I can ask someone whether or not they have an exemption as an employee of the store. 
Thanks!

 Furlough and new car. I'm been furloughed since the 24th March and at present have no info as to when I will return to work.

In Feb. My car was written off by a third party as I was sat at the back of stationary traffic on a motorway he failed to stop and ploughed into the back of me.

I was given a hire car while I waited for his insurance company to pay me out which the did last month but I kept the car as it was my only mode of transport and was unable to purchase another until the lockdown was lifted.

A week before the lockdown started I went and put a deposit a 2nd hand 2016 reg car from a local dealers but was unable to collect it because of the lockdown.

The local dealer are now open and are wanting me to collect the car this week but they have said i need to re sign the finance agreement as they was all cancelled when we went into lockdown.

With the uncertainty atm around work I'm reluctant to commit to the new car but the hire car company also want me to return the hire car.

Am I within my rights to keep the hire car ? 

I know I dont have to commit and re sign the finance agreement but then would I lose my deposit and they would no longer gold the car for me or if they have the deposit would they be obliged to keep it until I'm ready?

 In the face of government inaction - let's start planning for what we can do collectively. As we move closer to an Italy/Wuhan scenario in the UK, what measures can we take now that might make a collective difference? I'm not talking about individual preparation, but things that will support our neighbours and communities. With the evident failure of the government to take any serious steps - we need to think about these things together. So here's my initial list...

&amp;#x200B;

1. **If you can, work from home**. The more we do this the more we're contributing to a reduced spread of the disease. The more we do this, the more we make it normal for our colleagues and others to do the same. The more we do this, the more we pressure our bosses to take steps to better facilitate this option. Obviously not everyone can do this, but those of us who can should.
2. **Don't forget about those on zero hour contracts, service sector jobs, and precarious work.** We need to keep hammering home the point that not everyone can quarantine at home for an indefinite period of time. The government needs to provide support to those without access to sick pay, leave, or unable to carry out their work at home. This is not just an individual issue, those who *must* work will obviously continue to do so even if they are sick - this is a sure fire way of spreading the disease even more rapidly.
3. **Don't be judgemental, haughty or arrogant to those who've just figured out what's going on**. Many of us have seen this coming for a long time, and taken our individual precautions. But we can't blame those who bought the 'it's just the flu' narrative or just didn't bother digging into what's been happening over the past months. Instead, we need to patiently explain and support people. We should expect our friends and colleagues to be scared, confused and angry - let's help them through it.
4. **Find ways to convey the seriousness of the situation.** Again, this is not about scaremongering or badgering people. But we need to find ways to make people realise what's going on and what might happen. Personally, I've felt it most effective to focus on the question of ICU and hospital infrastructure. It's easy to understand and brings home the necessity of immediate action.
5. **Remind people that it's not just about us as individuals - our individual behaviour has a social impact.** Those of us who are young and healthy may be relatively less at risk. But ignoring symptoms or acting as if we'll just get over it puts others at risk. So the next time someone says 80% of people will be fine - ask them, well what about the other 20%?
6. **Put pressure on your boss/university/school to be proactive and not reactive.** If enough voices start hassling them, we can encourage them to take steps that the government isn't willing to do. Point to other schools and workplaces who are taking these actions (we're building a great collection of work notices on this sub). Don't take the 'We're following PHE advice' line as an answer to your concerns. Make this an issue of workplace safety and labour rights.
7. **Get to know your neighbours and make sure you touch base with your relatives and loved ones.** Do you have the phone number of your neighbours? Are there people living alone on your street or in your building, who might be scared or need reassurance in case of lockdown? Let people know that you are there for them and willing to help. Can you set up neighbourhood networks to regularly check in on people who might be elderly or living alone?
8. **Give blood!** It is very likely in the case of a prolonged lockdown where people are frightened to leave their houses that we will see shortages in blood donations. Now is the time to donate.

Anyway - some thoughts, would love to hear any other ideas!
++++++++++
 This photo was taken 2 hours ago. Does anyone know how this panic over toilet rolls started? Is there a genuine risk of shortages or are people just following the herd and being scared by the media and posts like this? 
++++++++++
 Shower thought - Why don't we send home all the kids that can isolate but keep them open for the kids of the core services needed to keep the country running? 
++++++++++
 I created a toilet roll calculator to stop people from hoarding excessive amounts. Do you guys have any ideas on how to improve it and reach more people? 
++++++++++
 Can we just respect other people and be civil regardless of their views? Everyone is having different experiences with Covid. Some people might feel comfortable going out to restaurants and bars, and that's perfectly fine. Some people might feel anxious about using public transport, and that's perfectly fine. 

A lot of people have turned to this sub to voice their anxieties to be met with a barrage of abuse. You might think that someone is being 'neurotic' and 'paranoid', but sometimes they're just genuinely struggling. You might think that they *need* a wake-up call, but it's okay to disagree without calling someone names and insulting their mental and emotional capacity. 

I, for example, am being cautious for a lot of reasons. My parents lost a child at the beginning of the pandemic and I wouldn't want to put them through that grief again. My boyfriend's career is over if he messes up his lungs. I'm not just being careful for myself, there's other people to consider.

I'm not saying that my situation is any better or worse than anyone else's - everyone is going through different things. Just- you know, it doesn't hurt to be kinder.

 Travel advice for Italy - Lombardy and 11 provinces quarantined This is the article of the Guardian saying Lombardy and 11 provinces will likelh be quarantined (Italian papers are giving it for certain):



Just for your information, Lombardy alone has 10.8 million residents, and the other provinces are highly populated as well.

If you have to fly to Milan and Venice before April 3rd I guess everything will be cancelled.

I would expect the FCO to update the gov UK website soon as well.
++++++++++
 If they close restaurants will they allow takeaways? Reading about how all bars and restaurants closed in places like Italy I’m wondering if takeaways are still allowed eg delivered by drivers or for pick-up. It would seem reasonable to still allow this as it would place less pressure on supermarkets and would still allow restaurants to keep operating as a takeaway only business. Would make being stuck at home easier too eg my elderly parents eat a lot of takeaways. What would happen eg with McDonalds - would they shut the whole thing, move to delivery only or still allow people to go into the restaurant to pick up but just not sit down. Does anyone have any knowledge of what is happening in other countries who are already on lock down?

 Ridiculous “Herd immunity” Did Boris think by his balls? Herd immunity means using vaccination to protect public from disease by inject 90% people to get protected, not by expose millions people to death, let alone some diseases can’t be handle by our immunity well. Also, more cases shows coronavirus can get infected even for the recovered patients. 

Ok let’s assume miracle land in UK all of sudden and all citizens get immunity of coronavirus, then all other countries are still vulnerable and they will isolate potential carrier- all British citizens.  

Maybe he should ask their family to expose to coronavirus and get immunised and see how it works, then apply it to all the other families. He is trying to throw UK into an abyss of misery!

 Visiting multiple households with high risk people? My sister (who is heavily pregnant) and her husband have been visiting my parents house (Leeds) a few times during the weekends. They used to stay outside but 2 weeks ago they actually went inside and sat and ate inside. Bear in mind my grandma who is elderly and suffered a stroke end of last year also lives there so is high risk. 

Last weekend she had her husbands parents come round to her house (Derby) and again they came inside. Her husbands dad is high risk as he is diabetic. Her husbands family live in Wellingborough. 

My sister is now saying she is going to my parents house (Leeds) this weekend again, and no doubt i guess they will be going in the house again. 

Is it acceptable to be doing all this? Given she, my grandma and her husbands dad are all high risk? 

I live in London and have not been to see my parents since the start of lockdown (March) as i dont think it is worth the risk to my grandma. She keeps asking if i want to go with them to visit as they can pick me up from London but personally i dont think it is safe. It would mean I would have to be in a car with my pregnant sister then visit my elderly grandma in the house. I would then have to come back to London where I live with my bf and risk infecting him. 

Any advise is greatly appreciated!

 Job hunting amidst Coronavirus I have been really struggling with this decision and have been going to multiple people/ posting in a few places hoping some people could help me!

I am being laid off from my current role (a little while ago... so this is not related to COVID-19) and have spent some time job hunting, I have been fortunate to be offered two jobs, one of the jobs seems more 'recession proof' and is offering quite a substantial payrise however is a slight detour from my current career path (albeit a detour I wished to take down the line anyway, more out of interest than out of career progression), the other job is less 'rich' but is offering me some invaluable experience and more importantly a really good work environment. 

I would normally lean towards continuing on my career path and taking the detour further down the line (there are many good reasons for this but not ones I wish to delve too far into) and my gut feeling is telling me to go in this direction with the feeling that staying on my current path will make me more hire-able in a recession/ in general. However with potentially a recession hitting I am now leaning towards the job with the more stable government funded company, even though it takes me away from my projected career path.

What would people here do? 

I have been very lucky to land two jobs before the economy gets worse but I do not wish to go for the role I am less interested in just for economic safety, but perhaps maybe i should?

 Face Coverings Rules In England, you must wear a face covering by law in the following settings:

public transport

indoor transport hubs (airports, rail and tram stations and terminals, maritime ports and terminals, bus and coach stations and terminals)

shops and supermarkets (places which are open to the public and that wholly or mainly offer goods or services for retail sale or hire)

indoor shopping centres

banks, building societies, and post offices (including credit unions, short-term loan providers, savings clubs and money service businesses)

You are expected to wear a face covering immediately before entering any of these settings and must keep it on until you leave.

You are also strongly encouraged to wear a face covering in other enclosed public spaces where social distancing may be difficult and where you come into contact with people you do not normally meet.

Face coverings are also needed in NHS settings, including hospitals and primary or community care settings, such as GP surgeries. They are advised to be worn in care homes. Individual settings may have their own policies and require you to take other measures.

Where this law does not apply

Face coverings are required to be worn in any shops, including food shops and supermarkets, but are not required in hospitality settings, including restaurants with table service, bars, and pubs. They are also not required in entertainment venues (such as cinemas or casinos), visitor attractions (such as heritage sites or museums), exercise and sports venues (such as gyms).

Where a shop is within another premises which does not require a face covering (such as a museum or other visitor attraction) they are required in the shop only. Check for signage upon entry and exit to know when this is the case.

Scotland
Mandatory face coverings

Retail

A face covering must be worn by all people in a shop, except where an exemption or ‘reasonable excuse,’ as defined in the legislation, applies when the shop is open to the public.

A shop is any indoor establishment which offers goods or services for sale or hire. This includes anywhere that offer some goods for hire, for example if a library offers DVDs or CDs for hire.

This does not include hospitality premises such as cafes, coffee shops, restaurants or pubs. It also excludes money services businesses such as banks and building societies.

The law exempts staff in a shop from wearing a face covering where they are able to maintain 2m physical distancing from members of the public, or perspex screens are in place. However, even where staff maintain 2m physical distancing, and are not legally obliged to wear a face covering, it is strongly recommended that a face covering is worn.

Transport

A face covering must be worn by all passengers and staff or operators in the following settings:

train services including the Glasgow subway

bus services and the Edinburgh tram

taxi and private hire vehicles

bus stations, railway stations (including open air stations) and airports

ferry services (unless the ferry is open to the elements and physical distancing can be achieved, or the vessel is large enough that physical distancing can be achieved)

airline services

Face covering exemptions

Some people are not required to wear a face covering.

These include:

children under 5 years of age

police constables or workers such as paramedics acting in the course of their duty 

staff such as drivers or checkout assistants who are physically separated, by means of, for example, screens, from passengers or customers

shop workers if they maintain a 2 metre distance from customers or members of the public

You may also have a reasonable excuse not to wear a face covering if, for example:

you have a health condition or you are disabled and a face covering would be inappropriate because it would cause difficulty, pain or severe distress or anxiety or because you cannot apply a covering and wear it in the proper manner safely and consistently. Individual discretion should be applied in considering the use of face coverings for other children including, for example, children with breathing difficulties and disabled children who would struggle to wear a face covering

you need to eat or drink

you are taking medication

you are communicating with someone else who relies on lip reading

a relevant person, such as a police officer, asks you to remove your face covering

 Under 60s in ICU. Myth or Fact? Many people keep referencing articles that say "OVER 50% OF THOSE IN ICU IN X ARE UNDER 60".

 Question:Why don't we just mandate that all over 60s and people at risk (immuno-suppressed, etc) isolate? Instead of blanket lockdowns which present a lot of difficulties, it seems like restricting it to the at risk groups would take _huge_ pressure off the NHS, it'd squash the death rate, most people could stay working with manageable risk, schools could stay open, the economy wouldn't tank so fast, the hospitalisation rate for the 'active' folk would be far lower, we'd have more time to put mitigations in place...

It seems like a no brainer, no?

 Can only buy 3 of anything, even as 2 people? Went shopping this morning as my wife and I are self isolating from today due to severe underlying conditions. We do not eat meat, dairy or eggs and my wife is celiac. We live on beans, rice, lentils, vegetables and fruit. I make sure that we only get 3 of anything each, max.

Get to the till. 3 soy milk go through but I can't have my 3 almond because it's 3 items max per transaction. I said there's 2 of us, it's supposed to be per person and we are paying together. Was told no. I said can I pay separately for them as another person/transaction. Was told no. So 3 milk to last 2 people until who knows when. I suppose we will have to make do.

Get to the tinned food. We have between us: 4 coconut milk, 2 broad beans, 2 carrots, 2 mushrooms, 2 peas , 3 chopped tomatoes, 2 lentils and 2 onions (Remember this is what we mostly live off and the dried stuff was OOS). We were told we could only have 3 tinned in total. So not up to 3 of each item but 3 tins in total For a household of 2 people. But we were told this after she scanned 3 coconut milk and would not change them. So as a gluten free plant based household of 2 people we have 3 cans of coconut milk, 3 soy milk, no toilet roll, no soap, no beans, no lentils, no chopped tomatoes, no peas, no food. Then I see photos and videos of people who have cupboards and even rooms full of stockpiled food. People next to us had more than 3 different types of meat and this was allowed? It's insane and not fair.

So, anyone know any coconut milk recipes that can last a few weeks? /s :( 

Sorry needed to rant a little. Old people wearing masks trying to get some food and almost crying at the empty shelves as people push past them, coughing and sneezing getting their essential Easter eggs. I can't even.

Stay safe everyone. Peace and Love.
++++++++++
 We NEED a nationwide lockdown ASAP Things are obviously not improving, I am seeing countries like Italy, Morocco and France all using the Army/Police to patrol streets to keep people safe. It's time we bring this to the UK sooner than later. Sadly I think the Tory mentality of free will and letting people do what they want is going to cause thousands more deaths.

People are simply not listening to precautions, I'm still seeing people out and about in large groups, especially elderly people. All travel outside should be banned unless you are going to essential places of work.
++++++++++
 One positive: some sense of local community has increased. For example, lots more people are contacting a local bookshop (who are now doing deliveries) rather than Amazon for their social distancing reading material. A facebook group has been set up for the local area with lots of people offering to support the elderly and vulnerable. People openly saying they're self isolating have received lots of kind messages.

Any other silver linings near you?
++++++++++
 Another reason why Boris' plan makes no sense Right. 

As per what that fucking twat said yesterday, they are not taking any measures because they want to delay the peak.

And he also said they won't be testing people in self quarantine, they'll only test people in hospitals.

If you only test people in hospitals how can one assess the correct number of infected people, considering there are exponentially more people in self quarantine than hospitals.

Based on this, THE TIMING(most important thing as per what they also said) of moving to the next stage will be 100% off and it will be too late. 

The strategy makes no sense, Boris is mental.

 Is travelling to London safe? Of course, as the capital and most busy part of the UK, the place is bound to be crawling with sickness anyway...

I am from a small rural town in Wales, but due to go to a conference in London this weekend. I don't drive. So this is getting coaches to London, and traveling on the tube and buses all over the place – multiple buses and trains each day... (coach station isn't near location of conference, it's about an hour away; hotel isn't near either, also an hour away from each).

I have only been to London twice in my life and traveling about the place on tubes and buses and both times I got an awful cold by time I returned home...

How safe is it to visit London with this Corona virus? Am I being over the top? I'm biased because I don't like London / cities as it is, so mildly anxious about visiting anyway, but now more so with this Corona virus...

 I perfectly understand What PM said, today. A historic speech as great as those Churchill gave us during WWII I perfectly understand What PM said, today. Here's what he means :

1. We are screwed by this virus. But, PM won't say it to you because we all know by now.
2. But, go out for the economy with your screwed head.
3. But, know that it's not really safe to be out there.
4. But, it's necessary to make you people believe that you can go out because some people don't want to be told to stay home. 
5. But, you gotta stay alert because it's not really safe out there.
6. It's not PM's responsibility if you catch the virus because the rules are set and you have been warned and the goverment is doing its utmost.
7. If you are not sure what you are gonna have to do, wait for PM to appear on TV, again. And listen to him. We must understand cause there's no distraction like football or bingo in our time, now.
8. Anyway, you wanna go out cause it feels like being in a ditch in Dunkirk without proper enforcement.
9. So, let's go out. But, it's still better to stay home and stay alert.

It's so easy to understand, no?

 Unpopular opinion: outcome of today's COBRA meeting is reasonable They have introduced two big changes,  May not seem like much, but I think they are.

Firstly, they are removing the requirements for having travelled to certain places for testing, instead basing it on severity of symptoms.  This makes sense as it accepted that community infection is happening.

Secondly, staying at home for anyone with any symptoms, again, this keeps them out of public when most infectious (I know people can be infectious when asymptomatic but it does seem (like most colds, flu) it is most infectious when symptoms are present.

My concern about the "lockdown" approaches in other countries, is what happens when everyone comes out again?  The virus won't have just gone away.  Let's say Italy gets it under control, re-opens, and then someone from anywhere else in the world rocks up with the virus and it starts all over again.

Mass quarantine will be psychologically damaging, and it certainly should be limited.  We are culturally very different from China and honestly, I think riots would be more likely in the case of such extreme measures. Many people simply will not do as they are told. 

This is an incredibly difficult situation,  flatten and delay the peak is as good a tactic as any.

Look, I am a life long leftie and do not trust the tories as far as I could spit them (pun intended) but I think the approach is reasonable and balanced.  

Waiting to be torn to shreds.....

 Need some help with some understanding. My understanding of the current situation is that china, italy and other countries have shut down cities in the hope to stop the spread. Borris johnson has been advised that this option for the UK could be  ineffective, and cause more harm than good. I have also read that unless people are housebound for a significant period of time, that the spread would not be impacted and would only delay the spread. To some extent that makes sense to me, if people are in lockdown the virus may be slowed drastically but if people remain contagious for a period longer than 7days...its only delaying. Chinas new cases seem to be very low and i feel like its an experiment for the UK, if their cases suddenly go through the roof again...surely our "keep calm and carry on" and herd immunity may prove the best option in the longterm. Am i missing something? Everybody seems incredibly anti borris at the moment, is this course of action really that terrible?

 People are so careless lately that I just don't get it anymore For a while we respected social distancing and we were wearing masks. Now, try going out to any shop or supermarket and people are literally bumping onto you to get through because they cant be bothered waiting for the isle to clear out, people move out and worse of all they get  annoyed, shoving you out of the way as if they are in a rush. Worse than that is when you see random people not wearing any mask or wearing it half way down to their chin. I've seen this in all age groups. I just feel sad for the vulnerable right now.

 Please don’t blame the rise on young people Earlier today I (24 years old) walked through a pub and there was 6-7 men in there 50s/60s around the bar staring at me because I had a mask on. As I went to the bar one of them made a very funny joke asking if any of the others needed a painter. As I ordered a drink at the bar another asked if the rest had heard what I said behind my mask. Im wearing my mask to protect people their age and they treat it like that. 

Makes me fume when old people are using young people as a scapegoat for the rise in cases when they refuse to look after anyone except themselves

 Teenage son was feeling poorly last night, went downhill overnight He’s 18, and attends a local 6th Form College with recently returned Ski trip from Italy. He will be off today, and under the current guidelines can self-isolate for 7 days. No big deal.

My wife and I both work in healthcare. She is a doctor, I’m a manager. Under current guidelines we keep calm and carry on (spreading the virus). She will see patients, I will come into contact with support staff.

I guess in a week we’ll have determined if it is Coronavirus or not, but it really feels like a lot of risk. I understand herd immunity and delaying the spread of the virus, and in general it makes sense. But as it plays out there are going to be instances where people’s lives are put at risk unnecessarily just to get the numbers right.

 Safe to go to gym class? I have been lifting a few years but have an opportunity to do a strength camp for 8 weeks. The goal of the camp is to improve technique and strength over the 8 weeks on the big 3 lifts in a very small group 3-4 people. You get 4 sessions a week with the trainer. 

I think it is a really good opportunity to learn a lot and get my lifting technique really worked on. Just a bit worried about the covid-19 side of it all. Would you guys go to something like this or avoid it at all costs in the current climate?

Have been going to the gym as normal but just a bit worried the trainer will get too enthusiastic and get too close or the other people

 You can now visit some National Trust sites and beaches if you book a parking space in advance I think this is a great move. It gives people a change of scenery whilst also enforcing necessary rules.

We visited Dunwich Heath and the beach there today and it was lovely. Got busier as the day went by but nowhere near packed. Everyone respected each other’s space, kept 6ft apart and abided by the one-out-one-in rule for the loos.

It’s also great because if you get in early (like we did) it’s very quiet and serene.

All in all, don’t feel restricted to your own area (to an extent). If you are sensible and respect others space you can have the privilege of visiting these amazing places.

I think if you are a member parking is free but you only have to pay £5 if not.

 How come people are giving so much of a shit about the protests in London when other protests proved that the disease did not spread that well outside? You know which protests I am referring to

and before you hit me with the "ThEy WeRe AlL WeArInG mAsKs AnD sOcIaLlY DiStaNCing", maybe in some cities (though they didn't socially distance), certainly not everyone in Manchester and other cities.

Long story short, those protests (Despite being more or less nationwide) contributed little (At least officially) to the spread of the virus, so why has everyone gone tits up about this one, which is tiny in comparison?

Either the virus is so dangerous that protests need to be stopped, or it isn't. In a liberal democracy, you cannot get to decide which protests you deem insignificant and shouldn't matter. I find it incredibly hypocritical that the same people who once critiqued people for going outside, suddenly decide that the 'severity' of the issue being protested is a contributing factor in whether the disease spreads.

Either protests spread the disease or they do not. The amount of shit this subreddit gave to people going to beaches, going on more walks then they should have done, hanging arounds in groups, many of whom were not crowded, while being completely silent over other ones. ( scenario certainly was not fully masked), or [this one](

The most annoying thing isn't strictly the hypocrisy, but the goalpost moving. At the beginning, it was 'no protests', and everyone, small groups or massive gatherings, were decried and ridiculed across the subreddit. Then the other protests happened, and then at first it was "Oh but they are wearing masks", some argued that they were socially distancing, but they [certainly weren't]( Then after that came the 'oh but these ones *actually* matter'.

Unsafe gatherings are unsafe gatherings. There is no moral disambiguation. There have been endless numbers of protests that have been cancelled over the coronavirus pandemic, and most of those people were distraught over it, but complied. Either protests are allowed or they are not. So which is it and why?

 I am kind of happy about public transport restrictions, but also worried... So I found out yesterday that my regular bus (the first of two buses that I have to use to get to work) is now following a 50% passenger capacity regime, which means only 7 people will be able to board the bus. I’ve also heard rumours that Arriva buses might be doing the same, at some point, which means that when I get off my first bus and have to catch an Arriva to complete my journey to work, there is the chance that the driver might have to just drive past if they’ve reached the 50% passenger capacity. 

While I’m happy that this hopefully means there’ll be better social distancing measures on the buses (which so many are ignoring), it is also worrying...

Both myself and my mother are key workers (in retail) and have been working throughout the lockdown. At the start, travelling wasn’t that bad because less people were using the buses we have to use. However, with the recent easing of the lockdown measures, more and more people have been using the buses - even if they’re only going one or two stops.

This could mean that key workers, who have no choice but to use public transport to get to their place of work, are basically screwed if they can’t get on their buses. 

I don’t know how many might see this, but I just want to politely ask that in whatever region of the UK you are in, please (I beg you), if you are planning to travel outdoors (to the shops or other), and if it’s possible to walk there, please try not to take up spaces on public transport that key workers might need. 

Also, if you have to use public transport, please don’t travel in massive groups...

After finishing my shift and heading to catch my first bus back home, I was walking towards the bus stop and was shocked to see around 20 or so people (adults and children) waiting for the same bus and they were all together as one big (unnecessary) group that took up the upper level of the bus! That’s a lot of seats/space that might need to be used by other people.

I’m sorry for this being quite a long post. Stay safe everyone!

 UK Plan of Action Explained by Professor Ian Donald I found this Tweet and I understood why the UK is acting the way it has so far and I thought it could be helpful to others as well.

“The govt strategy on Coronavirus is more refined than those used in other countries and potentially very effective. But it is also riskier and based on a number of assumptions. They need to be correct, and the measures they introduce need to work when they are supposed to. This all assumes I'm correct in what I think the govt are doing and why. I could be wrong - and wouldn't be surprised. But it looks to me like...

A UK starting assumption is that a high number of the population will inevitably get infected whatever is done – up to 80%. As you can’t stop it, so it is best to manage it. There are limited health resources so the aim is to manage the flow of the seriously ill to these. 

The Italian model the aims to stop infection. The UKs wants infection BUT of particular categories of people. The aim of the UK is to have as many lower risk people infected as possible. Immune people cannot infect others; the more there are the lower the risk of infection. That's herd immunity. Based on this idea, at the moment the govt wants people to get infected, up until hospitals begin to reach capacity. At that they want to reduce, but not stop infection rate. Ideally they balance it so the numbers entering hospital = the number leaving. That balance is the big risk.

All the time people are being treated, other mildly ill people are recovering and the population grows a higher percent of immune people who can’t infect. They can also return to work and keep things going normally - and go to the pubs. The risk is being able to accurately manage infection flow relative to health case resources. Data on infection rates needs to be accurate, the measures they introduce need to work and at the time they want them to and to the degree they want, or the system is overwhelmed.

Schools: Kids generally won’t get very ill, so the govt can use them as a tool to infect others when you want to increase infection. When you need to slow infection, that tap can be turned off – at that point they close the schools. Politically risky for them to say this.

The same for large scale events - stop them when you want to slow infection rates; turn another tap off. This means schools etc are closed for a shorter period and disruption generally is therefore for a shorter period, AND with a growing immune population. This is sustainable. After a while most of the population is immune, the seriously ill have all received treatment and the country is resistant. The more vulnerable are then less at risk. 

This is the end state the govt is aiming for and could achieve. BUT a key issue during this process is protection of those for whom the virus is fatal. It's not clear the full measures there are to protect those people. It assumes they can measure infection, that their behavioural expectations are met - people do what they think they will.

The Italian (and others) strategy is to stop as much infection as possible - or all infection. This is appealing, but then what? The restrictions are not sustainable for months. So the will need to be relaxed. But that will lead to reemergence of infections. Then rates will then start to climb again. So they will have to reintroduce the restrictions each time infection rates rise. That is not a sustainable model and takes much longer to achieve the goal of a largely immune population with low risk of infection of the vulnerable. As the government tries to achieve equilibrium between hospitalisations and infections, more interventions will appear. It's perhaps why there are at the moment few public information films on staying at home. They are treading a tight path, but possibly a sensible one. This is probably the best strategy, but they should explain it more clearly. It relies on a lot of assumptions, so it would be good to know what they are - especially behavioural. Most encouraging, it's way too clever for BorisJohnson to have had any role in developing.”

 Formula for estimaing how many people are unknown infected in my/your city? So if we're on the left of the bell-curve, we might be able to predict how many people in a city/town are infected and shedding viron but have not been counted as infected yet. "Not counted" means they have no idea, or think they may but haven't had a test yet. Or they are sociopaths.

If we have the known-infected number for a city at a moment in time, can we apply a multipler to say how many there are likely unknown-infected at the same moment?  Say London has a totlal of 100 known (true a few days ago), can we say a **hypothetical** 10x of that means 1000 total known and unknown infected in London: meaning the estimated count for that moment would've been 112 infected per million people. Or 0.1 people infected per thousand people.

I mean the government nudge-department has this factor in a spreadsheet but they're not sharing it. And the factor gets bigger then smaller the more rightwards you move on the bell curve - **but for the love of Queen Boudica can we recreate it with some PhD help ?**

 What is the issue with wearing a mask in selected contexts? I don't see why some people seem to be resistive of wearing a mask in a few specific situations (e.g. on public transport, in shops, in a crammed office)?

It is literally just a mask! 

They are not asking you to go for a run with a mask and suffer due to decreased oxygen intake.

They are not asking you to wear one in your own house

What is it that people fear to be missing out if they wear a mask (of any kind, so there is not even a requirement of which type to buy / to wear)?

If anything I am quite keen to adopt something similar to what Asian countries do even after this pandemic: I realised that I take (well, used to) dirty tubes or trains every single day to get to places and with a mask I can simply reduce the risk of getting any virus... 

Getting colds or the flu is annoying, and if I can avoid it with a simple action like wearing a mask in public transports, why not?

Not judging, quite open to understand what could be the view on this topic.

Completely understand if some people have demonstrable and substantial breathing issues (but these are going to be a very tiny minority, right?) and can be excused, but all the others?

 DIY Hand Sanitiser, WHO Official, 30 quid for 5L **YOU DO THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK**

OK, as you guys are all so nice, and not yet in the 10,000's subbed, here's a recipe from the official WHO site on how to make your own hand sanitizer.  I doubt that there's enough people on here to really push prices up on the basic ingredients just yet - so go for it.

[

This is the guide to use, which tells you how to make it.  You'll need to source the following, most likely from ebay or other similar places to make 5L.  Note these are PURCHASE amounts I recommend, not the actual ratio to mix at, which is in the above document.

1x 5L of Isopropanol / Isopropyl Alchohol.  This is about 15-20 quid for 5L. 

500ml of Vegetable Glycerol / Glycerine.  This is cheap, and freely available from a lot of places, it's one of the main components in Vape Juice.  I'm recommending more than you need, as it has other uses (good for itches, bites, google it!). Prices widely vary depending on how much you buy, 5L is about 20 quid but increases rapidly price/ml in smaller quantities.  If you know a vaper who DIY's his ejuice, they might be able to sort you out for a few quid.

1L of Hydrogen Peroxide 3% (if you get 6%, you use half of the amount). About 7 quid...

Optional - buy some actual small chemistry measuring jubs, a 25 or 50ml one is most useful here. 

You will need to be 'fairly' accurate when mixing this - use the most accurate measuring jug, and optionally weigh quantities too - but be careful that glycerine for example is denser, thus weighs more that 1g per 1ml.

**Here's a recipe to make up 1L**

* **750ml of Isopropanol**
* **20ml Hydrogen Peroxide at 6%**
* **15ml of Glycerine**
* **Top up to 1L with cooled, boiled, water.**

 Do I need a Public Health Passenger Locator Form and when should I do it My parents are traveling and they will need to self-quarantine when they get back.

Some people I know traveled and the apparently needed a for telling the authorities where they will be isolating. I believe its the [Public Health Passenger Locator Form](

Just as the people they know, they want me to fill the forms (they suddenly have bad eyesight apparently) and send the form as image/pdf on their phone.

The websites says "You cannot submit this form until 48 hours before your arrival time in the UK." but as I understand it you do not submit anything you just fill it in and print it (or pdf) and hand it in at the airport.

Does anyone have any idea why it's not been put into Tier 2? Is it because a place has to show a sustained rate of infection before it goes up a Tier? Or because of population density? Is it decided in discussion with the council? I'm lost here.

 Social and Family contact - from the new document &gt;Social and family contact Since 23 March the Government has asked people to only leave the house for very limited purposes and this has been extraordinarily disruptive to people's lives. In particular this has affected the isolated and vulnerable, and those who live alone. As restrictions continue, the Government is considering a range of options to reduce the most harmful social effects to make the measures more sustainable.   
For example, the Government has asked SAGE to examine whether, when and how it can safely change the regulations to allow people to expand their household group to include one other household in the same exclusive group.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;The intention of this change would be to allow those who are isolated some more social contact, and to reduce the most harmful effects of the current social restrictions, while continuing to limit the risk of chains of transmission. It would also support some families to return to work by, for example, allowing two households to share childcare.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;This could be based on the New Zealand model of household "bubbles" where a single "bubble" is the people you live with. As in New Zealand, the rationale behind keeping household groups small is to limit the number of social contacts people have and, in particular, to limit the risk of interhousehold transmissions.  
  
&gt;  
&gt; In addition, the Government is also examining how to enable people to gather in slightly larger groups to better facilitate small weddings.  
  
&gt;  
&gt; Over the coming weeks, the Government will engage on the nature and timing of the measures in this step, in order to consider the widest possible array of views on how best to balance the health, economic and social effects

 Advice on 75-year-old grandparents who won't listen Hey everyone, hope you're all staying safe out there and hope this is okay to post here. \*\*tl;dr\*\* is at the bottom, sorry in advance for the long post

Basically I live in an annex flat next to my 75-year-old grandparents. One of them is getting chemo. It took them a while to convince them how serious this situation is (before that they were still meeting up with friends, doing unnecessary shopping trips, etc.)

They've now agreed to let me take over their shopping (I'm keeping trips to the supermarket to an absolute minimum but getting deliveries is very hard).

There are two things they keep doing though which I think is putting them at risk:

1. This is less serious, but they keep inviting me into their house to have a cup of tea or lunch. I've told them maybe six times now that because I'm still going out to do all our shopping, I could easily be infected and do not want to pass it on to them. I am of course refusing but talking to them on the phone every day.
2. Far more seriously, they keep having friends round in the garden (albeit one at a time and at a distance). We're lucky enough to have a big outside patio and I've been watching from afar. Basically they sit at one table and a friend will sit at a table several metres away (but still close enough to talk).

They're very sociable people and most of their lives in normal times is spent meeting up with friends, so they're finding the lockdown tough. HOWEVER, I've emphasised they shouldn't be having ANY visitors at all, even if they're sitting a few metres away, because what if that friend was ill and sneezed? It could easily reach them. Or what if they sit at the same table later because they forget and pick it up off the table or something?

I'm glad they're not being totally reckless and just having friends inside and sitting close and everything, but as they're about as high risk as can be, I feel they're still putting themselves at huge risk just for the sake of having chats with friends.

I've emphasised they at least have each other (whereas I'm probably not going to see my boyfriend who lives in another town for months because of this), and can use the time to do gardening, read books, catch up on TV etc.

I'm getting to my wits' end trying to stop them having anyone round, even if they are trying to keep a distance, as it seems too risky given what's at stake.

Am I doing the right thing in telling them to stop this? I know there's a risk their mental health could be affected by not seeing anyone for months, but they could have video calls with friends and just entertain each other. Personally I'd love to be cooped up with my BF right now playing video games or whatever but I don't have that luxury.

\*\*tl;dr\*\* Grandparents are having friends round (one at a time) and keeping a distance of several metres in the garden, but am I right in thinking they're still putting themselves at huge risk by doing this?

 People still don't get the message. Working at a supermarket I was checking shelves a man comes up to where I am and proceeds to reach across me! I move out of the way in semi-shock and he follows me still! Honestly this is pathetic from customers not respecting social distancing. It should be a one week ban from supermarkets for breaching this, I keep my distance you keep yours.

Thankfully some customers follow this but those who don't honestly disgust me with their ignorance. Everyone knows what is happening so wake up and follow the rules please.

Otherwise I'd suggest total lockdown. One customer per supermarket. Until we get the message being followed.

There's so many dead-eyed people walking around with their eyes cast down on their mobiles and they rarely ever have individual thoughts and it's just incredibly sad.

I think about people being welded in their houses in China, beaten and killed (even wild and domestic animals) and I look at our spineless country and just think why do people keep buying into this rubbish?

What is it going to take for people in large quantities to wake up, stop paying their bills, stop supporting these evil governments and go back to a more simplistic way of living with micro-communities.

Should have called the police but I saw red instantly as I felt the spit on my leg; instead I turned back and without saying anything reached into my bag threw a (small) bottle of rum at him.

'I can confirm that we don't give any cover if the FCO restricts the customers to travel. However, we don't cover any events or outcomes that are directly or indirectly associated with pandemic diseases like corona virus.'

 Lockdown rules aren’t being followed I’m not sure about other people’s cities, But where I’m from lockdown restrictions are definitely not being followed by the majority of this cities population. 

Me and my husband are both key workers and it’s only me that can drive. So I have to drive him to and from work 5 days a week. When I take him to work in a morning about 8am everything’s fine, barely any cars on the roads. But when I pick him up around 5pm it’s a whole different story. I get stuck in traffic which I doubt all of them cars are key workers. I see groups walking about everywhere and you don’t have to be a police man to be able to tell they are definitely not from the same household. Groups of teens, big groups of people around the same age groups etc. I hear customers at my work chatting about how they aren’t bothered about all this and doing what they want anyway. I see on my Facebook people clearly having people over to their house or going over to other peoples houses. I drove into a rough area today and the traffic was insane.

 It’s honestly like lock down isn’t really going on.

Under normal circumstances I don’t really care what other people do unless it affects me. But it’s so annoying when I haven’t been seeing my family or friends for weeks knowing that so many people are doing just that.  But a complete stranger can get right up close to me at work but I cant go near my family 

What’s other cities like and how’re you handling it?

 Home delivery for the vulnerable Both my grandparents are in the at risk group, they are ordering there shopping online at Tesco/Asda and we have now put a large electric cooler in there lockable porch, along with a large cardboard box. 
The note on the door reads ‘At risk elderly residents, please place chilled food in cooler provided, thank you’. (They are also going to leave a tip for the driver because they are cuties)
My grandparents will then retrieve the food 2 days after the delivery. This will hopefully minimize their risk of contracting the virus. I just thought this might be helpful for others with vulnerable family members who are isolating for safety reasons. Stay safe, look after each other.

So just let it be, we all have a different focus.

The mods are working hard and asking people to post memes and other low quality content in another subreddit that would free up this subreddit but it isn't an exact science.

Of course the political discourse has heated up and some peoples positions are more entrenched as this is an evolving situation; but let's not lose site of the point, this is a place to collate all of the below and then upvote/downvote based on your own preferences or why not add your own erudite comment.

 People taking advantage of the ‘hidden disabilty’ lanyards to avoid wearing a mask? So many people sharing this information on social media to encourage others to ‘stick it to them’ and ‘not give up your freedom’ by wearing a mask.

Can see more and more people using these as time goes on.

 People with underlying health issues or 80+ are at risk... So what are underlying health issues? No-one is saying, but how about:


Diabetes: 4.8 million


Heart disease: 7.4 million


Living with cancer: 2.5 million


Asthma: 5.4 million


80+: 3.2 million



There’s 23.3 million people at risk for starters (ignoring overlaps)
