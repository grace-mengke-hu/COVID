 People with OCD (or not), how are you coping with the hygiene aspect? In my case it's sent me back about 10 years. If I go the shops, I take hand sanitizer, use that every so often, but it's when I get home into overdrive. 

Come home, wash my hands. Take my shoes off, wash hands, antibacterial wipe on my debit card, empty bags, wash hands. Put food away, wash hands. Get changed, put the clothes I was wearing outside in the wash. Wash hands.

Food items I've bought, wash hands after putting them away. 

Parcels that are delivered, wash hands after opening. Wipe down the contents of the package. Wash hands after using front door.

Walk my dog, get home wash my hands. Repeat the above re shoes and clothes. If my dog comes to play with me, or lick me, I wash hands rugby afterwards because he's been outside. 

Basically, I wash my hands a lot, and they're very chapped now. I don't know whether I'm going overboard, or if this is justified in this case?

Other people with OCD, or people without, how exactly are you coping with this?

 Do I have to give 'attention to detail' while disinfecting grocery packages? I saw some videos on YouTube about disinfecting grocery packages. Let's say, I ordered groceries online today in the morning, and they are delivered to my home in the evening (same day). 
Now let's talk about this video: 


Regarding the method of disinfecting the packages (in this video), some users made comments :---

User 'janet welch' commented---

*"Not trying to be smart, but your gloves were ‚Äúcontaminated‚Äù by the outer boxes of the first item.¬† Every item you touched after that was contaminated by those dirty gloves touching them. For instance, you picked up the milk jug with the one hand, wiped most of it with the wipe in the other hand, then changed hands so that the opposite glove grasped the handle which at that point was soiled by the contaminated glove on the first hand.¬† If the gloves themselves are not disinfected after each item and when changing hold of the item from one gloved hand to the other, you are recontaminating the item you just wiped."*

Another user 'sus2731' commented---

*"oh oh, all the items you "desinfected" from 4:48 to 6:29 you wipe them with the clorix but then you keep touching them with your "contaminated" hands, I say "contaminated" bcz you are touching all the "contaminated" items with the same hands, you were supposed to 1, have someone else with "clean" hands to help you hold the items or 2, use 2 wipes, one wipe to put underneath your "contaminated" hand so the dirty hand wont touch the item, and another wipe to wipe the item....ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"*

What are your thoughts about these? Do I have to consider these things (that is said in the comments) while disinfecting grocery packages with alcohol Disinfectant (72% alcohol)?
========
(I have 72% alcohol Disinfectant. But I don't have Disinfectant wipes. I will spray the Disinfectant on tissue, then I will use the tissue to wipe)
(The packages will be delivered on the same day)

 Wash your hands and pubs and clubs should have soap ? 

Is it just me or does anyone else feel like a rat in a lab right now ? On one hand they shut multiple surgeries. On the other hand the best they can do is hold up bits of paper saying wash your hands ?  I can assure you everyone is washing there hands. Mine are squeaky and covered in alcohol gel all day.

 Forget about length of time washing your hands, think POO HANDS I am averagely worried about Coronavirus, but what is annoying me is that no one is talking about HOW to wash your hands, only how long for. 

I have come up with a new solution, it does not involve happy birthday. It‚Äôs called POO HANDS. 

It goes like this. Pretend your hands are covered in poo. You can be creative with this. What ever poo you want - human poo is up there, dog poo, or if you‚Äôre a vegan maybe horse poo. Cow pat could be good for visuals because you can really get those hands stuck in there. 

And then proceed to wash your hands like they are covered in poo. You wouldn‚Äôt casually be washing your hands while singing Happy Birthday to yourself. You‚Äôd really scrub them and get all into the nooks and under nails and get every tiny bit off your hands. You‚Äôd really get that soap on there and work them. Once you are satisfied the imaginary poo is no longer an issue, you can stop. 

For the more easily offended you could perhaps pretend to have bread dough hands or olive oil hands or whatever but I just don‚Äôt think it is as effective. 

If it reassures you to sing while washing your hands, you can still do this. But with this method you can sing what ever you like! You can do the whole of Bohemian Rhapsody if that makes your day better.

Good luck and God speed and remember POO HANDS. 

I have many more tips, so do let me know if you‚Äôd like to hear more.

 Supermarket concerns, same for anyone else? Just come back from the local ASDA and I notice staff have begun tearing down and pulling up the one way signs and arrows from the end shelves and floors. Thankfully the vast majority are wearing their masks, but social distancing no longer exists within the store.

Cases are rapidly increasing as Boris Johnson warns the public about a potential second wave on the horizon, so I'm really hoping shops and supermarkets aren't relaxing the rules at this crucial point in this pandemic.

 In order to kill all the coronavirus particles on my hands, do I have to "dry" my hands after washing with soap and rinsing with water? If I wash my hands for 20 seconds with soap (as shown by WHO) and then rinse with water, do I also have to dry my hand (using tissue or something else)?

If I don't dry my hands, will there be any 'active' Coronavirus? 

In the process of killing/deactivating all the coronavirus on hands, does "drying" have a role?

 Covid Dance Hands (jazz hands), Face (cover face), Space (make a nice wide circle with your hands), Get a test (mimic being swabbed), and self isolate (X-factor style cross arms). 

It's the 90's dance for the 20's.
