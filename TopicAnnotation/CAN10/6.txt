 Website that lists how companies have responded Hi all, 

I saw a comment that had a link to a website that listed how companies have responded so far to Covid-19. I unfortunately can’t find the link again but I want to know what companies to support once this passes! 

Thanks

 Can't touch my face, what do I do if it's itchy? Since we can't touch our faces for risk of infecting ourselves, what do we do? I never realized how often I touch my face. Even right now my beard is itching like crazy!

 Work From Home - Coronavirus Toronto I am a Canadian-Korean citizen. My work has recently requested for their employees to submit if they or someone in their household is visiting outside of Canada (clouding Mexico and US). 

My family (Canadian citizens) are visiting from Busan, Korea. My manager advised me to send in the issue and I received an email from HR asking me to self quarantine myself for 14 days from the date I see them. 

Is this happening anywhere else in Toronto or rest of Canada? I’m interested to see if why it is only family-related ex. A friend visits from China - why isn’t this being reported?

I have my monitor set up so I can work from home for 2 weeks. I wonder if they’ll ask who I have interacted with prior to my return.
