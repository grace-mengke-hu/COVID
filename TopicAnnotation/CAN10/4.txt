 Canada should suspend any religious activity this year I was researching the so-far successful story of Singapore, Korea and China in battling with Coronavirus outbreak.

I found that one of the advantages of Asian countries is that the proportion of religious people remains low. Once social  and commercial activities are suspended, the chance of person-person direct spread is low.

However, religious activities are more active in middle East countries and European countries are high, which makes control more difficult.

I am hoping religious activity can be suspended during the outbreak.
