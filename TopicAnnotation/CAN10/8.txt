[Graph of positive cases] (

Today we had an increase of 135 positive cases, a bit less than yesterdays. While people might assume this might be due to the reduced testing, we actually tested 1.5 times more than yesterday, in fact we tested so much that our cases under investigation actually went down. The first time in weeks. 

On the other hand, all 135 cases today are *pending*, in fact the people updating the table just removed it all together since they didn't want to have to write it out. We've also had 3 more deceased cases, since they weren't on the new cases section (well there isn't one in any case), we can assume is our previous cases.

As we come to Friday the 13th, Ontario increases its positive cases by another 20 cases. But as we look at the numbers of cases being tested, we can see the quantity steadily rising. However, even with the large amounts of tests each day, it is unable to stop the tide of the number of cases under investigation. Continuing to grow each day even with the increase of testing capabilities. An important key to focus on is Ontario's 67th case, a man in his 80s. He has been hospitalized and is now the only case in Ontario to do so. 

Following the closure of public schools yesterday, various universities and colleges in Ontario are closing as well. Examples like the University of Toronto, York University, Seneca College, etc. 

The number of cases today seemed to have overwhelmed even the personnel updating the website as now shortforms are used instead of their original names. ("Peel Public Health" is now just "Peel"). We also have an increase of "pending status" on cases, from the 75th case to the 79th case, we have no information on the case besides the fact that they are in Toronto. This is worrisome as it almost feels like that they're trying to hide the information.

The most drastic thing to happen today is the incredible increase in testing from yesterday and from since the beginning. I've already noted the tripling of cases under investigation in yesterday's post but today's increase dwarfs that. It seems that the criteria for testing is being loosened as Ontario ramps up testing for a larger number of people. 

This ties in to the 6 new positive cases we've had today, with the first one being very key here. Unlike other cases that we've had, this one's cause is unknown. The man in his 50s presented himself to Health Sciences North but he had no travel history nor did he have any close contact with previous confirmed cases. This could be the result of a community transmission, in which the man was infected by another unconfirmed but positive case. However, there is a silver lining in this situation. The fact that they tested this man without his prior contact to confirmed cases or his lack of travel history means that Ontario is no longer strictly testing anymore. With a more widespread testing method, Ontario will be able to better inform themselves of how many actual infected there are. As a result, we could see a large increase of positive cases during the next few days. 

The rest of the cases today all had prior travel history, with the majority of them coming in from the US. 

* The second case today is woman in her 30s with a travel history to Egypt. She presented herself to Mackenzie Health hospital and is now in self-isolation
* The third case today is man in his 30s with a travel history to the US. He presented himself to Toronto Western hospital and is now in self-isolation
* The fourth case today is man in his 40s with a travel history to Austria. He presented himself to Ottawa Hospital and is now in self-isolation
* The fifth case today is woman in her 30s with a travel history to the US. She presented herself to Hamilton Health Sciences and is now in self-isolation
* The sixth case today is woman in her 40s with a travel history to the US. She presented herself to St Josephâ€™s Health Centre and is now in self-isolation

 Canada's "Have Provinces" and "Have not Provinces" of COVID-19 **The "Have Provinces":**

[Nova Scotia]( Active Cases, Hospitalization, ICU admissions slightly off peak. New cases trending up, but flattening. 1.02 in 100,000 hospitalized. Mortality per 100,000 population: 1.23 

[Alberta]( Active Cases, Hospitalization, ICU admissions at peak. New cases trending up steeper than they did in March. 1.59 in 100,000 hospitalized. Mortality per 100,000 population: 1.5

[Ontario]( Active Cases, Hospitalization at peak. New cases trending up after slowing, but shallower than they did in March. 5.97 in 100,000 hospitalized. Mortality per 100,000 population: 4.48 

[Quebec]( Active Cases, Hospitalization at peak. New cases trending up after flattening, but shallower than they did in March. 14.97 in 100,000 hospitalized. Mortality per 100,000 population: 13.28. The situation is by far the worst in Canada.

**The "Have not Provinces":**

[Saskatchewan](  Active Cases, Hospitalization, ICU admissions are all 14 days or more from peak. New cases are flat at just above 3 cases a day. 0.42 in 100,000 hospitalized. Mortality per 100,000 population: 0.34

[Manitoba]( Active Cases, Hospitalization, ICU admissions are all 14 days or more from peak. New cases are flat at just above 1 case a day. 0.51 in 100,000 hospitalized. Mortality per 100,000 population: 0.44

[Newfoundland &amp; Labrador]( Active Cases, Hospitalization, ICU admissions are all 14 days or more from peak. New cases are flat at just above 1 case a day. Had 5 straight days of zero cases. 1.15 in 100,000 hospitalized. Mortality per 100,000 population: 0.58

[New Brunswick]( Active Cases, Hospitalization, ICU admissions are all 14 days or more from peak. New cases are flat and at zero. Had only 1 new case in the last 7 days. 0.64 in 100,000 hospitalized. No deaths. The situation is clearly the best in Canada.

**The odd one out:**

[British Columbia](  Active Cases are back at peak recently after going 14 days off peak. Hospitalization, ICU admissions are all 14 days or more from peak. The 7 days moving average for new cases is flat and off the peak. It is levelled at roughly 33 new cases a day,  comparably higher than the "Have not Provinces" but is not trending up as the "Have Provinces". 2.2 in 100,000 hospitalized. Mortality per 100,000 population: 1.76. Both statistics are higher than some of the "Have Provinces".

First thing we have to talk about is the increased updates that the Ontario website is giving out. Previously the website only updated once during weekdays, now they are updating twice a day every single day. So credit where credit is due, good on Tim for putting in the extra hours to keep us updated. 

The next thing is the addition of the new cases table on the website. Now you can see the information of the new cases like age, gender, location, hospital, transmission type, and status. Really great table to make such information easy to view. Unfortunately this only affects new cases, so it doesn't affect previous cases but if you look through my previous posts, I've given information on each case. 

While the table on the website itself says there's only 30 positive cases, that portion was only updated in this morning, below you'll see the update in the afternoon where we have another positive case. Going up to 31. 

So we first start from [last night] ( where we have the addition of two new positive cases. The first is a woman in her 60s who came back from France. She presented herself to Scarborough Health Network - General Site and is now in self-isolation. The second is a man in his 60s who returned from Washington D.C. and. He presented himself to North York General Hospital and is now in self-isolation. 

Moving on to today, we have four additional cases. However all four seem stable and are all in self-isolation. The first is a man in his 50s who came back from Germany and presented himself to Brampton Civic Hospital. The second is a man in his 80s who came back from Iran and presented himself to North York General Hospital.

The third case is a woman in her 70s who came back from Iran and presented herself to North York General Hospital. The last case is a woman in her 30s who was actually infected through H2H transmission and presented herself to Brampton Civic Hospital. It is unsure who she was infected by as there was no information provided for that.
