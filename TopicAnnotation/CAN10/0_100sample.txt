 It has been PROVEN that masks are INEFFECTIVE against COVID-19. This can be demonstrated by vaping while wearing a surgical, cotton/cloth, sponge or N-95 mask. 



The aerosols produced by an e-cigarette (or “vape”) have a size of approximately 120-165 nanometers. The aerosols in the exhaled vape easily exit the mask VISIBLY between the point of contact of the face and the mask. In some masks, the aerosols even go THROUGH the front of the mask.  Consequently, the viral particles also pass around/through the mask; a COVID-19 viral particle is approximately 60-140 nanometers in diameter, which is even smaller than aerosol particles, on average. It is therefore pointless to wear a mask unless you plan on sneezing/coughing in someone’s face because it only blocks large droplets effectively (but your elbow can do this for you) If you walk down the same aisle as someone else in a grocery store or go anywhere remotely near the place they walked (while both wearing masks and keeping a 2-meter distance), you are still very likely to inhale viral particles as they remain in the air for ~ 3 HOURS. 

Let me know why you think I’m wrong, if you disagree.

 Dr. Horacio Harruda's opinion on homemade masks #maskfor all A journalist brought up the question of masks to Dr. Harruda in the context of #masksforall.  This is a loose translation of what he said.

Can you guarantee that masks for all do not have a benefit?
Do you discourage people from wearing a mask?

* This is an interesting question that is being discussed at the moment

* The context is important. Since we are short of masks, here and elsewhere masks must be put to use where they are most useful.
* Even if we had millions of masks, they should never replace proper hand hygiene.  If you are wearing a mask and touching contaminated objects, but feel protected, this is harmful.
* But this idea is being analyzed at the moment.  This is very new.
Mask can be useful to increase social distancing as people do not know if you are sick or not.
* What will we do when we have millions of masks to give away we will see, but right now we cannot.
* Would a mask made of thick fabric help decrease the spread of droplets.  Potentially yes, but not at the same level as a surgical mask.
* We are going to look into it, but one thing is for certain, this will never replace social distancing.
* Will masks worn in public be a crucial element in the fight against this virus? maybe it can contribute, in various ways both physical and psychological 
* *Then he forgets that the question is about homemade masks and reiterates that they need to be reserved for the front line medical staff.  The journalist reminds him that the question is about homemade masks that would decrease transmission of droplets.*
* If someone wants to make homemade masks, he sees no issues with it, if that makes them feel more protected.  As long as that person remembers to practice perfect hand hygiene and keep up the other measures which he considers more important than masks.

 Coronavirus: Air travellers required to wear non-medical masks under new rules 
++++++++++
 Why are are we getting mixed messages about wearing masks? Reading articles from all over the world, a lot of experts are saying wear masks, yet others tell us not to.  So do I wear one or not?  By the way, I have exactly one mask in the house, a drywall dust mask.
++++++++++
 False Rumors Part 1: "Masks Don't Work" There have been lots of misinformation as to whether or not you should wear a mask.

So, to protect ourselves and others, should we wear a mask?

My answer is, yes, you should most definitely wear a mask.

Dr. Perencevich said, “There’s no evidence that wearing masks on healthy people will protect them.”

If your only reason for the fact that the masks don’t do anything is that there is no evidence that they will protect you from the virus, what kind of argument is that? 

Also, this statement is actually incorrect. Of course, masks won't guarantee that you won't get the virus, but there is lots of evidence that they help to some extent. Like the flu, Coronavirus sometimes spreads through the air. Masks help reduce that. Coronavirus mostly spreads through droplets, though, from when people speak, for instance. This is one reason that people have said about masks not working, but that’s the *entire point* of wearing a mask! Masks can block some of that out!

Dr. Perencevich also claimed that wearing a face mask could increase the chance of infection because you're touching your face more often. Educate yourself! Don’t avoid something that does more good than bad just because you don’t know how to use it, especially when you can easily find a tutorial online that shows you and gives you advice.

Even if you still don’t agree with a single thing I say, you should still let other people do what they want. If someone else wants to wear a mask, leave them alone. In fact, they might even be wearing it to protect you!

The doctor also stated, “The one time you would want a mask is if you’re sick and you have to leave the house. If you have the flu or think you have COVID, that’s when you’d put on a mask to protect others. In your house, if you feel like you’re sick, you should wear a mask to protect your family members.”

I completely agree! Do wear a mask if you are or feel sick. *Please* do. My only problem with this is that the symptoms of COVID 19 only start appearing around 14 days after, and spreading of the virus before symptoms show *happens.* It's not necessarily that common, but there have been a couple of cases caused by asymptomatic community spread. This means that you wouldn’t know if you’re sick.

Besides, other people who already know that they're sick wouldn't want to wear a mask if everyone is going to stare at them and say, "You know, masks don't do anything, right?"

I still kept my distance as much as I could. I was at an outdoor market in Montreal, so of course I was around people for about 20 minutes. How badly did I screw up? What are my chances of getting covid, or passing it on (I don't have any symptoms but we can never be 100% sure of course)?  
I am a bit panicked now as I have always been careful with my mask wearing and hardly ever go into public spaces.

 Can we reconsider the dialogue on wearing valved masks? The argument is that the valved mask doesn't do enough to protect others around you. The highest quality safest masks though tend to be the valved ones, they do a great job at protecting you but in the interest of breathing comfortably there is a way to expend the air when you exhale. They are overwhelmingly better at protecting you though, and as this is primarily an airborne virus, they are basically the best and easiest ways to protect yourself.

Let's say that  
`p` is the chance of you getting infected  
`q` is the chance if you infecting others  
`r` is the chance of you not knowing you are sick  
`y` is the severity of the damage you cause by infecting others in situations where you would wear a mask  
`z` is the severity of the damage you would cause infecting others regardless of typical mask use, such as passing it on to family and housemates because you don't wear a mask at home  

The damage you cause then, is something like:  
`p*r*(q*y + z)`

With a non-valved mask, q is reduced compared to with a valved mask. The thing is though, that only applies when you are sick and don't know it, so most of the time that you are wearing a surgical mask you are only signalling that you aren't spreading it 'in the event that you are sick'. Non-valved masks reduce q a reasonable amount, but valved masks reduce p a very significant amount, possibly by an order of magnitude.

With a typical valved mask, p is a very very small number. It brings chances of you getting sick in the first place so low, that it minimizes any sort of damage you could cause from getting sick. It's not a question of "my mask is there to protect you, your mask is there to protect me", it's a matter of practically eliminating the chance of you getting sick from that sort of interaction. Since the chances of you getting sick are so much lower, you are still doing more good than the 'harm reduction' you are doing by wearing a surgical mask to signal that others are safe from you.

Does that make sense? I think that the best masks out there happen to be valved masks, so we shouldn't tell people not to wear the valved ones, they're the absolute best at protecting you, and therefore the best at protecting others by extension of you not getting sick in the first place. The net effect seems overwhelmingly better.

 Hospital: "Remove your mask or do not enter." As of April 6th, hospitals in Alberta, Canada **refuse entry unless you remove your own mask.** They will supply a basic surgical mask, which offers less protection than an N95. There are no exceptions if your are elderly, high risk, a healthcare worker, wear their mask on top of yours, or bring a new mask in the package and open it in hospital. It's their mask or no mask.

The fallowing was sent to me from a hospital supervisor, copy/pasted from an alleged memo by the senior practice lead and physician of infection prevention and control in the Calgary zone.

&gt;With regards to individuals at triage screening:  
&gt;  
&gt;o **If they screen ILI positive**: they should be asked to clean their hands and given a new mask and asked to wear it unless instructed by a healthcare provider to remove it during their stay. They should be asked to remove their gloves and clean their hands.  
&gt;  
&gt;o **If they screen ILI negative:** but want to wear the mask/gloves out of concern from what they have seen on the media, they should be  asked to remove their home mask, and  gloves and clean their hands and give them a hospital mask, to wear for their stay, and they should not wear gloves but clean their hands when entering and exiting the hospital/ unit if they are coming to visit an existing patient.  
&gt;  
&gt;o **If a member of the public comes in wearing a cloth mask, respirator, other mask ppe device, or even a hospital grade mask:** they should be asked to remove their mask and clean their hands and be given a hospital grade mask to wear in place of their own mask while in the facility.  
&gt;  
&gt;o **If any member of the public or staff comes in wearing gloves:** they should be asked to remove their gloves and clean their hands. They should be asked to not wear gloves while in the facility, the only exception may be in instances where the individual has draining wounds or other challenges when they cannot cover their hands with a dressing or where they cannot contain the drainage, then gloves may be valuable in assisting in containing drainage.

Is this right, or is this putting more healthcare workers and vulnerable people at higher risk?

 We are now 6 months into this pandemic. How and why is proper PPE (masks that provide actual filtration) not in the hands of every citizen ? I appreciate cloth masks are better than nothing and do not discourage their use whatsoever - I’m probably the biggest masking advocate out their from all the way since February. I likely  one of the first non-asian people in Ontario voluntarily wearing one in public before covid was declared a pandemic. 

My concern is we have taken a band aid approach to masking (cloth masks, bandanas, ect) and let them become the norm. This is especially concerning with workplace and schools reopening. 

In Korea / China for example, the gen pop mostly wore N95 / KN94 / Kn95 from the onset of the pandemic. They clearly help. Look at the recent Starbucks outbreak in Korea where none of the staff wearing Kn rated masks contracted the virus, while 56 restaurant patrons all unmasked did. 

At mask with particulate filtration qualities costs less than $1 pre pandemic. They only cost about $2 now with inflated pricing. 

We are handing out $2000 / month for people to sit at home, huge wage subsidies, ect. Not denying these measures are necessary, but how can we not provide each citizen a couple of proper masks to wear in public settings ? Masks that are effective to the wearer, as well as those around them. 

I feel like I’m howling at the moon in my own thoughts about this. It’s so simple, yet never surfaces. It was one thing when we weren’t prepared in March, but it’s been 6 months. If we wanted to stockpile, and have adequate supply, we could have / still can? 

It seems like the best bang for your buck option to slow this thing down and reopen effectively (apart from massless settings like indoor gyms and restaurants which contradict science head on and are a pure health gamble for the sake of $$...but that’s another conversation altogether).

 Everyone, let's make and wear homemade masks. Hear me out. This works. There is evidence that wearing masks stops or at least reduces transmission both from infected people and helps stop people from being infected.

Obviously an infinite number of N95 masks would be ideal, but ANY MASK made of suitable material is better than nothing. 

There are many online tutorials showing what works for homemade masks. It's better than nothing.

If everyone wore them, EVERYONE, in public, it would reduce the spread by asymptomatic carriers, and make everyone safer. 

Why doesn't if have to be perfect? If a mask on an asymptomatic carrier is 80% effective, and the mask on the potential newly infected person is 80% effective it virtually ensures the transmission will not take place. 

This is being done in the Czech Republic they went to 100% adherence of wearing face masks and it really seems to be working.

To me this is our best chance of flattening the curve. But if people agree we need not just government directive social media influencers and famous athletes and actors and famous people to make it cool and we can change this.

 Why is there so much mask stigma in Canada? Even in healthcare we are still discouraging patients wearing masks when they come in. Why? I am a nurse at a clinic that needs to remain open. We are not treating COVID19 patients but we might eventually encounter them. We are also screening anyone that comes in and if they have symptoms they are identified and given a mask. But many patients are coming in with no symptoms and are wearing a mask from home to protect themselves. Higher ups and coworkers are continuing to scoff at patients wearing masks when they come in (just the assymptomatic ones) These patients have no symptoms but just want to protect themselves. The original argument was they do not wear them properly and take them on and off without washing hands and touch things etc. The other argument was it can’t be good for them breathing in their own breath? It might make them sick? Is there any evidence for this? I feel like I’m the only one at work that thinks wearing a mask is a good idea. We should be educating patients on how to properly wear a mask in my opinion. And we should all be wearing them. Staff and patients. But I feel like I can’t even bring up the argument because everyone else seems to think the opposite. What should I do? Are they right?

 Wear masks if you can when you go out The biggest issue with this virus is asymptomatic transmission. People that don't know they are infected spread the virus around. This happen even if you only go to grocery store. If everyone wore masks(N95 preferably) , it would stop asymptomatic people from infecting others, and it would stop people from getting infected. If you have a mask, even surgical, please use it. It is as effective, if not more effective than giving the mask to only health care practitioners because it directly helps stop and slow down the spread.

 HK Mask | Homemade mask with replaceable filter for reuse. Hello/Bonjour fellow Canadians,

I know that it's not the norm for people in NA to wear a mask if they feel like they are not sick, but this virus could be asymptomatic meaning you could be spreading the virus without having any common symptoms. However, for people who want to wear them, I think it's close to impossible to find them in your local pharmacy and Hong Kong people had the same difficulty and a Hong Kong chemist, [Dr. Kwong]( has developed a homemade mask called HK Mask (only needs basic sewing skills, newbies can make 1 in 3 hrs) that can use kitchen paper(s) as a filter and still reach an acceptable particle filtration efficiency (up to 91% @ 0.3um particle with 2 kitchen tissues). 

Notes:  
1) The mask needs to be sanitized by iron it every day. 

2) You are supposed to replace the filter (and the mask if possible) every 4 hours because of moisture from your breaths.

 Canada Post stopping home package delivery I haven't heard anything official, but a tracked package was en route to my home today and without a delivery attempt was directed to my nearby post office.

I called Canada Post and was told via their toll free customer service that "packages for home delivery that cannot be left outside unattended are being directed to post offices".

I then called the post office location where my package was supposed to have arrived + ready for pick up 3 hours before. Not only did they not have any idea package deliveries had stopped, but they couldn't find my package either.

So seems the left hand doesn't know what the right is doing, packages are getting re-routed/lost mid-delivery and likely we'll see mail interruptions soon too.

 What to do if a family member test positive for COVID? Hello, 

Last Saturday (the 17th), my family and I (5 of us) got tested for COVID. 3 out of 5 family members were in contact with an individual who tested positive for COVID. At the testing centre, there was a doctor present. The doctor advised 3 of my family members get tested again 4-5 days after the first test, as the 3 of them were in close contact. Whereas, the other 2 do not have to get tested again. At home, everyone self-isolated at their rooms, and wore mask when in shared space; such as the kitchen. On Monday (the 19th), all 5 results came back negative. As advised by the doctor, 3 of the family members who was in close contact with an individual positive for COVID get tested again. 3 of them were tested on Wednesday (the 21st). 2 out of the 3 family members got their result back on Friday (the 23rd), and the results are negative. However, 1 of the 3 family members is still awaiting for their result. Only that 1 member is showing very mild symptoms of aching body but body temperature is average. The rest of the family are not showing symptoms. The family has self-isolated for a week now. However, we will continue to wear mask around the house for extra pre-caution. 

I guess my questions are: 

\- All 3 of them got tested as the same time, how come 1 is not available yet? Kind of weird that 2 got theirs back at the same time but 1 did not, when they got tested as a group. Also, when all 5 of us got tested, all of our results were available at the same time. 

\- If that individual does test positive for COVID, what should the rest of the family do? Do we continue to self-isolate as someone in the household is positive? Or are we allowed to go back to work? Of course, that individual will continue to self-isolate in a room alone and will not have contact with the rest (4) family members. 

To summarize: 

2 family members did not have direct contact with the individual who tested positive for COVID and both tested negative for COVID. The other 2 family members who had direct contact with an individual who tested positive for COVID got tested twice (each) and both of their test results are negative for COVID. 

Any tips, advice or suggestions is greatly appreciated!

 Opinion on wearing a mask? Hi all, as we all heard on the news with Dr. Bonnie Henry and the WHO, they have done a 180 on wearing a cloth mask. From No, to it doesn't hurt but does nothing, to well maybe, to now we recommend you wear a cloth mask to protect others around you. Many people will say this was common sense from the beginning.

Still though I still see most people not wearing one at the grocery stores here in the Metro Vancouver area. I see both sides on this one.

Firstly i'ts useful if and only if you wash your hand and face, them put it on properly, don't touch the mask as you wear it, later wash your hands, take it off, then wash your hands / face again.

Ok so obviously most people don't do all of this because it's tough and we've all seen people put their mask on their chin and even on top of their head / hair while they eat / drink. Then put it back on at that point it seem more just for show to wear a mask if you don't want to be seen not wearing one.

On the other hand the mask isn't to protect yourself but for others around you so even worst case if you dirty your own mask and still wear it the point is every breath you exhale, cough or sneeze, it's there to block it. So maybe it's still worth it in that sense?

Guys let me know what you think. Countries like Taiwan and China wear masks all the time and they say that was part of how they beat it and you have to think they are not all able to wash up before and after taking it off and not touch the mask so maybe either way it does work?

Edit: For those asking if I wear a mask.  Yes I do when I'm out for grocery shopping. I don't when I'm jogging alone in a nearby park. I don't go out for any other reasons. With that said I'm just looking for other people's thoughts on the subject and not really whether their opinion is different from my situation. After all I see people who wear a mask all the time and others who never do. Maybe each side knows something I don't so I'd like to hear from both. Thanks.

 My take on why the public should wear masks. 1. Because masks protects against the corronavirus, otherwise why would health workers would wear them?
2. We are told that if the public wears mask they might have greater chance to infect themselves due to manipulation. I don't know about you, but if there is virus on my mask and i risk infecting myself while touching my mask, its because if i didn't have a mask i would have the virus in that same area around my mouth, in which case it is quite obviously worst. Instead why don't they teach the public how to safely use a mask?
3. The only valid reason we are told not to wear mask is because there is not enough masks for our medical workers. I believe this to be true, but then if that is the case, why don't your government pass a law to make mask selling to the public illegal and at the same time force theses sellers to sell all their stock to the government? By now, mask rationing is already in place in healthcare facilities, and if the government had the intention of really fixing the problem by buying all publicly available mask, they would have done so already. They would have built up a team of buyers to scour shops and internet to get all theses mask. So basically any mask you do not buy to protect yourself is simply a lost mask, a public protection lost.
4. Mask might seems unuseful if we all self isolate, but the truth is that it is yet a soft lockdown, people are still going at the very least to grocery store and pharmacies, and these are infection vectors. Our usage of mask at this moment should be very low as it is required only if someone goes out for theses reasons. Also if you have an infected member of your family at home you'd better have some mask pre-available, because you sure wouldn't want to infect other family members and at the same time bring the number of infected vectors up.
5. It is true that in a perfect world only infected peoples would wear masks, but do you live in a perfect world? I don't. The problem with that theory is that infected persons do not show symptoms right away and it ca take up to 14 days for symptoms to show up, in which case that person is an infection vector until then. And the moment they do realize or not that they are infected, you have to trust that person judgement and capacity to avoid contact with others, easier said than done. Some infected people will still need to get out for food and medicines, or even their family members which again could have become infected unknowingly. And again, the infected person will need masks, where will they get it if they haven't bought it already? The health care system will give them? But aren't they already low on stocks? Which bring us back to buying the stock the healthcare does not have hold of, the one in store or online that our needing government have not taken measure to get a hold of.

Until our government show its intention to buy all theses publicly available stock, and god knows they had the time to do so, i suggest everyone should have a few available masks, and not stockpile them, think of others, mask sitting in your home unused is a waist. Do not be let down by the stigma imposed on us that, if you wear a mask, you must then be infected. At the same time see the positive effect of this current stigma, if you wear a mask, at least you have good chances that strangers will keep physically distant.

Regarding mask usage, make your research on what are the medical guideline for their safe usages and manipulations.

According to some study the use of homemade mask is better than no mask at all, we are talking of possibly 60% effective compared with 95% effective for N95 types. Do not take my word for granted do your own research.   


Personally i am contemplating reusing my few mask by doing a rotation, where i use mask #1 and once done put it out in a dry sunny place for a period of 10 days so that UV rays can cure them, then go to mask #2 and so on. But don't follow my advice, do your research!  


Also, UVC lights and microwaves could be field of research on how to reuse masks. There is limited information out there, but it really worth exploring.

Get informed, many countries which use mask happens to have a better control over the infection rates, but that could be due to other factors, but using common sense i am pretty sure it help them to some degree, although in itself it cannot be THE only strategy.

First and foremost practice physical distancing, but when you have no choice to go out for essential needs, protect yourself and others by any means.

 Why do people hate the mask so damn much? Why do people hate on wearing a mask so much? I mean, I know that masks are supposedly not all that useful. But i feel like it's better than nothing. We also don't know all that much about the virus so maybe it does help a little bit. Do you think maybe we were told the mask is useless to stop people from panicking during this mask shortage?

And why do people hate and judge others who decide to wear a mask? So what if the mask is completely useless, if it gives people wearing it a sense of security, what's the matter? Why do people judge and stare? Like, let people do whatever the fuxk they want.

 Why is ON doing so few tests? Looking at the stats, ON is doing far less tests per capita than most other provinces. Why?

 They’re talking about needing to wear non-medical face masks for when we go back to school. So does that mean we can’t wear the single use blue ones you get in a pack of like 50 because they don’t qualify as “non-medical”? So only reusable cloth face masks are allowed? If this is the case then why? Aren’t the medical ones more effective? Why are we asked to wear the non-medical ones?

 Looking at NBA test results so far, asymptomatic spread is possible There has been many conflicting and confusing phrasing to the question on whether asymptomatic spread is possible. 

On CBC, Dr. Aylward said patients start to shed the virus right before showing symptom, which can be the day of or the day before, but not much before that.

It just so happens we have publicized tests going on in the NBA with teams that played against the Utah Jazz, after Rudy Gobert was diagnosed with COVID-19. 

Here is the timeline of the games played by Jazz, Gobert played in the March 6, 7 and 9 games.

Mar 6, against Boston - news confirming that an elementary school student who got an autograph from Gobert has been confirmed positive. [source](

Mar 7, against Detroit - Detroit player, Christian Wood has just been tested positive. He is said to be asymptomatic still, even after testing positive [source](

Mar 9, against Toronto - all members have tested negative so far

Mar 11, against Oklahoma - first time news came out that Gobert is sick and will not play (he didn't even go to the arena). He was tested some time in the morning and just before the game was set to start, the team doctor stopped the game, telling the referees that he tested positive, around 7pm. His teammate, Donovan Mitchell was tested the same evening and have been confirmed to be positive 

It may be possible that all these are coincidences but it is also likely that Gobert may have been asymptomatic but contagious as early as March 6.

Has anyone else been paying attention to this space?

 New mask restrictions The new restrictions say that in workplaces if you are able to maintain a 2 meter distance you don't have to wear a mask. 

If you are not able to maintain 2 meters and have to be next to someone closer than two meters are masks required? Employees are not within two meters 24/7, but it happens often. 

I wear a mask. I'm under the impression that maintain means.. well maintain... So if you go within two meters you are not maintaining it.

 COVID Alert app question Hi! 

I’ve been really cautious regarding COVID. I have a very small bubble, I always wear a mask in public, and I don’t go out unless it’s necessary. 

My question is whether you get a COVID alert as soon as you’re in contact with someone who tested positive, or whether your phone tracks who you’ve been around, then when they report their test results, you get a notification.


Some backstory: I have the COVID alert app, and I just got a notification that I’ve been exposed in the past 14 days. I tested negative for covid on Tuesday (it’s now friday), and I’m just wondering how worried I should be about this notification. Is it possible this exposure was before my test? The only possible symptom I have is a dry cough, but I’ve had it for a while and it’s actually getting better. Since my test, I had a surgery but wore a surgical mask the whole time, and everyone around me wore a mask as well. 

I absolutely plan to get tested, it might just be a matter of time before I am able to. 

Any experience/wisdom on this? Thanks!

 Theresa Tam has finally admitted masks are useful, even home made It's a small admission, but she had admitted that properly made homemade masks are useful for cutting down on the transmission of the virus.  I hope this is an opening to the idea that everyone should wear homemade masks to cut down on the transmission of the virus.  I think this will become especially important once we are released from this lockdown and avoid creating new hot spots.

 Could a K.Kwong design dyi face mask with a surgical mask filter be a temp solution for healthcare workers? Kenneth Kwong is a HK chemist who has designed a cloth face mask that when used with regular paper towels has up to a N85 rating. 

I am posing a question whether his face mask if used with a surgical mask and face guard could be a temporary solution for healthcare workers when there is a shortage of N95 mask

Not saying this is ideal but better than just having a surgical mask.  Just to re-iterate this post is a question not a statement

 For those who went to Patio's, what safety regulations did you follow? Might go to my local restaurants' patio tomorrow. There has been only 1 case in my area within the last 21 days, and the restaurant I am thinking of heading to is right on the cusp of a neighborhood that hasn't had cases in the last three weeks, so I am thinking ok, its probably safe to go to a patio. For those who went to patios what safety precautions did you take?

 For safety precautions I was thinking this:

1)  Wear a face shield, goggles, KN95 mask with a TrioMed face mask over. I have the triomed face mask which kills 99.99% of Covid as tested by UOFT

2)  Use Gloves, and bring Lysol Wipes along with alcohol swipes

3)  When giving order and when server brings food, step away and keep 6 ft distance

4) Eat with the face shield on

5) Replace mask after eating, and maybe wear a KN95 on my nose to block particles, but outside is pretty safe no?

 Mask-sewing - request and recipe to do  [ 

In Toronto, there's a request for masks and instructions to help guide people who can sew. We're being told by Christine Elliot in Ontario that there is 'adequate supply' while workers are having to ration masks to 2 per shift (first hand info from a relative).

Sharing this both for the sake of the facility asking for them, but also in case any of us/you can help make masks. If it becomes recommended in the coming weeks/months it would be good to know viable ways to make some.

Stay safe folks!

 If everyone wears facemasks, that would help right? Since face masks prevent you from spreading germs to other people, then if everyone wore a face mask (even if asymptomatic) we wouldn't have as many issues with spreading the disease right?

So why doesn't everyone wear one even if it's just made out of cloth? I'm so mad that the government was like we shouldn't wear them and stuff.
