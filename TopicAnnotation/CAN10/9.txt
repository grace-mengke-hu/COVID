 Nova Scotia's current number of cases drops for the first time [

To date, **19,032 test results have been reported** in Nova Scotia, or 1.95% of the entire population, or about 1 out of every 50 people. Today marks the first day our current cases went down. 

Out of those tests:

* **18,453** results were **negative** (97% of all tests) and **579** results were positive (3% of all results)
* There are **400** **current cases** (2.1% of all tests), **389** of which are being treated at home
* **11** are currently **hospitalized** across the province (2.75% of all current positive cases)
   * The number of hospitalizations has been stable for the last 12 days despite the number of tests and cases dramatically increasing, ranging from 9-11 admissions,  with no more than 5 cases admitted to ICU units on a given date.
* **176** have **recovered** (30.4% of all positive tests)
* **3** people have **died**: a woman in her 70s and a woman in her 90s, both from Cape Breton and both with underlying medical conditions, and a man in his 80s from HRM.
* Since our state of emergency was declared, an average of **2.8% of all daily tests** performed have come back **positive**

It is *incredible* to see the change in numbers from my update from the start of the month: [

 Help understanding this data please [Ontario] May 20, 3622 cases 991 hospitalized, 7382 tests completed

Nov 20, today, 12623 cases, 518 hospitalizations, 48173 tests completed.



more tests equals more cases but more cases doesnt equal more hospitalizations? that doesnt make sense?

also interesting to note in footnotes:

7] Back to paragraph^ Deaths are determined by using the outcome field in iPHIS, CORES, CCMtool or The COD. Any case marked "Fatal" is included in the deaths data. Deaths are included whether or not COVID-19 was determined to be a contributing or underlying cause of death as indicated in the iPHIS field “Type of Death”.

[8] Total number of tests completed by the COVID-19 Clinical Lab network (including PHO, hospital and community laboratories). This number represents total tests and not persons tested.
