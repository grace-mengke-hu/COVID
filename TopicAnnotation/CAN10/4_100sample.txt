 Canadian Pandemic Influenza Preparedness: Planning Guidance for the Health Sector There has been significant discussion surrounding Canada's Pandemic planning, preparedness and standards.  For reference, this is Canada's current [Pandemic Influenza Preparedness: Planning Guidance for the Health Sector.](

It was developed in 2006 after the SARS inquiry and updated after MERS and H1N1.

These are detailed steps, measures and contingencies for Federal, Provincial and Municipal governments and public health authorities. 

For the most part, Canada is not following this Pandemic Plan because the Federal Government has not declared an emergency.   [Step 1 of this plan was never taken.](

*Planning for a prolonged and widespread health emergency of  unpredictable impact is challenging but essential. It requires a “whole  of society” response and the coordinated efforts of all levels of  government in collaboration with their stakeholders.*  

Many of us are struggling to understand why Canada finds itself facing new restrictions and wanting to know there is light at the end of the tunnel.  If you want to know why a measures is mandatory or optional, or what options exist for reopening, this is the gold standard.
