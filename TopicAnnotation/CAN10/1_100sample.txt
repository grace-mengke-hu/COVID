 ICU Bed/Ventilator Capacity - Ontario I see a lot of great US-based data on how many, or percentage used ICU/Ventilators. [here]( for example, Florida is at capacity.

What I don't  see a lot of is information on how many/% used ICU beds and ventilators that we have here in Canada or specifically Ontario.  There were a lot of press releases about it [last April]( with numbers that may or may not end up to be correct nor which hospitals.

Does anyone have a good source of information on installed base of ICUs/Ventilators in Ontario and % used?

 Is there any information regarding cases out of the 80+ group and health care workers? I think we are all interested to know a bit more about the source of the infection of those outside the LTC homes and health workers. Defining it as community acquired is definitely not helping much. Many are also direct contact because of positive family members or co-workers. Is there any way to find out more about the source of the transmission? Wouldn’t it help knowing more about the source - if they do contact tracing - to improve the way we all behave?

 Gearing up to restart: Businesses’ need for personal protective equipment / Préparatifs pour la reprise : les besoins des entreprises en matière d’équipement de protection individuelle *\[We are Canada’s national statistical agency. We are here to engage with Canadians and provide them with high-quality statistical information that matters!\]*

Using data collected from the Personal Protective Equipment Survey in July 2020, our new [study]( and [infographic](//www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/11-627-m/11-627-m2020061-eng.htm?utm_source=reddit2&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=statcan_ppd_2020) examine businesses’ demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) and concerns about lack of supply. 

Here are some highlights:

· As of July, a little over two-thirds (69.1%) of businesses operating in the provinces need, or expect to need, PPE to operate in accordance with COVID-19-related public health guidance.

· At least four out of five businesses in accommodation and food services, health care and social assistance, retail trade, and construction require PPE. 

· Of the businesses that need PPE, two-thirds (67.3%) need at least 4 of the 12 types of PPE covered by the Personal Protective Equipment Survey.

À l’aide de données recueillies dans le cadre de l’Enquête sur l’équipement de protection individuelle de juillet 2020, notre nouvel [article]( et notre nouvelle [infographie]( examinent la demande d’équipement de protection individuelle (EPI) des entreprises et leurs préoccupations quant à leur disponibilité.

Voici quelques faits saillants :

· En juillet, un peu plus des deux tiers (69,1 %) des entreprises en exploitation dans les provinces canadiennes avaient besoin ou prévoyaient avoir besoin d’EPI pour exercer leurs activités en respectant les directives des autorités sanitaires liées à la COVID-19.

· Au moins 4 entreprises sur 5 dans les secteurs des services d’hébergement et de restauration, des soins de santé et de l’assistance sociale, du commerce de détail et de la construction ont indiqué avoir besoin d’EPI.

· Parmi les entreprises ayant besoin d’EPI, les deux tiers (67,3 %) ont déclaré avoir besoin d’au moins 4 des 12 types d’EPI mentionnés dans l’enquête.

 One Grain of Rice, a picture book/youtube video that shows exponential growth Are you having trouble explaining the importance of exponential growth to people in your life. Many people can't picture it. They don't see the big deal at the start of the growth. When my kids were younger I read them the picture book, "One Grain of Rice" by Demi. 

It's the story of Rani, a clever girl who outsmarts a very selfish raja and saves her village. When offered a reward for a good deed, she asks only for one grain of rice, doubled each day for 30 days. Remember your math? That's lots of rice: enough to feed a village for a good long time--and to teach a greedy raja a lesson.

In April 2020, the unemployment rate rose 5.2 percentage points to 13%, following an increase of 2.2 percentage points in March. Since comparable data became available in 1976, the April 2020 unemployment rate is second only to the 13.1% observed in December 1982.

 COVID-19 Test Counts by Province &amp; Territory I followed the links in the pinned post and attempted to find the total number of tests performed in every province and territory, along with the results. Unfortunately I couldn't find any test counts for Newfoundland, PEI, Quebec, Nunavut, or the Yukon, although NL, PEI, and Nunavut do say they have no confirmed cases. Also my French is very rusty and I couldn't find the English-language COVID page for Quebec, so the confirmed cases for Quebec are from Public Health Canada. If you find an official source that fills in any of the blanks please comment with a link and I'll update this post. Otherwise my current plan is to check and update once a day.

A challenge with compiling and comparing these numbers is that every website has a slightly different system for reporting. The biggest variation is whether they count individual tests or persons tested or both; I've used persons when possible. Another is that BC includes recovered cases in the confirmed case counts (as does Public Health Canada), while Ontario excludes them. I've changed Ontario to match BC. If you find any other ambiguities or mismatches or have any suggestions, please comment.

 Canada's Failed Policies We are doing well compared to say the USA, plateau of new cases and hopefully soon some reduction. 

 [ 

Our measures are not enough though. 

 [ 

Provinces have varying recommendations, preventative measures are buried in text and we do not have a strategic and public plan for how to manage spread and restart our economy.

Is our government winging it? The message is always the same. "Practice social distancing and we are in this together." 

Great. What does that even mean? If my work is deemed essential and I am unable to practice social distancing what do I do? If I need to ride the bus what precautions do I take? Clear direction and response is needed. 

How about:

Hey Canada, we are going to make it federal law that everyone practice good hygiene until we get through this. Mandatory mask wearing in public and at work, mandatory changes to workplaces so that employees can work safely meeting all public health recommendations, mandatory hand hygiene requirements, mandatory changes on how we shop. A full stop Federal response, working with the Provinces and erring on the side of caution. Why are we not minimizing our risk and implementing measures Taiwan and South Korea have, using technology, streamlining our education to the public, and most importantly educating out of an abundance of caution. 

This is not hard and much of this can be implemented into daily life.  

[ 

The Federal response right now is all measures and supports. Where is the plan? What are we proposing for our future. What are we going to do so that we can actually restart business by the summer. 

I simply don't understand what Government is doing.

 What is the current state of the labour market in Canada? Quel est l’état actuel du marché du travail au Canada? We just released our new Labour Force Survey data, which are based on data collected from July 12 to 18, 2020. A new question was also added to this survey to report on the labour market conditions of population groups designated as visible minorities.

Here are a few highlights from this release:

* The national unemployment rate for individuals aged 15 to 69 was 11.3% (unadjusted for seasonality). Several population groups designated as visible minorities had joblessness rates significantly above this average, including South Asian (17.8%), Arab (17.3%), and Black (16.8%) Canadians.
* Employment rose by 419,000 (+2.4%) in July, compared with 953,000 (+5.8%) in June. Combined with gains of 290,000 in May, this brought employment to within 1.3 million (-7.0%) of its pre-COVID February level.
* Despite gains in July, employment continues to lag among youth, students, and low-wage workers.

Nous venons de publier nos nouvelles données de l’Enquête sur la population active, qui sont fondées sur des données recueillies du 12 au 18 juillet 2020. Une nouvelle question a également été ajoutée à cette enquête pour rendre compte de la situation sur le marché du travail des groupes de population désignés comme minorités visibles.

Voici quelques points saillants de ce communiqué :

* Le taux de chômage national chez les personnes âgées de 15 à 69 ans était de 11,3 % (données non désaisonnalisées). Plusieurs groupes de population désignés comme minorités visibles avaient un taux de chômage significativement au-dessus cette moyenne, y compris les Canadiens sud-asiatiques (17,8 %), arabes (17,3 %), et noirs (16,8 %).
* L’emploi a augmenté de 419 000 (+2,4 %) en juillet par rapport à 953 000 (+5,8 %) en juin. Cette hausse, combinée à l’augmentation de 290 000 enregistrée en mai, a ramené l’emploi à 1,3 million (-7,0 %) de son niveau observé en février, avant la COVID-19.
* Malgré les augmentations enregistrées en juillet, l’emploi continue d’accuser des retards chez les jeunes, les étudiants et les travailleurs faiblement rémunérés.

 Canadian Pandemic Influenza Preparedness: Planning Guidance for the Health Sector There has been significant discussion surrounding Canada's Pandemic planning, preparedness and standards.  For reference, this is Canada's current [Pandemic Influenza Preparedness: Planning Guidance for the Health Sector.](

It was developed in 2006 after the SARS inquiry and updated after MERS and H1N1.

These are detailed steps, measures and contingencies for Federal, Provincial and Municipal governments and public health authorities. 

For the most part, Canada is not following this Pandemic Plan because the Federal Government has not declared an emergency.   [Step 1 of this plan was never taken.](

*Planning for a prolonged and widespread health emergency of  unpredictable impact is challenging but essential. It requires a “whole  of society” response and the coordinated efforts of all levels of  government in collaboration with their stakeholders.*  

Many of us are struggling to understand why Canada finds itself facing new restrictions and wanting to know there is light at the end of the tunnel.  If you want to know why a measures is mandatory or optional, or what options exist for reopening, this is the gold standard.

 Quebec has banned all indoor and outdoor public gatherings The Legault government now prohibits "any indoor or outdoor gathering", with a few exceptions.

According to the decree adopted by the Council of Ministers, this prohibition does not apply to gatherings "bringing together the occupants of a private residence, or of what takes its place, and any other person offering them a service or whose support is required ”. "People offering a service or providing support must maintain, as far as possible, a minimum distance of two meters from the occupants," it says.

Another exception: a gathering is not prohibited "if it is required in a workplace that is not subject to a suspension from the Government of Quebec, provided that the employees maintain, as far as possible, a distance minimum of two meters between them ". The prohibition does not apply either "in a public place seeking a service or a good and which is not the subject of a suspension from the government of Quebec", such as a grocery store. Nor "in a means of transport, provided that users maintain, as far as possible, a minimum distance of two meters between them".

 Where can one buy an accurate oximeter? Many studies show many inexpensive ones are not accurate. "Many low-cost pulse oximeters sold to consumers demonstrate highly inaccurate readings. Unexpectedly, the accuracy of some low-cost pulse oximeters tested here performed similarly to more expensive, ISO-cleared units when measuring hypoxia in healthy subjects. None of those tested here met World Federation of Societies of Anaesthesiologists standards, and the ideal testing conditions do not necessarily translate these findings to the clinical setting. Nonetheless, further development of accurate, low-cost oximeters for use in clinical practice is feasible and, if pursued, could improve access to safe care, especially in low-income countries."

 A crowdsourcing application to uncover and predict the spread of COVID-19 in Canada Without enough testing, it's a real challenge to quantify the number of people affected by COVID-19 and understand how the virus spreads in Canada. [Coronastatus.ca]( is a community effort to help with this issue. It's a crowdsourcing application that collects data anonymously from volunteers using a self-assessment tool to help us uncover and predict the spread of COVID-19 in Canada. The goal here is to help authorities and emergency responders get a better idea of what's happening in your community and make informed decisions in their crisis response efforts.

The website is open-source and built by volunteers. The data is also open and anonymized, and everybody has access to all the contributions.

The health and safety of all Canadians is our top priority.

PHAC is working with provinces, territories and international partners, including the World Health Organization, to actively monitor the situation. Global efforts are focused on containment of the outbreak in China and the prevention of further spread.

Canada's Chief Public Health Officer of Canada is in close contact with provincial and territorial Chief Medical Officers of Health to ensure that any cases of COVID-19 occurring in Canada continue to be rapidly identified and managed in order to protect the health of Canadians.

Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory has implemented testing to diagnose COVID-19 from clinical specimens. The laboratory is working collaboratively with Canadian provincial public health laboratories to ensure there is additional testing capacity in multiple jurisdictions.

**As of February 25, 2020, British Columbia and Ontario are able to confirm laboratory diagnostics for the virus that causes COVID-19. For all other provinces, their results undergo additional testing at the National Microbiology Laboratory to provide further confirmation of initial laboratory findings. Please refer to information from provinces and territories for further test result summaries.**

As of March 2, 2020, the National Microbiology Laboratory has confirmed 506 negative cases and 14 positive cases of COVID-19.

Today, with 1526 new cases, it's the new lowest % increase (3.1%) we've seen since the outbreak began (since 100 cases). For the last four days, the % growth has been 3.3%, 3.4%, 3.4% and 3.1% (today); overall lowest numbers yet. Hopefully this declines further.
