 Why are Service Canada centres in Ontario closed when electronic stores, csr dealerships and pizzerias are still open? I along with many others need to go in person to pick up and process some documents, hundreds of thousands people need to apply for employment insurance and out of all places Service Canada is closed. Every single centre within 50-100km from me. Their phone lines are flooded and it's impossible to get through even after hours of waiting. Their website crashes and produces errors upon every request. If anything is an essential service at this time aside from groceries and pharmacies this should be it. What a joke.

 Sarnia: Fast Food I really don‚Äôt want to possibly get sued for naming names so... The red headed, pigtailed devil restaurant in Sarnia and the corporation they‚Äôre owned by are corrupt as hell. The GM continues to play favourites, even in a pandemic. She called in a manager who had traveled to the States less than a week after she got back, even though she was supposed to be two week quarantined. My boyfriend just got in trouble, sent home, and called three times because even though he was no where close to his mother (who was at her doctors a week ago around sick people) he put everyone there at major risk (but the manager isn‚Äôt?) Anyone else who calls in sick once, whether or not they have COVID-19, is forced to stay quarantined for 2 weeks. They‚Äôre trying to scare people into working. Not to mention trying to forcefully make employees take shifts. AND corporate are all on quarantine right now which is just so funny to me. Sarnia has declared a state of emergency, how the hell is fast food still open? The greed is unreal.

 Defining "essential" services Things like health care, first responders, groceries, pharmacies, and transportation of essential goods are the obvious exemptions, but we've all seen (and mercilessly mocked) Ontario's laundry list of exemptions for what can at best he considered secondary services. 

I think the issue is that once you really get into it, it's difficult to define essential vs non-essential in blanket terms. 

Many of the businesses classed as "essential" truly are not - at least not in the sense that they *all* need to be open or that they need to be open to everyone or at their full capacity. 

For example, no, Tim Hortons is not an essential service. That's absurd. However, truckers *are* essential and they need to have places to stop for meals and bathroom breaks every 3-5 hours, so we do need *some* restaurants and/or cafes open to service them. 

The problem is that we can't just arbitrarily pick one restaurant or cafe per town that gets to stay open while the rest are forced to shut down. 

Or can we? 

Maybe that is what we need to explore - how can we do that fairly? 

Or are there other alternatives we should be considering for how we feed and meet the bathroom and sanitation needs of essential services? 

I don't have a solution to present here, which is why I flaired this post as general discussion. 

One idea I'd like to toss out though is a lottery system for deciding which secondary services remain open to ensure that the needs of essential workers are met. Governments would have to determine how many of a business type need to be open per so many km and then businesses could choose whether or not to apply for the lottery. 

The only other option I can think of is to restrict the movement of people rather than the operation of businesses, but my initial assumption (please do correct me if I've got it wrong) is that enforcement would be both logistically challenging and much more expensive than the administrative costs associated with the lottery system. 

Anyways. These are my thoughts and I'd really love to hear some other ideas and people's responses to mine and other commenters ideas. 

Discuss.

 Canadian Healthcare Worker Perspectives? Hi there,

I live in the USA and am an RN here. Currently a pool of misery due to it. I'm curious how Canadian healthcare workers feel about it the situation where they work, how well you've been protected.

I wish we had universal heathcare here but, y'know, American Greed. I feel like countries with Universal Healthcare must have it much better than us. And that might appear incredibly obvious to y'all, but as you all might know, we live in and alternate reality here compared to the rest of the world, so it's nice to be reminded of it.

Thoughts?

 Charts comparing Canadian jurisdictions with &gt;10 cases with the US and UK I made some charts! I'm not a data analyst by any means, so I'd appreciate some feedback. I just got frustrated that there aren't good curves available to the public to show us what's happening with the outbreaks around the world.

[

I'm adding and tweaking these while holed up in my house, so any input is more than welcome.

The first chart shows the cumulative case count on a log scale against the number of days since the jurisdictions' 100th case. Allows us to compare outbreaks that started at different times more directly.

The other two are pretty straightforward. Cumulative case counts against the date.

I'm relying on wikipedia data because getting historical data is difficult from the public health agencies except for the NHS. I'll let the wonderful editors over at Wikipedia aggregate my data for me.

 My opinion for opening schools is that we need to do TESTING! Teachers and students should be tested everyday with rapid tests. Pandemics are driven by Children; this is a fact. Technology for 15 minute saliva tests which cost as much as a cup of coffee is available now. There is no excuse to open schools during a pandemic of a highly contagious and novel virus where children and young adults are known drivers, without testing frequently and rapidly. The science is there but the politics hasn't caught up. 

All parents should demand this. The sensitivity of the tests need to only identify those who are contagious. So it does not need to be a molecular test that detects even virus fragments and takes 2 days to get results. Canada needs to set an example to the USA and the rest of the world for how to open schools safely. I repeat, WE NEED FREQUENT AND RAPID SALIVA TESTING which is sensitive enough to only identify those who are shedding virus and are contagious. 

On a side note, I read an article today which surveyed 1,500 people about whether they feel safe to send their kids to school. Only 300 of the 1,500 actually had kids. What a joke. You have to be very out of touch with Covid to feel comfortable sending your kid to school. As a parent, I'm not sending my kids to school until i see what happens. You want to be the test subject?

 Can I refuse to come back into the office if I am high risk? Can I refuse work share that would require me to be present? Can I take leave and apply for benifits? PLEASE HELP! Would I be within my rights if I tell my boss to either let me work from home or lay me off during this pandemic?

Ok, so I work in an office setting for a large company (Canada). For background, I am 25 years old and have Myotonic Muscular Dystrophy (this puts me in the high risk category).

2 weeks ago I was asked to start working from home to limit the amount of people in our building. I was happy about this because we at the time had no confirmed cases in our city and I wanted to limit my exposure anyway. I had previously told my boss (before I was told to stay home) that once we started getting positive cases here then at that time I would like to work from home to minimize my risk.


Working at home has been fine (albeit a bit boring) but I think I‚Äôve been pretty productive. We now have almost 40 cases in my district since I‚Äôve been home. My boss (who knows about my health issues) asked me last week if I would like to switch out and go work in the branch so he can work at home for a week. I was a bit taken aback because I already told him once we get positive cases I don‚Äôt want to leave my house so I told him I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with it and he left it alone.

Now, this morning I get a text from him saying ‚Äúbtw all (job title)‚Äôs are now back in the branch‚Äù. I said ok that‚Äôs weird because we arnt even at peak yet in our city. He said ‚Äú2 week quarantine is up so they are back now‚Äù basically implying that I should be too. 

I again reminded him of my concerns which I think are increasingly valid as now the risk of contracting this is substantially higher than it was 2 weeks ago. And even in this 2 week period we had an employee that was confirmed to be exposed in the branch before it was discovered and he was sent home. This concerns me greatly and I‚Äôm having a lot of anxiety about this.
My boss basically said that lay offs for us may be coming and if that means I can stay at home I think I would rather that. I don‚Äôt think my boss really understands the seriousness of my condition even though I have explained it. The hard part is that I am young, and outwardly look ok even though I am symptomatic and confirmed to have the disease.

Am I within my legal rights if I tell my boss to either let me work from home for the foreseeable future or just lay me off? What should I tell him and how should I proceed? Can he force me to go back to the office?

I have provided my boss with a doctors note stating that I am at higher risk of complications and should work from home for the foreseeable future, I am still getting push back. I am non union and salary.

I am asking this because the fire alarms where I am are known for being dodgy and triggering when they shouldn't be triggered, and I don't want to go bankrupt from those fines.

 Transmission Dynamics in Kids at an Overnight Camp in Georgia - Published July 31st 2020 I read [THIS PAPER] ( last night in the US CDC‚Äôs weekly publication *Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report*. Given the recent publication, it is likely the media will not inform you about this until tomorrow if at all.

The paper describes transmission dynamics of Sars-CoV-2 in an overnight camp in Georgia. 

Background:

* An [attack rate](  is a fancy term for % infected.

* Only kids resident in Georgia attending this camp in Georgia would have had their positive tests counted. Both the numerator of the % infected and denominator of % infected was restricted to only consider Georgia resident camp attendees.

* Camp participants were not required to wear masks but staff were. 

* Overnight camps are an extreme example of a congregate setting with ultra-high exposure. More exposure = higher risk of transmission. Even though they are a bit more extreme than schools, both schools and overnight camps are youth-centric settings with high exposure.

**Key Points:**

*Median age of staff was 17 years. The attack rate for staff was 56%, meaning more than half got infected despite adhering to almost all guidelines (except window opening) and wearing face coverings. 

* In the table, you can see the attack rate for children aged 6-10 was 51%, *not dissimilar* to the staff attack rate. This is despite being a relatively small fraction of kids at the camp.

* There is a pattern showing younger individuals (6-10) were *more* infected than older kids (11-17) {Table 1}.

**My Personal Takeaways**:

Together with the other extremely recent study showing [10x-100x higher viral loads in young kids](  I‚Äôm fairly certain returning kids to school may not necessarily harm the kids (although some will undoubtedly be harmed) but will almost certainly turn them in to ‚Äúsuper-spreaders‚Äù. This is a common pattern with other viruses too. It‚Äôs increasingly clear to me that return to school will absolutely increase infections and likely supercharge the epidemiologic curve. My insomnia last night was not necessarily for the kids themselves but for **multigenerational households and older teachers**, who I expect to be a canary in the coal mine of sorts in September. As kids returns to school, I believe mortality can be expected to rise first among elderly teachers and elders living with kids.

Is there anything I can do about this? Anything I can apply to the government for?

 Why no call for small business? Sure "people should stay home".

If you don't tell small business to keep employees home, they won't.

I'm working today, in a service industry that definitely isn't essential because my boss says work is on, and I need to get paid. I'm one of 8ish technicians working today. Im scheduled to work this week and next. 

It's embarrassing to be out, let alone visiting 4-5 homes a day. (not to mentioning the calls for these appointments are still coming in. Yesterday we denied work to someone not self isolating after admitting they were traveling, which is good I guess) 

I truly believe as a nation we are responsible in times like this. The bound between Canadians really is comparable to few, we all want to keep each other safe. So how do we responsibly shut down non essential small business, given small business is what's drives Canada? A lot of the owners know nothing but work - it flows through them.

(I've voiced my concerns already to the boss - work as per normal. Can take time off unpaid if I wish. Like most people I'm a paycheck away from uncertainty)

 The Best Fair Way To Rescue The Economy During &amp; After NCOV Event Is Send Back Tax Payers Money **The Best Fair Way To Rescue The Economy During &amp; After NCOV Event Is Send Back Tax Payers Money**  
 

The Governments must stop stealing people money and send to their friends the big companies by bail out.  
 

If I was in charge of any nation,the most fair way to rescue the economy is:  
 **First:** Separate tax payer entities group with non-tax payer money groups for over last 4 years to 12 years depend on the situation.  
 **Second:**  
 \-Send back money to entities who have paid tax over the years by various method and formula including x2 x3 the amount of money they have paid.  
 \- While the non-tax payers groups: only support them by paying their essential bill like water, electric and rent with cap. Foods will be used food banks or something like that. Absolutely no sending money to this non-tax payer group.  
 

By doing that, you have set the new standard and send money to hard earn taxpayer people. While the entities have cheated the system will receive nothing.  
 

This is just few months event, if any companies cannot cope with the situation then let‚Äôs them disband.  
 

But the Governments must return the economy back as soon as possible, if the lock down beyond 50 days then it is illegal activities and made absolutely no sense what so ever.

I am not get paid to design policy for any nations so I just 	drop few essential framework ideas like above. You must do it 	yourself.

 Thoughts for those who are still preparing for COVID-19 Some thoughts I‚Äôve shared with my friends concerning COVID-19. Figured I‚Äôd share then here as well. 

If you don‚Äôt yet have two weeks of food and medication on hand in your home, go get it now. Don‚Äôt wait. Don‚Äôt panic, think about what you should have, and intentionally get to the store and buy what you will need. 

If you don‚Äôt have fridge or freezer space, then get dry goods and cans. Put them in a box in the corner. Ration out your comfort food (chips, beer, coffee, etc) Store next weeks stuff out of sight or you will eat all your snack and comfort food in three days. 

Don‚Äôt let your supplies drop below the two week threshold. At some point, we will all be confined exclusively to our homes unless we have urgent needs. Be prepared and you won‚Äôt have those urgent needs. 

Having urgent needs doesn‚Äôt include running out of milk. Figure out how to use everything you can afford to have on hand for food and supplies. Canned milk in your coffee is better than nothing if you don‚Äôt drink it black. 

Start to think about how you will manage your home if someone who lives there gets ill. Where will the sick person stay/sleep? How do you avoid cross contamination? Two people sick at the same time could be devastating. Think about alternate sleeping arrangements for a time of illness. 

Think about exposed surfaces and clothing. Minimize what will need to be cleaned. Take some clothing out of circulation so that the laundry pile stays manageable. Choose stuff that even your kids can wash for you. Don‚Äôt forget about your coats - they are automatically considered contaminated in my house. If they are hard to wash, put them away. 

Start washing sheets regularly. Clothes get washed every day. Change all towels before you go to bed. This is normal for some, but not for everyone. 

Figure out how to cook beans. Think about how you could make cookies. Learn to make soup from chicken bones.  For some of you this is completely foreign. Learn now. You will realize you don‚Äôt have everything you need. Then go get out while you can. Remember, minimum two weeks supplies. 

Get your neighbors phone number. Even that guy in the apartment next door you‚Äôve never talked to. Get their number and give them yours. It may become important. 

Do you have a thermometer, acetaminophen and ibuprofen? Do you have cough medication, suppressants and expectorants? FYI, a full bottle at max daily dose only lasts 6 days, so your family of four likely needs more than one bottle.  Are your prescriptions filled? Will they run out soon? Do you have enough refills on the prescription?

There will come a time when most of us will be spending 2-4 weeks without going out for supplies. Build a network with your neighbors so that if they lack something, they can ask you, and you can do the same. 

Don‚Äôt delay any longer. 

And most importantly,

If you have excess capacity, consider how you can share. You probably know someone who can‚Äôt afford to buy two weeks of supplies above their regular needs. Reach out and offer to help. Support your food bank. Give your tenants and employees the support they need.

 Good morning. This what happened yesterday. I thought it was weird that Trudeau made a point of saying he had no symptoms and he feels good.

When asked why he wasnt going to be tested he told journalists the virus is not detectable unless symptoms are present as the virus was not asymptomatically spread.

Think about that.

Only a couple weeks ago did the government admit asymptomatic spread was present.

And Justin just told a lie so he could take 2 weeks off during the greatest call to action mankind has ever faced.

Perhaps he was just misinformed.

Bruce Aylward, Canadas Doctor who headed the who mission to China, was asked to comment on Trudeaus insistance that any test performed would be negative because traces of the virus can only be found while experience symptoms.

Bruce said Trudeau was absolutely correct. He further explained how there was no evidence of the disease being spread by or even detected in people who were not displaying symptoms.

This message was relayed again that evening by Dr. Henry of British Columbia.




Here is where it gets interesting.

During the interview on CBC, Bruce interrupted the reporter for a brief minute to correct her on a minor detail.

The reporter had used the word "self-isolation" in relation to the pms 14 days that he will spend at his home with his wife and daughter.

She was informed by Bruce that Trudeau was in quarentine.

Like very specificaly.

Trudeau, who gave a speech to the nation.

Outside his house in front of reporters.

Was in quarentine.

This will probably be my last post.

The government and its media time slots have been telling us how great Canada has been doing.

Especially compare to the United States!üòä

People cant afford to even get a test done!üòä


Tomorrow morning we open the first testing facility in Ottawa.

People from across the province are expected to show up.

The policy for recieving a test was as follows:

Any Ontario residents experiencing symptoms are eligable to come to clinic.




This is the game here.
This is how they fuck you.


Tonight federal government announces they will only test people who are exhibiting sever symptoms.

These cases are advised to call 911 to be brought to the nearest hospital for testing.

The testing centers are still open and fully staffed.

Nurses and doctors sitting in an empty clinic.


EI policy is updated tonight!

In addition to current EI services, instant financial aid is available to anyone who finds themselves quarentined due to Covid-19.





Okay. So we are almost at the end here. I have to say. I don't think most people will be able to process this.


The Punchline: 

A distinction is made today between "self isolation" and "quarentine".

If YOU are sick and unable to work, but have not been tested.

YOU are in "self-isolation"

YOU are not eligable for any EI benifits.

If you do get tested it will be at a hospital and it will be because you need to be at a hospital.


Financial minister of Canada adresses the nation to annouce millions of dollars in capital for business across Canada in very uncertain times.

When asked how much of the economic stimulus package would directly go to Canadians who could not work due to ilness, but had not been tested and therefor did not qualify flr EI.

The minister recommended Canadians use credit from their local bank or a lender. He adds that much of the stimulus package adressed these issues in a proactive way.

Companies will immediately be investing in hiring.

Voluntary travel advisory yesterday recomends any Canadian returning from a country with a high number of cases self isolate for 2 weeks upon arrival.

Moments later mayor of Toronto returns from travel to UK.

Informs Canadians he is a good boy and will self isolate for 14 days during a national emergency.

Mayor of Toronto wants canadians to feel reassured that he has no symptoms and feels great.

Unfortunately he will have to self isolate for the entire 14 days because there is no way to test until he develops symptoms.


Good game.

 What are the requirements for using the Covid app? I know that the Covid app only works on certain versions of iOS. Are the versions it works with listed somewhere? Same question for Android. Also, does the app require a data plan to function? I think the answer is no, but I'd love it if someone could confirm. My parents don't have a cell phone. I'd like to get them an old, cheap one to use the app with. I'm trying to figure out how old I can go and still be able to use the app.

 Moving to Canada, can I make multiple trips from my car to my condo when I get there? I have to move back to Canada, and because of the virus I basically have to fit my possessions in my car, and sell, donate, throw out the rest. Maybe send a couple of boxes with UPS.

Any moving or storage option seems to cost more than any of my possessions are worth that I can't fit in my car. It's a shame to have to get rid of and then rebuy the exact same things, but I guess it's my only option.

When I get to my condo and park before quarantining, I won't possibly be able to carry what I need for 14 days in one trip. Can I make a couple of trips to my car and the condo and back?

 Commercial radio adding to the false sense of security in the public I was listening to the local rock station and the DJ said coronavirus is "no more fatal than the seasonal flu and only a little more contagious than the common cold." Not a mention about the asymptomatic nature, the long incubation period, the RO value, or any other characteristic that makes this virus different and more dangerous than the others. He also said we should "avoid the fear out there." Man that was frustrating, did not mention where he got these stats either. So you will have people continuing to be ignorant about this situation and not doing their own research, the radio guy said it so it must be true.

 I'm a substitute teacher in Alberta, what should I do? Hi all! I just need to figure out what to do. If this sort of post isn't allowed then I can delete this post.

So as the title says, I am a substitute teacher in Alberta. Everyday I don't work is a day I don't make money. Of course I need money to pay rent, bills, etc. but I can't shake this nagging, panicky feeling that I should start cancelling any sub jobs I have for the next while. I work in several different towns and one larger city. I would be an excellent carrier if I had it as I go to lots of different places. Should I start to cancel? I don't know what to do.

 my city (london) has very recently declared an emergency for our city. I am 29 and i have been self isolating and reducing contact by almost extreme measures. in the last 3 weeks i have only come into contact with 2 others 1 time (my close neighbours), and they have also been self isolating and taking this very seriously. my roomate who is 64 years old is regularily going out and 'running errands (aka getting beer)' and meeting up with other friends and family regularily.... every single day she has a total of 3-5 different people that she sees or hangs out with at my house alone. Should i be worried? they are also kind of dumb people (let me explain) , they believe masks will increase your chances of illness and they also believe hand moisturizer will protect them better than hand sanitizer or washing (they believe it acts as a barrier) .  i obviously realise how daft they are , but i also want to do my part.  


what can i say or do to improve the situation without getting kicked out? should i move out?  any advice will be appreciated, i realise this is a pretty dumb situation but its where i sit at the moment.

 Has anyone done any volunteering as a result of COVID19? If so, I'd love to interview you briefly! Hi folks. I'm volunteering for an initiative (an app, to be specific) that helps match and coordinate volunteers to run tasks around town with those who are in need during the COVID19 pandemic. 

I am doing user research on those who has started or have been volunteering as a result of COVID, in order to make better decisions on our product. 

The ask: a very brief questionnaire, then, if you opt in for the "willing to be interviewed" option in the questionnaire, a 20-30 semi-formal interview with me.

DM if you're willing to help out!

 Reactivate an existing EI claim or start a new one? I'm sure there may be other people in this situation. Looking to provide a little help to those in need and hopefully someone has 

I have been working contracts. I finished a contract in the middle of October and submitted an EI claim. I found a new contract pretty quickly which I started at the beginning of December. I only collected four or five weeks. They ended my contract early last week because of the virus. Gave me fair severance so I am ok for a little while. Just trying to figure out next steps. 

On the EI website they state:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;If you started a new EI claim within the last 52 weeks and there are still weeks payable on that claim, **we will automatically reactivate (renew) your existing claim.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**However, in some cases, it may be to your advantage to cancel or end your old claim earlier and start a new claim, because this may increase the amount of your benefits or the length of your benefit period**.  
&gt;  
&gt;You must decide whether or not to cancel or renew a claim based on your own personal situation. 

For me the question is whether or not applying again would lengthen my benefit period. 

There isn't really enough information provided on the site to make an informed decision on this. 

The site states that once you have started a new claim you cannot reactivate your old claim. So I have reactivated the old claim for now. My employer isn't submitting my ROE until Tuesday. I know I could have demanded the ROE and final payment more quickly but waiting a few more days won't hurt me. It also buys me some time.   


Smarter to reactivate the old claim until sure a new claim is the best route to go because:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Your decision to terminate a claim is final and cannot be changed.

 Centralized quarantine: any plans for it? Centralized quarantine means all people sick with COVID-19, even if not requiring hospitalization, go to a special facility to recover. The purpose is to prevent them from spreading the virus to their household (or to others if violating self-isolation), and to be able to provide prompt medical attention if required.

The analysis from China says this was a crucial part of the measures to eliminate the virus. I live in BC and have not heard of plans to do it. What about your area?

Here is some more info about centralized quarantine:

[

&gt; 1.  In the absence of intervention (before 1/23), the effective reproductive number R=3.8&gt;&gt;1, and dropped to R=0.3 after the massive intervention on Feb 1(centralized quarantine and treatment of all confirmed and suspected cases). This intervention worked.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;3. Family transmission is common. Quarantine-at-home between 1/23-2/1 helped and did not work effectively (R=1.35&gt;1), as family members and close contacts may be infected and might affect the neighborhood communities, e.g., going shopping.  Centralized quarantine is critical.

This means centralized quarantine was required in Wuhan to shrink the outbreak. The measures they had in place before that still had the outbreak growing, though at a reduced rate. (For background, R&gt;1 means the outbreak is increasing, and R&lt;1 means the outbreak is decreasing.)

Here is a video clip describing how the process works (apparently this can vary depending on region of China, but it gives the general idea): [ Also a podcast with the same reporter: [

A chart that shows how the size of the outbreak in Wuhan developed in response to the first measures and then centralized quarantine: [

 Do I qualify for EI or emergency fund? Hey, everyone just a situation I am in.. I quit my job in early December due to toxic environment. And I went to visit my family in Toronto and came back February. I finally got a job interview early March. I passed the first interview and the second interview was in the second week of March or close to it. They liked and said I would have to come in and train for my job but due to coronavirus they had been removed from the office therefore couldn‚Äôt train me for the job... so do I apply for EI or the emergency fund??? Any help would be greatly appreciated!! As I have to pay rent soon:/

 How serious is this virus? What is the situation in the Toronto area? Would love some unbiased information  As a skeptic of media reporting and data collection can any fellow torontonians attest to any community spread cases etc. Is there an undetected spread going on rn ?   

I‚Äôm seeing such conflicting attitudes regarding the severity of this virus, that I‚Äôm honestly unsure if it‚Äôs all some sort of over exaggerated hysteria fuelled by the media or if what is happening is something catastrophic.

With all the misinformation and speculation going on, clarification would go such a long way to deescalating people‚Äôs anxiety‚Äôs so we can take the appropriate measures proportionate to the situation instead of panic buying and selling. 

Stay healthy ppl !

 Need clarification regarding Christmas gathering rules (Ontario) - messed up ex-wife situation makes it complicated (Ontario) Here's the situation for our planned Christmas Eve dinner, it's a little bit messed up: our family is small and everyone comes in at 10 people except my girlfriend now becomes 11. The question is, how bad is it if we bring our total to 11, given:

* we are all already in each others' bubble
* we all otherwise obey all rules related to masks, washing, keeping isolated
* my dad has a health condition that will kill him in the next couple of years and wants as many full-family Christmases as he can (he loves to be surrounded by the entire family at meaningful events)
* two of the attendees are my young children (are they counted? children certainly don't count when it comes to limiting numbers of people in one place, e.g., attending school - FYI my kids attend theirs virtually)
* my parents' house (where this will be held) is large enough that we are not packed in like sardines

Considering that my vindictive ex-wife will interrogate the children and do the math, would we get in trouble if we have 11 people at the party and she calls the police after the fact? This is not to say that she will, but there is that concern.

Thanks for any advice and for not judging. We're trying to do the right thing while making dad happy.
