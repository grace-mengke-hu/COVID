 Spreading the virus with dr note Ontario has canceled waiting periods for people who are quarantined or self isolation. The catch is you need a dr note?? So go to the jam packed hospital or clinic sit there for  and most likely infect others or be possible infected?
I think these programs should be dropped and issue a basic income to all Canadian for duration of this pandemic. How can you stock up when your food budget barely scraping by now? Never mind the people that can't miss work or they don't eat and neither will their family? Native reserves that are only accessible by plane or boat?

 For those who went to Patio's, what safety regulations did you follow? Might go to my local restaurants' patio tomorrow. There has been only 1 case in my area within the last 21 days, and the restaurant I am thinking of heading to is right on the cusp of a neighborhood that hasn't had cases in the last three weeks, so I am thinking ok, its probably safe to go to a patio. For those who went to patios what safety precautions did you take?

 For safety precautions I was thinking this:

1)  Wear a face shield, goggles, KN95 mask with a TrioMed face mask over. I have the triomed face mask which kills 99.99% of Covid as tested by UOFT

2)  Use Gloves, and bring Lysol Wipes along with alcohol swipes

3)  When giving order and when server brings food, step away and keep 6 ft distance

4) Eat with the face shield on

5) Replace mask after eating, and maybe wear a KN95 on my nose to block particles, but outside is pretty safe no?

What are the best safety precautions to take on a patio

 Studies on how easily the virus is transmitted? This might not be allowed here, I'm not sure where else to put it.  


My current situation is that I live with my best friend, who is an ICU nurse in Victoria, BC. We are being very careful, having groceries delivered and all the hand washing.   
I'm having a hard time convincing my boyfriend, who lives in town too that it's not ok for him to come and live here for a while, lovely as that would be.  


He and his roommate have also been really careful and only go out for occasional runs and walks.  


He just doesn't buy that there is a risk when we have both been isolating for at least a month now. I've tried to explain so many times that there is still a risk from the incoming groceries and from passing people outside.   


My roommate is looking after non-COVID patients in the ICU and is understandably pretty worried about taking it there. He seems to think she is being overly paranoid. I'm hesitant to ask her to talk to him as I fear they would just end up arguing.   


I'm wondering if anyone has seen any studies on how easily the virus is transmitted? Or any other advice. He's a rational person and I think he's just really missing me.

 Can someone help me with this math on flattening the curve? Numbers I googled and am not sure are entirely accurate:

Number of acute care beds (2 per 1000 people): 0.002%  
Number of covid-19 patients requiring acute care: 2%  
Total infection rate: 50-75% of population  


Numbers I'm guessing on based on a few stories:  


Average length of acute care stay: 4 weeks.  


So lets pretend with social distancing we can reduce the infection rate to perfectly match the number of acute care beds so that as one person exits a bed, one more gets sick.  


With a 100x oversubscription of beds needed and a 4 week turn over that's about 16 years to work through the 50% of the population that'll get affected.

Now I get South Korea is the model so far for this for slowing down the infection rate but to what end? Do they have to spend over a decade managing this? If they stop now I assume they'll look like Italy given the contagiousness of this virus. If you don't stomp it out completely, it can come back to overwhelm you very quickly. 

From what I can see, there is no flattening the curve. There's no way a nation stays under these kind of restrictions for years on end. Seems to me like the goal is to buy time until a vaccine. 

What am I missing?

 The Winning Victory Conditions For Humanity In The War With The New Corona Virus NCOV **The Winning Victory Conditions For Humanity In The War With The New Corona Virus NCOV**  
 To me this is just a lesson for humanity to study and overcome.

Many of so called public national leaders have declared war with the new corona virus COVID-19, mainly because they are scare the shit &amp; may lose their power over people if this continue for few months.

In every games, sports, and even war with aggressive invaders in history, you always know the winning victory condition before go into the battle and fight.

But now in the battle against with invisible legendary corona virus NCOV, do any of you who are working and get paid for the job relate to COVID19 even know what is the winning condition yet?

Do you leaders/bosses even know and told you, yet?

Sadly, the answer is no. Most if not all of you have no clue what is going on, you guys are speculating and walking into wrong direction.

**Why I said that?**  
 Because you guys do not even know what is the victory condition path look like in a wide boderless desert, and their actions/policies tell me that.

For the public people to understand that:  
 Everything must start with theory, must begin with thought first, then with actions.

You guys must know that the **winning victory condition in theory** in this battle is fully know the features, weakness and strength of the new corona virus NCOV.

And the **winning condition in real life action** is people back to work “normally” like it used to without causing chaos.

I remind all of you that the new corona virus NCOV have around 70% the structure of SARS according to public media said.

And the SARS was “cured” in history not because of any drug or vaccine made in lab house, but rather than human know their feature, weakness by accident.

So the same path must apply to the new corona virus NCOV as well, there is no any other choice.

If you think any drug or vaccine can “cure” this virus then you are just a dreamer stupid people, it cannot happen in this world where you are living in because of the history and “majority law” say so.

Many of you have no champion characteristic, do not declare victory, do not smile until the battle finally end in real life.

If you cannot help your nation back to “normal”, then stop talking about helping other nations, it may be “help” in advance or “kill” action in the future when you fully know the features of this legendary beast NCOV.

Life is full of surprise, and this legendary beast have and will continue bring that to you, it is above level all of you.

You guys better wake up, give up and seeking help from outsider quick before it is too late.

 The major cities in Alberta have decided to go the route of mandatory mask - this should now mean there does not need to be any distancing precautions, correct? Since the very beginning it was said "Masks should be worn, when it is not possible to socially distance."  


Now that we are all wearing masks, there should no longer be a requirement for having to stand 6 feet away from someone, all self-checkout tills should be open, and there should not be a reduced capacity of store fronts.

&amp;#x200B;

If the above precautions continue - why did we mandate masks?  


I find this whole situation frustrating.. Never in the history of mankind has any governments ever been considered about the well being of people. Now all of a sudden, they do not want people to die. Would they be this interested if this pandemic didn't come with a side of citizen control?

 I no longer feel safe at work So I work in a printing press in a specific city in Manitoba, where the infection rate is apparently among the highest in the country now, and I'm scared to be at work. Of the 5 of us who actually run the press, I am the only one who wears a mask all day, the head guy thinks this is all not a big deal and a government power play, and thinks the fines are stupid. Now thats manageable on its own, I guess, but here's the thing: I'm asthmatic, and have enough trouble breathing in winter normally, we print newspapers that go to several provinces, and apparently some strains of covid can live on paper for up to 5 days? On top of that, my wife works in the library, so even with their pickup only setup, if I get her sick, it circumvents their whole book quarantine process. On top of everything else, a business connected to our shop had a positive case, and that man actually shares our bathroom, I encountered him often, before I started masking up, though he always wore a mask when he came over. I didn't get infected but it contributes to my fear. What can I do here?

 Expanding NS testing: "We're up for the challenge" THIS is how public health officials gain community trust (Dr. Tam take note): being upfront and honest (See last quoted paragraphs). 

I am *for the most part* incredibly proud at Nova Scotia's response. We have enough PPE to handle the uptick in cases so far, we are expanding testing and lab capacity like crazy, and the government is learning how to communicate what is important to people. Our numbers would be a lot worse were it not for Dr. Strang's wisdom and guidance. 

[

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The government says it has also expanded the list of symptoms being screened for COVID-19. They are:  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Fever.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- New or worsening cough.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Sore throat.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Runny nose.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Headache.  
&gt;  
&gt;If you have two or more of those symptoms, visit [811's website]( to determine if you should call 811 for further assessment.  
&gt;  
&gt;With the expanded testing, Strang assured 811 has enough people in its assessment centres to handle the requests.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;"Quite frankly, they said to me, 'We're up for the challenge of  testing as many Nova Scotians in this as necessary,'" Strang said.  
&gt;  
&gt;He said testing is a key part of the strategy to minimize the spread of COVID-19.  
&gt;  
&gt;Strang said the number of cases appearing in Nova Scotia is because of the province's testing strategy.  
&gt;  
&gt;"I really firmly believe that we have a very kind of gold standard of a testing strategy," Strang said.   
&gt;  
&gt;"We  have lab capacity, we've opened up access and now we're looking for it  in our in Nova Scotia communities in a very aggressive way."  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;Strang said while there is evidence of community spread, it's  not widespread, except in communities that were singled out on Tuesday:  Enfield, Cherry Brook, East Preston and North Preston.  
&gt;  
&gt;"And  that's not a reflection of those communities, it's just an honest,  truthful reflection of where this is an active disease within a part of  our province," Strang said.

 Job is putting all of us at risk and more because of COVID I work at a fast food restaurant here in Canada and my job is putting myself, all our employees and customers at risk. Recently we were told if you traveled anywhere outside of Canada you were not to return to work and to quarantine yourself for 2 weeks in case you may have COVID and spread it around. 2 of our employees have traveled to the US and have since returned to work. The reason is pretty simple, we aren't getting paid if we have to quarantine ourselves so they feel like they have to return to work if they want to be able to pay bills. Many of us don't qualify for EI because our business isn't closing due to the virus so we can't get any support. Many of us are being pressured to take extra shifts as anyone who calls in sick is not allowed to return to work for 2 weeks and their shifts are posted. Many of us are working more than 50 hours a week with little sleep and are scared of not coming in and not being able to survive. Many of our rights are being ignored. Today I didn't not recieve a break after working for over 5 hours straight and decided to just leave as no one would allow me my break. Many people are working 12 hour shifts and expected to go home and come back in for more work without the legal 8 hour downtime. Employees are scared of getting sick and they are scared of coming to work. 
Is there anything we can do as a group to maybe pressure the company in giving people some paid time off or maybe some hazard pay for coming in? We all make minimum wage but it doesn't feel worth risking our health and safety and those around us just so people can have fast food instead of cooking.

 TheWorld.Data.Blog Is Providing Cure Solution, Real Knowledge About Corona Virus NCOV COVID-19 **TheWorld.Data.Blog Is Providing Cure Solution, Real Knowledge About Corona Virus NCOV COVID-19**

The authority, government and many organization are hiding a lot of real info about the new corona virus from the public for whatever reasons like lose the regime, cause chaos or continue enslave the people, not just only China, Vietnam must also including USA, Europe, etc. All over place.

So if you are seeking for the truth information, real knowledge, uncensored news, open discussion, cure &amp; solution for the new corona virus named as NCOV, COVID-19 or SARS-COV-2, then the only webpage online is **theworld.data.blog** and **freejoy.aimoo.com**.

The fact is that the media &amp; government are toying with people’s life. They are only promoting fear and scare to face the truth. They were not telling the real information about the corona virus from the beginning and probably in the future as well.

Even I as a Savior want to telling you the truth, real information about this epidemic with just text-based message, they think me as fear-maker, and delete all the messages online. Many of my information now even scientist was confirmed like the started for this epidemic event from October/November or the real features of this virus, but many still not yet confirmed and verified yet.

If they say cannot talk in the public or big media sites, then it would be ok, but instead they are deny in all fake free speech websites as well.

You need to understand that even the top government officials, top doctors who have access to top notch medical care had died because of this new corona virus, they cannot protect themselves so there is freaking any reason they can protect normal people like most of you.

The new corona virus is not yet peak, the full strength of that virus will only appear in the summer time. The current situation is too dangerous for normal people to deal with.

That why from now I will provide free working cure &amp; solution at private matter for all of you, if you are rich (have more than 5 millions USD worth of asset) then you must donate money, but all with restrict conditions and limited time. But only at **theworld.data.blog** or **freejoy.aimoo.com**.

But if you are willing to open your mind, want to face the scary hard truth, accept new knowledge then you can visit that websites. If you are the anti-christ with big ego and do not want to change, then do not visit.

Remember everything has the limit and I have the final decision of anything on that website.

The authority cannot save you, only you can save you, and only the savior can give you real working advice, cure &amp; solution to overcome this crazy epidemic event.

 Urgent help needed for my best friend. First up, I'm not looking for an online diagnoses, I am seeking advice and creative suggestions for how to get my best friend a COVID-19 test. My best friend quite possibly has COVID-19 (right symptoms for it, had the flu shot already etc.). I live in a reasonably small town in Ontario with no confirmed cases. She has not traveled but she easily meets 50+ people in a day because of her two different jobs, a teaching assistant, and a deli worker at a large chain grocery store. She has contacted Telehealth Ontario multiple times over the last 3 days and has been unable to get past the queue. The local health unit refuses to test her. She has no GP or anyone else she can phone for help or advice.

Please, if anyone has any tip, trick, out of the box solution, or personal experience where they successfully got tested. Please help me. 

This is important that she be tested because

1. She is my best friend and has no one to look after her, as she lives alone, I cannot go and help her as I already have to look after my 60+ parent whom lives with me. My friend has no other friends and her parents live far away.
2. She worked at a major grocery store in my town at the deli with symptoms. I have already chastised her enough for her stupidity in this, as well as spent weeks to months IN ADVANCE educating her on why she shouldn't do this. Unfortunately, she didn't listen to me and didn't tell me about her symptoms until she had already worked there 3 days in a row. Because of this, she needs to be tested so that her coworkers can be quarantined and the deli can be shut down and hopefully (though this is a long shot) the people who bought food made by her can be contacted.
3. There are no confirmed cases within hundreds of miles from me, if there is community spread in my city people need to know.

I know there will probably be a lot of comments saying "no ones testing" or "can't get tested if you don't meet the requirements", I know those things already and don't need to see them again. I'm pessimistic enough already, I already feel powerless to help my friend. I am looking for solutions, not more hopelessness to make me more "realistic", I have enough of that from my own thoughts already.

I'm NOT glad that we provincial disability benefits handout bums will be the only segment of society still subsisting on less than $1,000 a month.  It makes us an official underclass receiving half the amount of handout that CERB recipients are receiving.

That's not a personal complaint.  I've spent 14 years surviving on little money.  It's nothing new to me.  But I don't like it that I'm becoming officially defined as "the undeserving poor" for the sole reason that I'm disabled.  It's bigoted and unjust.

 Random thought about TP in the age of Covid-19 Toilet paper shortages are thankfully diminishing. But toilet paper use is likely greater, at least toilet paper purchased at retail stores and used in people’s homes. This makes sense because many people are now staying home instead of spending a large part of their day at work or school. Also people no longer spend a portion of their free time in malls, restaurants, theatres, arenas and rec centres, and other community based areas (including visiting people in hospitals). Facilities outside homes often have washrooms with special larger toilet rolls. The home-size toilet paper rolls are seeing more demand - and the commercial type toilet rolls are probably seeing reduced demand. Some of that TP buying frenzy was probably caused in part by a sudden increased demand. Hopefully production is keeping up with the change in where we “go” 🧻

Yet nobody is going to throw a smoker in jail.    For that matter, alcohol as well.    The government actually makes profit from selling alcohol and cigarettes.    Also, there are people that just don't have the same beliefs about the virus, that the main stream people do.    Can we really dictate what they are and aren't supposed to believe?

 Will this end? I'll admit I'm having a difficult time mentally with the lockdown, as I imagine quite a few people are. I looked at my 3 year old tonight and I genuinely wondered - will this end???

I thought we had a boring life before. Work, school, have dinner, do it all over again, movie Friday night, go to the local coffee shop Saturday mornings, vacation once a year. Seems quite luxurious now. I'm honestly questioning if that will be normal, again?

 I work in construction, and we shouldn't be working As a worker in the industry, I can say we are not able to follow the hygiene and social distance measures recommended by health officials. We have two washrooms with hand washing stations, and the rest have no sanitizer. We have no masks. No one can order more of these supplies....they don't exist. 

I'm scared to go to work on Monday. I'm scared for everyone else who has to go to work in any non essential industry. We are actively spreading disease. 

How do we get our sites shut down? Can someone start a petition? I'm bad at computers and don't know where to start.

 Are DIY face masks at all beneficial to stop virus spread? and if yes what kind of things can you do to make a better mask? Hi! Mildly inept Reddit user here (can't figure out how to make this a discussion post sorry) 

 I don't have any face masks and want to improve my chances of not getting the virus and also not accidently spreading it will my work rushes to be ready to shut down for a while.

So my question it

1.Do DIY face masks work well?

2.What can I do to improve the quality of my DIY face mask?

3.If I sew one can I clean it and reuse or is that silly and unreasonable?

I work in a small family run business that takes me all over the city and often multiple locations a day for work and recently as cases go up in my city (Edmonton) I am understandably more concerned about going to work which I have to as I need to pay for things and also don't want to screw over my work as they are good to me and well I am outside of work doing as much social distancing as I can I know that work is my vector to get infected.

Thank you for any advice!

 Common cold and other diseases One of the side effects of everyone staying home seems to be that other causes of death like car accidents have dropped way off...which is a good thing.  


I was thinking about this last night, I wonder if everyone staying home may have a (at least short term) positive effect on other diseases.    I could see it wiping out the common cold for example.  (Although if there's pockets of it around it would come back eventually)

 Many Sacred Religion Books Have The Cure For The New Corona Virus NCOV **Many Sacred Religion Books Have The Cure For The New Corona Virus NCOV**  
 

Many sacred teaching in many religion books have talked and provided method to solve the problem related to virus. Example: the Bible, Quran, Torah, etc.  
 

You should not wait and trust the science and technology for they are limited and made from “unripe” material called as metals.  
 

You should not expect the “cure” come from the governments and authorities for they are not allowed to talk it directly even if they know it.  
 

Fasting like Ramadan will help you increase health overall.  
 Going for vegan diet for certain amount of day will also increase health and your intelligence.  
 I can guarantee that the % of people got “positive test” NCOV infected mostly from animal meat eater.  
 Where are the real detail statistics, oh wait the Government and authorities will never tell you !!!  
 

That is just few examples from religion teaching.  
 Instead of waiting for others, you guys better spend time do some research to increase your knowledge and health overall.  
 

The Corona Virus NCOV is not evil but humans are evil for they only blaming instead of take responsibility for their own action.  
 

Many sacred religion books are the gifts from “above” and they have much more real life knowledge than any man-made school education book.  
 

Wake up and experiment the magic of life.  
 

Best Regard,

 The schools are super spreader events.  

 I always speculated that schools were superspreader events. How could they not be. Drive by any elementary school when the kids are out at recess and the kids are all playing happily, wrestling, playing tag etc etc as kids are wont to do. Most or many are maskless outside.

The virus is readily spreading amongst kids but most kids do not manifest outward illness. As such most kids are not being tested, so the official line is there is not much covid in the schools. This is huge B.S. and it will shortly come out that there are problems in the schools regarding covid. They are spreading to adults who manifest illness, and amongst people who are older and eventually it ends up in older adults who get the sickest.

 Can Ontario hospital nurses refuse to work? Hello! 

My mother is 67 years old, with asthma, she's a cancer survivor, and 2.5 months away from retirement. 

Given the new legislation, does she have a leg to stand on if she refuses going to work? 

I get that not all medical staff can turn away, because we need people working, but she's incredibly high risk, and it worries me. 

Her hospital has already said they cannot provide her and her unit with masks, so she will be working as if everything is just another day.

Any advice you can provide would be greatly appreciated!

 Corona Virus in BC and Social Distancing Hi All,

Today on Global news BC, when asked if BC could eventually limit entry into BC from Alberta and Washington State, but while slowly going back to business and decreasing social distancing before other provinces given we are bending the curve much more, Dr Henry answer was no and that we are all in this together. 

Ok so guys to confirm this means we will need to wait until Quebec and Ontario are in a good place before we can start any official decrease in social distancing in any province including BC ? 

If so then understood. Just want to make sure my understanding is correct.  Thanks,

 Not adhering to self-isolation after traveling (Ontario) I had met a girl at a party in January who suggested that we follow each other on Instagram. A bit of a background on her, she is in her late 20s, lives with her parents in Markham, and wants to be an Instagram influencer.

During stage one of isolation, she would post photos of herself drinking with 4-5 friends inside a home, new groups each time. Most recently, she traveled to Mexico with an American (from Miami) and posted many stories of her partying with the locals and him. She came back to Toronto around August 13th. We know this because she posted posts of her plane tickets traveling back. Within a week of her being home, she is posting stories of her hiking with her mother and eating out a restaurant. She was also at the bar with a boxing gym trainer from a downtown Toronto studio. 

My friend has attempted to call 311, but they said that they would require her address and directed her to Public Health Toronto. Public Health Toronto recommended that he contact the Canadian Border Services Agency who directed them to contact Public Health Ontario (PHO). He was only able to leave a voice message with PHO. 

The birthday girl did reach out to her over text regarding her behavior but was left on read.

We are growing increasingly frustrated because we feel that there is nothing we can do and are seriously concerned about the health and safety of the community. We are now inching closer to the end of her supposed two-week quarantine. If this were to happen again in the future, who should we contact in Ontario?
