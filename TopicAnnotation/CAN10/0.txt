 For those who went to Patio's, what safety regulations did you follow? Might go to my local restaurants' patio tomorrow. There has been only 1 case in my area within the last 21 days, and the restaurant I am thinking of heading to is right on the cusp of a neighborhood that hasn't had cases in the last three weeks, so I am thinking ok, its probably safe to go to a patio. For those who went to patios what safety precautions did you take?

 For safety precautions I was thinking this:

1)  Wear a face shield, goggles, KN95 mask with a TrioMed face mask over. I have the triomed face mask which kills 99.99% of Covid as tested by UOFT

2)  Use Gloves, and bring Lysol Wipes along with alcohol swipes

3)  When giving order and when server brings food, step away and keep 6 ft distance

4) Eat with the face shield on

5) Replace mask after eating, and maybe wear a KN95 on my nose to block particles, but outside is pretty safe no?

 It has been PROVEN that masks are INEFFECTIVE against COVID-19. This can be demonstrated by vaping while wearing a surgical, cotton/cloth, sponge or N-95 mask. 



The aerosols produced by an e-cigarette (or “vape”) have a size of approximately 120-165 nanometers. The aerosols in the exhaled vape easily exit the mask VISIBLY between the point of contact of the face and the mask. In some masks, the aerosols even go THROUGH the front of the mask.  Consequently, the viral particles also pass around/through the mask; a COVID-19 viral particle is approximately 60-140 nanometers in diameter, which is even smaller than aerosol particles, on average. It is therefore pointless to wear a mask unless you plan on sneezing/coughing in someone’s face because it only blocks large droplets effectively (but your elbow can do this for you) If you walk down the same aisle as someone else in a grocery store or go anywhere remotely near the place they walked (while both wearing masks and keeping a 2-meter distance), you are still very likely to inhale viral particles as they remain in the air for ~ 3 HOURS. 

Let me know why you think I’m wrong, if you disagree.

 Opinion on wearing a mask? Hi all, as we all heard on the news with Dr. Bonnie Henry and the WHO, they have done a 180 on wearing a cloth mask. From No, to it doesn't hurt but does nothing, to well maybe, to now we recommend you wear a cloth mask to protect others around you. Many people will say this was common sense from the beginning.

Still though I still see most people not wearing one at the grocery stores here in the Metro Vancouver area. I see both sides on this one.

Firstly i'ts useful if and only if you wash your hand and face, them put it on properly, don't touch the mask as you wear it, later wash your hands, take it off, then wash your hands / face again.

Ok so obviously most people don't do all of this because it's tough and we've all seen people put their mask on their chin and even on top of their head / hair while they eat / drink. Then put it back on at that point it seem more just for show to wear a mask if you don't want to be seen not wearing one.

On the other hand the mask isn't to protect yourself but for others around you so even worst case if you dirty your own mask and still wear it the point is every breath you exhale, cough or sneeze, it's there to block it. So maybe it's still worth it in that sense?

Guys let me know what you think. Countries like Taiwan and China wear masks all the time and they say that was part of how they beat it and you have to think they are not all able to wash up before and after taking it off and not touch the mask so maybe either way it does work?

Edit: For those asking if I wear a mask.  Yes I do when I'm out for grocery shopping. I don't when I'm jogging alone in a nearby park. I don't go out for any other reasons. With that said I'm just looking for other people's thoughts on the subject and not really whether their opinion is different from my situation. After all I see people who wear a mask all the time and others who never do. Maybe each side knows something I don't so I'd like to hear from both. Thanks.
