 We have been doing it all wrong. Looking at google mobility data reports of Taiwan vs Canada and United states and also comparing the number of infected cases, one can quickly realize that we are or have been doing it all wrong. Taiwan citizens kept most if not all of their freedom with very few infected case [(At the moment of writing: 363)]( while Canada as 14,426 and United States 331,151 (That is 1000 times more). And yet, while we are lockdown in our homes, Taiwan is enjoying their time under the sun!

Lets keep in mind that Taiwan is neighbor to China and has a very much higher population density than either Canada or United States which would "normally" make Taiwan much more susceptible to have higher infections rates.

See the numbers dated March 29:

 Ontario Case Projections   



I dug into the Ontario case disclosures ( [ and [ to try to disentangle the signal from the noise given the bumps in the testing/reporting process.

Hopefully this will give a more forward looking estimate on if we are bending the curve here in Ontario. If the data generates interest I will do my best to update it each day and refine my projections.

   
 

I have compiled four series of data using the following methodology.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Current Cases Per Day: estimated from the pdf data's      episode date.
2. Cumulative Cases: again estimated from the pdf data's      episode date. Add up all of the current cases per day up until that date.
3. Projected Case Per Day: estimated by

i) calculating the difference in current cases per day between the March 31stand April 1st.

ii) Add the increase in cases for all previous cases to the current case count. Sofor example for the March 26th date in the April 1st report there were 140 cases. Between the March 31st and April 1st there were 224 new cases added for all days before march 26th. So I add 140 + 224 to get a projected total of 364.

iii) I deflate the added value by the change in the number of tests under investigations. So from March 31st to April 31st the number of tests outstanding went from 4280 to 3135. So for the above example I multiple 364\*(3135/4280) = 304.

4) Projected Cumulative Cases: estimated by adding up all the projected cases per day up until that point

   
 

The Episode Date is defined as on the public health website ([ as "an estimate of the onset date of the disease for the case" the following heirechy is in place:

"1) Onset Date ; 2) Specimen Collection Date; 3) Laboratory Test Date; 4) Report Date).

 Alberta reports 27 new cases of COVID-19 bringing total to 146 - up to 8 are community transmission - 1 death reported in Edmonton 
++++++++++
 [Toronto Star]“70% of new infections are coming from the broader community” “Ontario’s regional health units are reporting another 24-hour period with more than 400 new COVID-19 cases as the rate of new infections has continued to rise in recent days, according to the Star’s latest count.

As of 11 a.m. Saturday, the health units had reported a total of 26,301 confirmed and probable cases, including 2,114 deaths.

The total of 475 new confirmed and probable cases reported since the same time Friday morning was once again up from recent daily averages, a sign the provincewide decline in infection rate has reversed in recent days.

Meanwhile, the recent increase in cases is now primarily coming from infections in the broader community outside outbreaks in places like seniors homes, according to a Star analysis based on data from Ontario’s hardest-hit health units. In mid-April, at the peak of infections in the province, most new case appeared in institutional outbreaks; since then, the rate of outbreak cases have fallen, and now about 70 per cent of new infections are coming in the broader community.

On Saturday morning, the province released its version of the same data, which showed the same trends.

The province once again reported another day in which testing labs completed far fewer COVID-19 tests than the target of 16,000 daily. The 11,028 tests completed the previous day was the sixth straight well below the target. The province says the labs have the capacity to complete about 20,000 tests daily; last week they completed as many as 18,354 in a day.

In the past, spikes in case counts have followed days with high testing rates, and vice versa for days of low testing.

The number of new cases reported each day had been on a downward trend since hitting a peak of more than 700 in late April. However, the average has begun to rise slightly after flattening out to about 360 cases per day last week; before this week, the province last saw more than 400 cases on May 8.

Meanwhile, the 24 fatal cases reported in the province since Friday morning was back in line with the recent falling trend. The rate of deaths is down considerably since peaking at more than 90 deaths in a day earlier this month, about two weeks after the peak in the daily case totals.”

 CDC adjusts death count - comorbidities Hey all,

Genuinely curious if someone can explain the effect of CDC adjusting how they're counting covid deaths. 

According to their new data only 6% of deaths in the US have been from covid19 on its own. The other 94% had another health condition directly involved in the cause of death. 

Does this change anything or give us anymore information we didn't already know? 

In healthy people this would make it seem like the actual mortality rate from covid19 alone is extremely low. Do we just have an extremely unhealthy population?
++++++++++
 Why does tracking focus on total cases vs active cases? Just an observation, it seems like all tracking websites and headlines focus on the total number of cases instead of the active number of cases.

To me, the active number seems much more relevant, and should be the focus.

Am I overlooking something?

 I’m no statistician, but if we’re not testing some consistently sized random sample of the population, how can you draw any conclusions from the number of cases? Provinces and other jurisdictions keep posting numbers of detected cases. 

However, the number of people that are being tested and the criteria for being eligible for a test vary wildly. 

I don’t see how you could draw any meaningful conclusions from the resulting data when the testing is so inconsistent. 

Am I missing something?

 It would be so useful to be able to retrace the steps of all confirmed cases so far and going forward I feel like there isn't enough awareness and information around all the confirmed cases so far, aside from the one case of the woman who got on the GO Bus in Ontario. The main purpose of this would be to alert those who might have come in close contact to a confirmed case.

South Korea has taken this a step further where companies have set up websites and alerts that help track where confirmed cases had been to keep people informed and alert.

 Things are not improving here in Canada I hear a lot of people talk about how things are improving, but the number of active cases keep increasing and it'll only get worse once schools open, and even more if they open the border and let Americans in.

 Some more positive news: Active cases in Ontario goes down for the first time today Active cases (defined as total cases minus recoveries and deaths) went down today for the first time (from 5,675 to 5,597). I hope this downward trend continues and that 25th April will remain our peak date (for reported cases).

Keep in mind: all these numbers come with some imperfections / uncertainty starting from lag in infection to getting tested to getting results, definitions of 'recoveries', undetected cases and uncertainty around cases in LTCs.

Ontario also reported the lowest number of deaths since April 13th, so the decline in active cases is also not due to a large daily death toll.

 Deaths in 0-19-year-olds in Canada My count is still 4-6 deaths in this age range but the data is still flowing to the official count.  It would be much more useful if there was a data series available showing the dates because if the case count is 13,175 today but the deaths that are being reported occured in April then it is really hard to know how dangerous this actually is to kids.

13,175 cumulative cases in 0-19 year olds

***~~Ontario’s death toll was listed as 36 yesterday, but is now 33. This is quite confusing. The death toll is currently counted as 36 in Ontario until further news.~~ Death toll in Ontario confirmed to be 37 with today’s 4 new deaths, therefore, I am adding only 1 new death today for Ontario to fix the error.
